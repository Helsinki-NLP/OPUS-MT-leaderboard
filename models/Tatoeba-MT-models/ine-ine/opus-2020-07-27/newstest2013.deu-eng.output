A republican to meet Obama's recovery
The leading forces of the Republicans justifie their commitments with the need to combat the choice deficiency.
However, the Brennan Center believes the last for a mythos, confirming that the choice in the United States is rare than the number of people killed by the attack.
The laws of the Republicans have been in the United States in 10 years but only 300 cases of election.
One is certain: these new provisions will be negatively affected by election.
In this regard, these measures are partly undergoing the United States democratic system.
In contrast to Canada, the United States are responsible for the implementation of elections in individual countries.
In this regard, the majority of the Governments have announced new laws since 2009 that difficult the procedure for registration or transition.
This phenomenon has won significant significance in the elections of November 2010, where 675 new Republican representatives were able to be deployed in 26 countries.
Therefore, 180 legislative drafts were introduced only in 2011, which restricted the exercise of the election law in 41 countries.
The new election law requires the electors to present a light image evidence and evidence of the US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws reduce the periods for the preliminary vote taxation, declare the right to register themselves as electors on the electoral day, and the citizens shall approve the election right for which a court is predicted.
Before the elections of 2006, no US State requested the electors to provide a light image evidence.
Indiana was the first federal state who raised such a requirement.
In 2008, the General Court of Justice of the United States visited the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The Republican authorities claimed to extend these practices to other countries.
During the last two years, they encouraged the draft legislation in 34 federal states with which the electors were forced to provide a light image evidence.
It is important to note that the U.S. citizens, contrary to Quebec, do not have over a universal cart such as the hospital insurance cards.
In fact, 11% of the U.S. citizens, which are 21 million electoral persons, are no evidence of light images issued by a government member of their state.
Furthermore, five million new elections in 2012 have no such exhibition.
Nevertheless, more than 100% are often to get the necessary evidence.
From the new restrictions, young people, minorities and people with low income are unproportionally strongly affected.
In fact, 25% of the Afro-Amers have, 15% of the people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of the electors between 18 and 29 years are not over the necessary evidence of light image.
This is still enough.
Students who are viewed as electors who give up their voice for democracy candidates are not allowed in several countries to use their light image evidence issued by their establishment.
On the other hand, the same States allow Members of Angel- or Jagd-Unis to choose more for the Republican side to use cards for elections issued by these United States.
Before 2004, no State has requested a proof of the citizenship.
Arına was the first federal state who introduced such a requirement.
Since 2011, a thousand States have prevailed laws that require the electors to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly concerned about limiting the Spanish votes.
Because it is on the hand that two of the three Spanish electors prefer the democratic party.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators in 2011 promoted laws in eight federal states with which the registration of electors was dismissed on the election day.
Furthermore, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide the electors who want to register themselves.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for electoral registration at the general elections of 2004 have to register approximately 10 million citizens.
Because the measures that have been taken since 2009 have reduced the share of the registration of new electors in 2010 in comparison with 2006 to 17%.
In five other federal states, the Republican legislators have prevailed laws aiming at reducing the period for the preliminary vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the electors previously chosen were Afro-Amer, though only 13% of the electors of the State.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
Lastly, only 11% of the electors, but 24% of the citizens who had previously chosen.
On the contrary, the whites represented 76% of the electors represented only 46% of the electors previously chosen.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their attachers have energy contrary to the derogation of laws that deteriorate the registration of electors.
Several legislative drafts were blocked by the Vetos of the Democratic Governors.
The U.S. Advocate General has adopted the best laws.
They could have limited the damage partly.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal states have prevailed laws that require the predictment of a light image.
However, the new imported rules in 2012 will certainly be difficult to exercise the election right.
The democratic criticians deploy the part-political nature of the laws which have been rejected and see the impact of the results in the states exposed for 2012.
A report from the Brandan Center of 2011 shows that those States who have proposed these laws will vote 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral bodies to win the presidency.
It is too early to make sure that these amendments to the election system will have significant impact on the result of the presidency elections in 2012.
But one is certain: these new provisions will be negatively affected by election.
In this regard, these measures are partly undergoing the United States democratic system.
Prostatal rab rab first recognition: should the test be made or not?
The PSA test is wise in fact sometimes wrong results, with false negative or but false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to strengthening pounds of men already unexpected for the implementation of early tests.
Whether the test should be done or not
We have received the opinion of two experts.
There were many factors between the control groups in the United States, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to give clear recommendations.
Another, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a subdivision in the death of patients with and without early knowledge.
This has also shown that in a monitoring after 12 years, the probability of the education of metastases is 30 to 40% if no previous recognition has been performed.
That is why I recommend the test from a 50-year-old or 40-year-old test when you have a direct relative who had already been ill on the prostatacacryb.
In men of Afro-American origin, there is also a risk.
The most important is to make the right decision, soon as a cancer disease has been recognized.
There are types of cancer, aggressive and other indolents.
The patient must really understand the risk of his cancer disease by showing him the possible options in which prostatax can remain untreated if he does not affect the long-term quality of life, and in these cases it is better to decide for an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer have no treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and no threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and offer a treatment in progress of the disease.
The criteria for a decision which should be treated and who not should be treated are determined with accuracy.
That is why I recommend the implementation of the test.
The most important is, however, to talk to Ar to determine whether it should be carried out or not.
In collaboration with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed a tool that is possible to evaluate the PSA test's advances and deficiencies.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonder to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of disturbing it.
It is estimated that 30% of the cancer diseases could be prevented if everyone eats good and moves sufficiently.
"If there is no smoke anymore, this value would increase at least 50%," stressed André Beaulieu, speaker of Canadian cancer society.
However, about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by inheritance.
Many also remain completely unclean.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline of the number of smokers.
The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It harms people's health strongly.
"There are still 1.5 million fuckers in Quebec," deceived the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the delay to the cigarette, the risk of cancer is reduced to die about the help.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, Adi also promotes overweight and Adi.
They seem to increase the risk of breast-, grimm-darm, mast-darm, food-, bubble-speaked and breast-feeding cancer.
"The research shows that a regular corporate A during the whole life of the crime cancer," he adds.
The Earnest
The organization also recommends limiting the food of red meat.
In too much, the risk of infection at a grimm or mast-darm cancer is increased.
It should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt can lead to the creation of cancer.
"Latests can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamine
In the past years, several partners have examined the relationship between vitamin rates and cancer.
However, your studies are now not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, vitamin E is opposed.
As a result of a decrease in the risk of prostatactic rabs, another has shown an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly shown.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of speaking with Ar about his thoughts and his pre-load.
"The implementation of an earlier identification test does not lead to cancer."
Analysed by the Higgs Boson
The announcement of the probably discovery of the Higgs-Bosons has made a certain view in the last summer, and this is for a reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is shared in nothing less than in the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And this is the last part of which the existence of the standard model - of our best or "the least false" statement of nature and behaviour of the material - has not yet been observed empirely.
But for the physicians it's not completely sure that it's really the higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new part, and that it is strongly similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, this seems to be assessed by new data presented in this week on a large physical congress in Kyoto, but there were no data to be completely safe about it.
Still, let's conclude that it is actually the Higgs, because it seems to be a little risk of disturbing, and we look at what it is about.
In this world there is a vital inappropriate law that causes two objects not to be present at the same place.
It is not possible to destroy this rule - and do not try too strong because you will be hurt.
For even if the physics is a really strange world, it is evident that it also applies a such law: the Pauli's exclusive prince, which says that two parts can't hold the same room at the same time when they are in the same "quantic state", which consists of this "status" in large and entirely of some of their properties.
From this, physicians divide the parts into two categories.
In a corner, the good citizens who are obedient to Pauli Prin.
And in other cases, the bossons, a usual band of anarchists, which are nothing -- in any case not this Prince, which means that they can actually be at the same time at the same place.
These bossons are located in two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Labors (the other is absolutely surprising): the mezons that we will not be treated here and the "power parts", through which the great powers of the nature spread and with which the Higgs-Boson would be related somehow.
But it must be pointed out here that these bossons are not all such exotic creatures as you could think.
If you are able to read this history, only thanks to a bosson of extraordinary banality: the photos or the "light parts", which is the "boot" of the electromagnetic power.
If a part with a electric load accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field will be "satured" exactly on this place, in such as a kiesel stone that has been packed in a thick.
With this "shopping" there is a electromagnetic wall (light, infrarot or Ultraviolet radiation etc.) and this wall is nothing but a photo and thus one of the bossons "Trender of power".
Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the subsection that another field, the Higgs-field, must be "shaped" to show this boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the accommodator must gain very high energy, a little comparable to a rounded tissue, whose surface could only be scared by a very large rock.
That is why a big partition accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Great Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to gain such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful again to declare the relationship between the higgs and the mass.
In fact, they are not all parts and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnete, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet paper would never hold from itself at the fridge.
And at the same time, all parts are not interacting with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass while the other (as the rest of the photos) are not massing.
For what can all these research now be "good", Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For the Community, they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicians to examine all differences between observations and the predictions of the SM.
Moreover, there are many physicians who hope that such differences will be found, since the smallest undershread opens a door to a "new physician" and can stop some layers of the model.
It must be said that the last is still a great deficiency, since there is no evidence for the gravity (ops!) and the dark material, which represents approximately 80% of the universe's material (new ups!).
However, such differences were not found until now in the CERN.
Effects
The effects of these research on the general population are more difficult to be predicted, but it would be wrong to make it not possible.
Moreover, in the early 60 ’ s, the pioneers of the Lazer have not believed that their work would be a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the destructed physician Willard Boyle - who has been in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was found in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first long-stream class (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was viewed as a "laborary player".
Imagine...
○ Applications can also be made from all instruments that enlarge research.
For example, again Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and has introduced the nobel price for physics in 2009.
Of course, this doesn't mean that the LHC A's A's will have to change our life permanently, but it means that you can never know it...
Pa'active administration - the best way to die... ○ Le Devoir
With its "Death in Würde" committee Quebec has recently discussed the heavy issue of life.
The debate must be restarted in the course of the preparation of a legislative draft.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
Le Devoir tried to see this closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in Monteregia.
The prostatactic rab, who eat him, had left him a period of two years.
"You gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half-five, in bed at the house of Paictor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived in the morning.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The illness makes their work: an unforeseen weakness prevents him from going alone to the toilet and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a beautiful breakfast, he wants to resign himself to help meet.
He can even laugh and talk to the foreigners who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bathroom.
The courage of the usual death.
"My greatest desire is to heal my course because this is humiliating," he shares.
A few hours later, the team found a medication for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we find out that a man is stucking in the stone," said Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the home Victor-Gadbois.
Return to the childhood phase is an inacceptable humility for certain people.
"It depends on the ability of the person," he makes a step back, he states.
Because, according to several persons who work in the pa'active administration, there are large events in the middle of these steps.
Patients who are placed in the home for pa-active Victor-Gadbois gadbois are all in cancer.
You have a maximum life expectation of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and sisters who care for them will no longer be overcome with such a "healing" career.
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst threat is to die "consciently and by extinction".
But by the illness, I really met my children.
"I've got kids," they're added.
"I don't have any desire in my life anymore," she says before she accepts to put her a mask that helps her to breathe.
Yet, in the next days, she expects another last one of her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home Victor Gadbois, you are offered with a group of volunteers of body managers and assistives in the advice.
The pa'active management will then be used if there are no other options.
To make the dead more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11.700 inhabitants are located in a bed for the paetive management.
This is very little when we are taking into account that we will all die on one day.
Here the life will continue under best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of He.
So at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You will ever give the dead a mouth with Brandy or Pepsy.
The diabetes should no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of every day.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
Today his son will cut off the beer at the feet of the worst.
"We help attendants and patients equally," reports Supervisory Director Nathalie Savard.
In the house of Victor Gadbois, there is no day like the other.
Besides a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well based by his headkits, while he is arrogant to his honor, a 36-year-old young man who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children in a driving way after he tried to survive everything.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been exposed to cancer patients in age of less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients in Victor Gadbois home come from their residences, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to the paediatric management
It is said that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to papperative controls, i.e. to a career that will reduce the suffering of patients if the last time they have reached the final stage of their life, both home, in the hospital or in a survey home.
And several organizations such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the company for home pa'active management in Montreal's large room are specialized more or less on the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great insufficiency in the health supply of Quebecs ensures that several doctors specialised in the Payeative administration of the derogation of a law on the regulation of death assistance and assisted suicide with disappointment.
Since the month of October, a manifest has been subjected by prominent personalities of the pa'equipments such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to announce their resistance to such a initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system Quebecs is not sufficient to ensure that all rights have the right to a high-quality papperactive management before accepting to overcome death assistance.
Recently, she says, I've seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the need without taking measures to feed them.
I am afraid that the patients want to die only because they don't get adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predicts to the last day.
The chances of survival of Helene Richard were already minimum when she canceled a compulsory chemotherapy.
When I announced my oncology that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she suffered that I opened the battle, she told her.
Yet, she told me that I was the end!
No Almighty Watch
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have requested to die thanks to the supervisory staff that it did not have this desire after their pain has been reduced by a packaging team.
However, it must be said clearly that the paefective control in the pain treatment is not absolutely potential.
After Elsie Monereau, leader of the pa'active administration of the Society of Granra's home pa'active administration of Montreal, 8% of the patients do not refer to a pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of the life, the doctors often return to the terminal sedition that is going beyond, either sporadically or permanently to the time of his death.
We can't do this anymore as if we don't understand this side of suffering.
Patients without pain bleeding will always have the opportunity to return to this terminal sedition.
Patients whose pain is not linched say the same term: "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean forcefully, "I want you to sleep me," but "I want my pain to be linched."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism stipendium of Canadian health research institutions.
Immobility candale large amounts in Quebec
Officers of the Road Building Agency, Company of Building, Financial Procurers of Political Parties and Specialists of the Italian Mafia report each day what they know about a great "system" in the building, officers, officers, officers, workers and mafiosus.
A "industrie", which was much higher for the tax payers of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system is falling since a drastic action has been taken," Jacques Duchesneau, Mr. Quebec and the former police leader of Montreal.
The scandale was discovered by him due to an incoming investigation of the demands in relation to the Travel Trade on Road Building in Quebec, which was only accepted by the former Prime Minister.
The Duchesneau Report established a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and dealing with officers.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he emphasises, "the Department had solely divided a billion to the contracts" because some of them were inclining their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission " has already fallen into two citizens" added, in the hope that she can show the tactics behind individuals.
A 2011 Called, Permanent Anticorruption Unit
The 2011 called, permanent anti-corruption unit also takes great efforts with its groups of economic investigators, investigators, and analystes of the Government.
○ the police of the "Marteau Group", which since 2009 has resulted in the "Canalisation Cartle" of Montreal in the artificial breathing of the contracts...
In the past weeks, she has taken house investigations and accusations for fraud and corruption against municipal mandaters such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the citizen of a city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just returned from the office as a citizen of Laval, the largest city of Quebec.
He is suspicious that it has repeatedly accepted Smith money in exchange of public contracts.
Moreover, the Engineers of the Road Building of Montreal were expressly accused, as well as Italian originators, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lastly, he has made a view by explaining to the Commission the functionality of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He himself has paid for several years 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Master Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has had his hand in the game in the 2000s by giving more than 88,000 Canadians (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincies, especially to the Liberals at that time.
He also agreed to have organised an illegal funding for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalisation contracts which have been expensed artificially by it
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked freely.
The former building engineer Gilles surprenant has expressly described this before the Commission: in the years, he received from the building company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tours, restaurants and Eishockey games, as well as the costs of compensation in the amount of 6.000 to the contrary to the canalisation contracts which he artistically replaced.
Other officials of the Road Building Agency have admitted that they have been smiling by refreshing the accounts with false additional services artificially by 30-40%.
○ a prosecutor of the citizen's party, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay, has accused that he has probably looked at a shadow household, who has fed his casses with black money.
As a result of these enthings, Mr Tremblay returned to the beginning of November, which increased Montreal in a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal who killed the alarm.
As a citizen of Rivière-des-Priries, in the east of the island, she refused to sold a community base for 5 million and continued for 1.6 million builders in the tremendous immobility.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation last carried out, she says that it is "at a fade that allows it to understand the function of the system invasive by milk to stop the evil and to blame the guilty".
She says that the procedure is " painful, but positive".
However, we are about to clean the wounds, we need only one specific investigation unit for Montreal, and a view to prevent a return of the valuable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau recalls, on his side, that "Officers have stolen several hundreds of millions," but especially thinks about the role of the "Mandadrowers who are in the picture" if they weren't injured!
From a share of 70% black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he claims: "I was told that this is only a weak decree of reality."
The Government of Quebecs proposes to restrict the S° to the parties to 100°, which would not change the situation: "When the elections are not strictly limited, black money will be in the course."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall deeper; by being courageous, we can rebuild the house on a stronger basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international view of Quebecs and those of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh about to throw a corner into their own backhouse...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have adopted a new measure with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it by a personal view, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day, I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements urge me daily to improve my game level.
And in a game this is even easier.
Everything's going very quick in the football.
But I'm not breaking up in an amazing.
Since my beginning in the centre of the preparing training of the INF to my game time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress gradually.
So you use the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accessories of this summer are used to play very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is exhaustive.
This leads to a player like me, who has to offer the stars and wants to give his own.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me much about my game position.
It is supported by co-trainers as a Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti includes respect for all technicians.
Ligue 1 has no comparable person currently, and it counts the best trainers of Europe.
He looks back to a rich experience and has won many titles with viewed units.
He had contact with big players.
I think he's gonna win another title in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting conversation with him.
At that time, I just got from a series of hurt.
The confidence he has placed in me is also a claim for my services.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the shipmaster.
But we're in the back.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: in this way we have qualified ourselves for the eightfinal.
What is the aim of the union in this competition?
We will try to come as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to join our roots against a lot of communities.
To this end, we want to be the first of our group before Porto so that we can deal with the return of the 8-final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a big unit in short view?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a larger unit, Paris title must win and make a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG provides the funds to adopt concrete forms.
Would it be a big misfortune to not win the title in the Ligue 1 as this was in the last season of the case?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really have the heart to deal with this title.
We were close at the last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to deal with the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We ended with 79 points.
Normally, you should be master with 79 points...
But another mention, those from Montpellier, has achieved a more better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even when the large crowds like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux run the title, I think we have enough to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that many of us are expected.
We accept this perfectly.
However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can forget us, it's something frustrating with security.
You're wondering what the people still expect.
We could never win every week with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A man's building up with time.
In the Champions League, we have proved strength.
Look at Manchester City, a unit of two seasons has not been able to improve its quality for the 8th final, and he has also activated great deals!
With regard to the invested sums, you believed you in the game pause with 15 points forward!
It said that our enemies and the French mastership would be left without respect.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good at the last season, were "bound by this new PSG".
This shows that the ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope we will be the laughing winners in May and tell us that we have won them despite all difficulties.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So better you're talking about a Zlatan dependence.
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and proved that he was the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he played, he brought the eyes that he was a great player and a world star.
Inside the community, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defendants worldwide, also allows all others to make progress.
How did you learn the EM 2012 with the French nationality?
Like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to be shared in this EM.
Unfortunately, my damage prevented me from expiring a little game time.
I've seen things from which I've been strengthened.
Today, I can perform games in the national community.
This was since my baptism with my "Bleus" hope.
From what happened in Ukraine, we have learned, and today we have to put an example of behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has reached many promised results.
We have a position in the qualification group for the WM.
The National Tra is strike, is close to the players and is right to win.
As was Laurent Bla.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Bla has achieved his goal by being qualified for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is this an undetermined game in Spain on October 16?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has been used for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never learned a comparable game in my kare.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between participants.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is acceptable: the conviction that the current system of elections made by bank monopolies leads to financial crisis.
In fact, it is a bitcoin found by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) both a wave (but in, euro, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent that allows direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been taken.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as spending or as payment.
After the Bitcoin course in June 2011 reached a maximum level of 30€ (23 euros), he fell to 2 months later before he recovered to around ≥ ≥ today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing especially impressive in comparison with the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the most successful choice", "in competition with or euro" and "as the common currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of currencies such as the "Credits" used to advance in a video game that can be won or buyed by games (and sometimes replaced).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
However, the trade will be controlled and controlled by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time containers of the account book, checkers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users finds actually between two e-mail addresses in the form of a mail location.
With the subsection that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction shall be signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the processed bitcoins are available in the accountbook of the public accounts broadcast on the entire network.
The decision-making step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is about a mathematical task starting on computers, whereas the winner, which is a type of temporary central bankier, is the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a screening of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a smaller and clearly electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number to her before the whole is "shaped".
The goal is to find the number that produces a special fingerprint (much zero at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can check if it is the right.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any change would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay two times very quickly (lower than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions from the network would be validated and the other remains unlinked, because both different fingerprints have been printed.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this recompense will be semi-formed, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins are therefore limited to 21 million, but are shared up to a hundred million million, which allows a certain game room...
Furthermore, the difficulty of the task will be increased with any improvement of the accounting performance.
The lives of the network have already been high and deep.
The web pages provided for Bitcoin services were attacked and shot the Bitcoin installations.
"The useful weakness office doesn't refer to the protocol," assurances Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports the possibilities of the money waste using this anonymous service.
However, Bard also shows this lack.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse S.
Others such as the WordPress blog platform are accepted.
Recently, Adi Sha and Dorit Ron from the Wizmann Institute in Israel analysed the account book and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in the course.
In November a "Mega-Slussback" was launched.
"Treenty thousand have been replaced," Jon Holmquist, who for the company Coinabul, converts the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this wall, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or an uncontakt payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are more balanced.
Furthermore, the inhibitor manages his integrity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented in the traders, and the last must not install new terminals or computer programs.
You must just specify one address that can be "fotographed and recognised" by a phone, Peter Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to oversee hierarchy systems for strong horizontally oriented systems.
"There will take some time until Bitcoin takes place, but it could be a turnpoint in 2013," he prognozes.
In addition, in its report, the ECB proposes to re-evaluate the different risks considered today in the case of a success of this bill.
We're gone from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghanistan Army will take the possession of its territory again, and that the Afghanistan people will decide their future without expecting everything from us.
We have particularly punished the Afghanistan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves killed with our 88 soldiers, as well as the damage and losers.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders, who are at Pakistan, but often also from farmers who reject an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their hundreds of years and archaeological traditions, even though they have joined them as Chshihadists, Pakistan, Arabs, Usbekens and Tadschikens.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local residents, the last will not be there when the west countries become discrete.
The refusal of the French troops from the support point in Nijrab, which I observed by a hill covered by a mandel tree, financed by French credits.
The cargo and panzer convois overflown by hubs have reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will no longer be a stream of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since its inconsistent premary from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was over the battles of the various rebellious groups.
Your power overtake was then viewed as a kind of freedom and back to security.
The Afghanistan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the overwhelming farmers of the Al-Qaida Organization, but their situation has not improved until today.
Earlier Mudschaheddin, Afghanistan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinated position.
The main personalities of the antisoviet war have come back to the power in 2001.
They have transformed themselves into business managers by taking the government's bases to build them to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefiting from the massive sub-contract trade.
They were committed, and most of them were not part of the fights themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not combined from debt.
Youths want to leave the country as those who were able to use the applications of the Ananias: the capital flight is significant.
The young people have set war and his ideology.
With their exil money in Iran or Pakistan, they have contacted the modern world and have enjoyed their benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are filled with girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurance of the single parties or to the corruption of certain drive forces will be required to provide jobs.
All, including the weapons, are occupied by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, representing a modern world, will be viewed everywhere.
A army is now available.
Will the authorities under which they will be commanded be considered legally?
Earlier commanders of the antisoviet fight are already trying to restore the milisions in the province, which will be removed from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong locality, should have benefited from a certain decentralisation in the western N°, but by repealing the Office of the Minister, which was since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized state with a strong presidence.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the case of the walls scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 50s and long ago.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional steelworks are not available and important evaluation systems have not been reparated.
Everything is imported; except fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given the priority.
In a country based on wars for 30 years, it would have been necessary to control the infrastructure.
The extent was spread that Afghanistan had large earthquarters.
This also strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only in place to strengthen it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper from the place, or without transport means for export over the mountains, it is not possible to build mountains.
The Chinese have almost left the coppers of Mes Aynak, allowing international architects (financed by the World Bank) to make their excavations on the large Buddhist towns and remain the main employees of the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is largely dependent on imports and exports, will also be necessary to restore normal relations.
The refusal of the French fighting groups was completed on 20 November.
The new Co-operation Treaty provides the continuation of traditional aids: girls and youthgymnasia, French Institute at universities, French institution, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support of the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Defense Minister (Cimic), which has been established in 2012, has been carried out in thousands of mountains, many useful works and measures for the sanation of agriculture, and has allowed a small French non-governmental organization to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aid and open action.
These works that were needed for many local workers have been able to undermine the rebellion: pregnancy, sources, drinking waters, rebuilding, fruit trees, ground protection and increased agricultural uses.
What subvenir do we leave after military expenditure of two billion euros?
A much more modesty budget will contribute to the improvement of the local conditions of life, which often are higher than 2000 meters in these valleys.
In the news, there are thousands of scriptural questions of small agricultural farms of communities of the province of Capisa.
In order to free farmers from the rebellion conducted by foreign groups, which is their own wishes, the continuation would require less, well-controlled and directly relevant civil aid to their benefits.
A Constitution with the breachstone in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi.
As regards the constitutional claim, which temporarily gives him the unlimited full power, more than ever split, he decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise all of them, he announced at the midweek that the Constitutional congregation will be adopted by its final replacement on the next day.
Just a week ago, the overseer of the State had granted this plenary two months later for the end of his work.
Egypt has now been on a provisor, multi-modified text for almost two years, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal transition.
This new initiative has only provided a further share in the country.
For his adversaries, the President endures "autocratic delirium" by "breaking his word" and "the right of the feet".
On its sides, it is more assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referencendum should be maintained within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to delay on their foreign, to declare the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the Presidents, it is also a way to restore its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is in the whole country.
After confirmations in an interview with the Weekview Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will be prompted to vote.
At the same time, the Egyptian people with this return to a overlooked vote will be put to an Ultimate: "It's a vote for my draft, or I'll keep the unlimited full power," the latter, after the adoption of the Constitution, should be completed.
85 most of the islamic members of this Constitutional assembly have precluded the text last night in a rare atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals did not follow the request.
Shortly before the constitutional claim in the middle of November, they have dismissed, because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views to the divorce.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to reach decisionability, there were 11 persons, representatives of the members, assigned to each morning.
Some are very close to the Moslem brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles have been unanimous.
In addition, the commentators felt amazing that the only difference in view of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, since some members of the Greece thought that the penetration of the Constitutional congregation was not exactly.
The text that has been forwarded last night consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 which took all attention remains identical to that of the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The salafist parties for which the creation of the Islamic Law was a major requirement had the hope of replacer "the principles" by "the rules", which would have made a striking application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a evidence of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Scheinness" replies to the liberals that view this as a propaganda decree.
Because they follow the islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.
In particular, they have recognised a advising function in the eye of Article 220 of the University of Al-Azhar, especially in respect of the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Soène Pommier, this is difficult because "the persons invited to a opinion have not been chosen and no democratic legitimity.
In this you can see the first signs of the theocracy."
The prohibitions of the Liberals are also added to the fact that the next director of this University is much less satisfied than the current.
"There is now not to recognize a specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the citizen State.
The majority of the jurists who have been in this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," Alexis Blueet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian Constitutional Transition.
However, he agrees, "that can be a majority in respect of Article 220, since the terms used are rejected to the religious chain.
This is particularly regarding the "Fiqh" [Islamic legal statement, Anm. Red].
And in the future, the question could be opened in which civil judges are competent to decide."
Furthermore, religious aspects are criticized strongly because of the extensive powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Moslem brothers claim that these comparisons with the former regime are clearly reduced.
Another conflict point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil procedures in military courts, as required by the associations to defend human rights.
The finals also share their promises regarding the text which they view as a threat to freedom.
The reality of blasphemy will be maintained, and facilitations are now prohibited, which might have serious effects on the right to free opinion, especially for the press.
Furthermore, there is no article on the protection of women, highlighting Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
Your opinion is the only positive point the prohibition of the folters by article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
As the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstration was planned for this afternoon.
The officers of the Government's head will be marched on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the Nabel of the world and a sea from the sun
The Promised Land units the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an unconcerned nature.
The AIF calls you the five main reasons for an eye in Israel.
Refuge from the Holy Places
Visit the Flood Jordan in which Jesus was baptized.
It means that everyone who prayed in this stream receives God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his wonders: the turn of water in wine on a wedding festival, the go on the water, the silence of the sea storm and the fish.
Once here, Jesus appears to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuaries are located in Jerusalem.
Believes are here walking the path of suffering or crossway of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman Festival Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the roads of the old city to the grave church on Mount Golgotha, where there is the cross place, the salted stone and the grave of Jesus.
Here is, according to the Christian opinion of the Nabel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The closter of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is at the place where a Christian legend according to the tree grew from which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus ’ cross.
In Jerusalem, there is also the most place of the Jews, the claims, the rest of a temple that the Romans had been held in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, there people of various religious directions leave notes with desires that then go to inheritance.
Take a travel to the height
The ruins of the Festival of Massada constitute the rest of the secret hidden from enemies that built the Great Herod in 25 C.E. for his family.
They lie on a rock wall in the mountains in 450 meters high above the sea level.
Only mountain streams can get the ruins from their own power.
Everyone else brings a air trail to this historical gipfel.
In the north of the country, in 1600 to 2040 meters height is the famous ski area Hermon, where it goes into the winter months, increasing tourists.
From the foot of the mountain, you get there with a shuttle bus.
The skips have a total length of 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, gentlemen lived in the mountains.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Only one road can not be visited all of them.
However, at least the five most interesting of them should be refunded.
Below it is the Israeli Museum near the Knesset (Parlament).
There are stored old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in Felshollen in the Jewish wilderness, as well as about 500 thousand archeological and anthropological exposures.
The Museum of Art in Tel A is also valuable.
There the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is published.
In Akko you can visit the Museum in Bad Al Basha, which offers several rooms of old Turkish bathrooms with sculptures of the modern buyers and bathrooms.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ra• Museum where you can be amazed by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenir members.
The entry is free, and S’ is fundamentally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel A日, told one of the most exciting chapters of the history.
The most attractive department is the memory for children that was built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When the room comes, there is full darkness.
The star function.
And the names of the Jewish children and the lands where they died are revealed.
The Ukraine is also in the area.
Do Something for Health
The three most important areas of Israel's recovery are located on the surfaces of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places, there are pools, water parks, delfinary and oceanary.
Surprisingly, in the Red Sea, the winter months are also built because the water temperature falls not under 21 °C and the air is heated up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is built over the whole year.
On the other hand, this unusual sea with a position of 417 metres under the sea level is the deepest sea of the world.
His turkis blue water has a high salt content and thus brings it even unswimmingly difficult on the surface.
The landscape around is undescriptively beautiful.
There are treatments of salt water (natural salt salt) and healing lamps and treatment of skin infections, allergies, asthma, exhibitions, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and strapaciated nerves.
To touch the secrets of the older person
These secrets offer the old town of Tel A, namely the city of Jaffa at the Mediterranean Coast.
By this city, the famous seaway, Egypt, Others, Anatolia and Mesopotamies was connected.
The city is invoked in ancient Greek and al-Egyptian legends.
According to deliveries, Noah built his architect right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists are pleased to blame through the heavy gates named by star signs.
Fortuna will be the legend after all who touch the walls in the gate with its stars.
In Jaffa, you can meet newly conceived couples from all Israel and even other countries at photo terms.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strike through the Roman theater and obtain the strength of the cross riders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of Romans, including Pontius Pilate.
In carefully restored theaters are recorded today's evening concerts and operas.
List of flags for tourists
When you go to Israel, you don't worry about your bad English knowledge: about 30% of Israel speak Russian.
The money in the travel should be taken into no euros, but in it that can simply be changed into shocks (current exchange rate: 1gt to 3.8 shekels).
In the city, you are going forward with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a straightway and in Haifa the only U-Bahn line of the country with six Sts, which connects the undertown to the top town.
It is exactly a underground station.
A driving inside the city costs, independent of the feeding material, 6 shekels, which includes enough crossing for a road from up to 1.5 hours.
According to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath will be held in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday to Sunday, markets and businesses have been closed, and the public department rests.
And on Sunday morning the week starts.
In many cafés, restaurants and guests, there is only cooking food, which excludes sugar meat, sea products, fish without shops and food containing milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different courts with hair and coffee meat, suppes and desserts (to be prepared with cocotic milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sosses, frictioned balls of picked bones and herbs (fals) and fruits and fruits.
There are no streaming dogs in the streets of Israel's cities.
For this, there are many well-feeded cats that stretch in the streets.
On the evening, you see them sleeping on the cooks of parking cars.
The cats like beaten places and don't say no to leckery.
A cotton costs each day between 37° per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188° (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs 15° per day.
And railway delivery costs 15 shekels per day.
Income cards for Museum cost in the range of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all Israel visited.
Most adventure and recovery seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came into the promised country, which corresponds to the comparative period in 2010 with 51% increase before the derogation of the vice obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
Deputy members and citizen judges discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already acting with older certificates
Yearly, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Sankt Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tadschikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to deserve money for the entertainment of families residing in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force, according to which each worker immigrator needs to submit a test confirming the knowledge of the Russian language.
This scheme is too applicable only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the public housing economy and in the individual trade.
However, the tests with time will be to be obligation to all guest workers according to the federal migration associates.
This is not only the language tests, but also the Russian history tests and the bases of legislation.
Language knowledge must be demonstrated both for the maintenance and for the extension of the employment authorisation.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where the Russian office is.
At the same time, those who received their training and diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are excluded from this law.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the research institutions will be under the Egide of the Puschkin Institute for the Russian, the Russian University of the People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburger State University and other Russian High Schools.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; now in Russia, more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened.
The initiative to implement tests was supported by the Members of the State duma and the Federal Migration Participant.
However, before the entry into force of the law, citizens' rights asked several times the following question: What is the whole?
What changes brings the rule to show language knowledge, both for Russia and for guest workers?
In particular, in contrast with the migrant speakers, it is to decrease the number of forced workers.
"Multium speak now about the protection of the rights of work immigrants," says the leader of the representation of the Federal Migration Participants in Tadschikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be suspended before they are denied.
Only a organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
The migrants had a problem without profession, education, language knowledge, and their appreciation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will be encountered foretold people with bad intentions that put him under the prevention of help in a dark, heavy baracke, where he will endure with thousands of his similar months without food and documents and will be created 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the house you will proclaim this, and at the arrival you will be encouraged, get their steps and don't receive the promised wage," the leader of the main administration of work migration of the Tahistic migration members, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't shimp, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics, who want to deserve their money in Russia, allow not only to control the language of the target country, but also to be unwritable in their own language.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as the evil: only few tourists, usbekens and tadchicks can be a reasonable education.
Because in their families there is no money yet to feed the children but to buy them anxious clothes, shoes and school cases.
As a teenager, these children take the first opportunity to deserve money at the same time.
"It's difficult without language knowledge," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and less valuable."
Citizens' rights show the following important aspects in relation to the law.
The test must only be removed by migrants with legal status.
If you don't have this status, there is no test and therefore no of the work.
The majority of the guest workers continues to remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Disbound access for unlectives"
Migrants assured that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is official hardships and, of course, the language difficulties.
○ Legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand Rubel.
An elderly registration can be made quickly and only for a half thousand.
The workers of the Russian police know that our documents are most old and we are not registered, and then there are cases of pressure.
"You want one or two hundred rubels for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Don't solve costs for wrong papers"
Just on the day in which the law entered into force, it was evident that not only the registration documents of the migrants could be older.
Some elderly certificates confirming the validation of the language test have already been affected by the federal migration staff.
The oldest papers were printed with a usual color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive this otherwise: each migrant who hoped to save the tests as such paid for the document seven thousand rubels.
This is more than double as the costs for the official test: this costs a work migrator three thousand rubels.
In order to not simply cover the certificates, both officials and citizens agree that the main direct task is to deal with the system before corruption.
For the moment, guest workers who first fall through the test can only promise that they receive time for a language base rate.
In addition, newcommunications will be offered without language knowledge to bodies in areas where there is no active consciousness with people.
Internal Ministry ignores illegal weapons
A percentage of legal weapons in criminal offences very small
The Russian Internal Ministry provides a decrease of the weapons law for private weapons owners.
In this way, the authorities react to the latest events: damage in shooting at wedding and seven dead at the Moscow jurist Dmitri Winogradow.
The police wants to prohibit the weapons of non-mortal weapons in the public and to reduce the age for the possession of shooting weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal supported the President of the Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised the amendments to the Law of Army in Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to cope with the problems with the "promotion of the shoes".
On the Internet, a open letter was published that the representatives of various weapons - requested by the authorities to take distance from "sensitive distortions".
The crime of registered weapons is very low, expressed by the criminal judge, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian BBC service.
According to the Statistics of the Ministry of Internal Ministry, 142 crimes were committed during six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand delegates were exposed for the same period.
The officers of the open letter are convinced that a distortion of the law for private weapons owners of crime will not stop using it on the black.
Currently, you can find the manufacturers in Moscow every possible weapons for a little money.
The Internal Ministry emphasises that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Manufacturers: from the manufactures to the officers
The weapons are over several channels on the black.
There are five such main channels, explained by an earlier Colonel Viktor Baranez, who was active in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a web page that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons that were stealed during the battle in the Kaukasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Kaukassians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons that will be stealed by criminals.
Baranez states that there are weapons that have been stolen from both the police's weapons and directly by criminal persecutors.
Other illegal armed weapons come from military weapons.
In many military stocks, explosions often occurred.
"There are evidence that in some cases, it was brand funding to interfere with the lack of weapons," says the former military citizen.
According to Baranez, a contribution to black was also provided by the weapons producers.
"Today there are a number of private stakeholders that do not hold the international competition and therefore spread the weapons under the hands of the black, such as in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of black is the shoe.
Many weapons and weapons come from poor countries like Kirgisistan.
"There is a own, sometimes handful production and a mafia that organizes the smuggle," states the former military citizen.
Where's the weapons coming from?
Experts calculated the percentage of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report from the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration was reported.
Experts analysed reports of the Internal Ministry and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Crimeological Library and public accessible data on the subject of weapons.
The major part of the illegal weapons comes from the army and the legal protectors.
The helps of all weapons on the black are therein by the "shopping of responsibles who have reached their work with weapons", says the report.
According to the data of researchers, 17% of the weapons from conflict areas, 14% are returned to the depth of weapons production, and 5% result from illegal extracts.
A soldier of a weapon that doesn't want to be called namely assures that weapons that are found in illegal extracts have been buying nobody longer since they are older.
According to him, it is more often that the traders take care of the back in a weapons store.
A weapon, for example a gun of type TT, is bought over a farm.
The weapon is issued and transferred by the pool.
"The trader brings the weapons into the city and puts it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he said
"The police, of course, knows everything and thus leads to the unable to comply with the plan of detection of crime, periodically control buying for trademakers to offer illegal weapons," the sales added.
"Luxury Load"
Buyers and sellers most often find one another known.
I had looked at web pages and blogs when someone was looking at me and suggested to come to the "Begowaia" station where a person would wait for me, who brought me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I first learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To take a weapon, I need a known person who has contacts," said the seller. "I have such a known, but I don't trust him."
There are traders on the markets, but there you need to go and take a code as "of Ivan Iwan Iwanovitsch, which allows the daughter to lose a teeth".
I'm even coming to some shocking on a known person I trust.
He also gives me the sticks because he knows that I don't hurt him.
Newlingers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military citizen Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he wrote a article on this subject.
The schemes have not changed.
He received a photo album in which "all possibles" were drawn.
"I felt like in the luxeload," mentioned the military citizen.
The buyer says Baranez doesn't get the cat in the sack, but can test everything.
I, as a potential customer, buy not just, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we'll negotiate each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Buy out of the sofa
Internet search machines show search results for web pages and groups in "contacts", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
There are no papers needed or personal meetings.
"You only need the amount of money," it says in the advertising indicator on the web page "Buy campaigns or weapons".
There users set up your commands and ask questions.
Is it too increasing at minority?
"Surely without license," users ask "Iwan" (normal quotation).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," the Laconic Question of "Fedorenkow".
The Fédéral Security Service recently switched many skin web pages, and purchasers who wanted to purchase the weapons went to the network.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and land then in Siberia and can look at coal
Military commentator and former military citizen Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered in the foreign, and Russian laws are not applied.
The responsibility shall adopt the orders.
The purchaseer is transferring the money on a bank car.
"When he answers, he receives a photo and description of the hiding of the weapons," reports the press speaker of the useful organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitri Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you can go out to the end and get back grids if you place a request on a website.
The Fédéral Security Service recently switched many skin web pages, and purchasers who wanted to purchase the weapons went to the network.
"The people come like hungry fish in the feeding and then countries in the Syrian lake and can look at coal," he says.
A Makarow for $100
In purchasing illegal shooting weapons, experts are expected to calculate prices from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislow from the organization "Pravo to oryzhie" you can buy a gun from the type Makarow for 100 to 300.
You have to wait until a half months.
The weapons are issued in military weapons by overseers in the middle borders.
According to the official statistics of the Internal Ministry, the number of delegates with illegal weapons throughout Russia returned by 7% to 22.9.000 during the period January to October 2011, while the number of discovered cases of steel and pressure related to weapons, munitions, sprays and sprinkle equipment was decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fixed food and super employees
Each fourth American youth is sitting behind the Mc Donald's box
In the past days, there were massive protests in the United States against low salaries of Walmart and Restaurants popular fixed food cats such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kent’ky Fried Chickens.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to swallow, or if they are going back to the air.
Protests are supported by tools and several links-oriented organizations.
In addition to the creation of modesty salaries of simple Walmart and Fast Food employees, the Protest's organizations follow the goal of establishing tools.
This sector of the economy has not been organized yet.
46 cents per year?
The Protests started last week after thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where they found sales in the United States, millions of customers have been able to make hands.
On that day, some Walmart collaborators, of whom there is 2,2 million worldwide, put their work low and determined together with tools and left activists of the chat, whose target group is low and average income.
Walmart purchases all products, from windels over jackwear and car batteries to dust, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is in the middle of 8 to 27% more favorable than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the lowly paid Walmart employees purchased only in their own workplace.
The prices and the product classification made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart is often able to increase the product only because the employees are badly paid.
Latests also complain about severe working conditions, such as lack of tape stapler or hand scanner.
The participants of the Protest requested payments on "Black Friday" and expressed their difficulties that the contribution to the operating hospital insurance was taken from 30 to 100° per month.
A typical Walmart worker who deserves $9.5 for the hour could not be able to give up this increase, they said.
Scientists from the Californian University in Berkeley show that if the company increases the average payment to 12°, it would cost 3,2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than they are now for payment.
If Walmart had completely put the payments on the customers, each purchasing costed it in future only 46 cents.
This would be a year for them in comparison with today's additional expenditure of 12.39.
For more Walmart, it is satisfied that only in nine federal states it has come to protests and they have no loss to the company.
The Black Friday stayed in his load from 8 hours evening on Thursday to midnight, and in this period Walmart purchased approximately 5000 articles per second.
In total, Walmart Cases conducted almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The speaker of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-hand Huffington Post that in total "lower than five" Walmart workers and the protesting action was only "only a PR-Trick" of the community organized by the Protest.
"Free Kasse!"
The protesters continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart branches (which are not desired in this progressive city and are therefore inexistent) but were McDonald's and other precious restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company has billion portions, and yet you are not given a hospital day, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New Yorker City Council
Currently, the minimum wage is in accordance with the Federal and New Yorker legislation at 7.25日 the hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum loan will be paid after and after, but not too strong, and in the average their simple workers in New York will get the hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this dark city.
As it is possible to get out of New York with so little money, it's inappropriate to me.
There was one time when almost a quarter of all American youths after school stood at McDonald's behind the theke, but the young people lived with their parents.
Someone saw the main income source or plant in it to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews, I am met with McDonald's workers who are constantly complaining that they have to come out with this wage and sometimes even eat their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum whose officer notes that it is unresponsibility to get children if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests who started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's 40th street and in Madison Avenue, requested that the casiers and kitchen of fast food restaurants receive a minimum loan of 15 US dollars for the hour, which corresponds to more than a duplication of the current minimum loan.
They continued to ask for the education of facilities in the fixed food branch.
The US law prohibits the management of the business to stand in the way of this goal and to refuse or delay the members of the company.
On the other hand, business management does not make it easy for them.
The creation of facilities in the fixed feed branch is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high personal fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were also many other fixed food restaurants in Manhattan on that day.
The high point of the Protest was a congregation in the midnight before McDonald's at Times Square, in which some local democrates spoke, including the town Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says that it is billion portions, and yet there are no hospital days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrants were also supported by other prominent New Yorker democrates, for example, by the citizen's candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "We should share the fast-food partners together so that they could receive a righteous reward and achieve the economic welfare that each New Yorker deserves!"
According to New York Times, this was the biggest action of their kind in the history of the American Fast Food Industrie.
However, only a few hundred people were on the front of the place, from which all were not employed in the fixed food bread, where they worked ten thousands in New York.
It is not yet to determine whether the functions of these protests will mobilize the whole mass.
"The brain can only overlist moderately"
The theme of the enlarged reality popular in modern technology is recently considered usually by the lens of a special brilliant.
First, Google presented a working model at his annual conference in the summer, then in November, that Microsoft had also reported a suitable patent.
However, in talking to the leader of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft Lab in Cambri日 Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the brilliant for the company's owners was only a station of processing.
It encourages the possibility of manipulating objects in the air with only hands and creating free areas.
- Please describe quickly what research your group performed.
- We work with the interaction of humans and machines, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
To this end, the humanity is mostly staying in the phase, in which pixels are locked on flash images, which are sometimes affected.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and to predict the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the kinect sensors are a progress, and today there will be no Xbox locked out without kinect, since everyone is interested in movement control.
What else is expected in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things are still playing on the flash image, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, not yet decided.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional representative systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world in our physical world and make them more fascinable.
However, it is necessary not only to be recognised by the user but also its environment.
Then we could add the real world much easier through objects.
And first of all, we should leave these protected Virtual Reality Halls!
- What do you think of language control?
She's nice, but will she not be overvalued?
- It's certainly not the solution to the advance, because it asks questions about it, because you do not always want to inform all those who are on the basis of its actions and intentions.
In fact, every kind of interaction with computers is good, but everyone in their specific neck.
For example, in the field of control of objects on public places, we have experienced a project with short and buttons, rather than with outloading gestures.
The gestures were not opened by the object camera, but by a armband that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically can be decreased to the size of a armband hole.
However, in general, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as ethnic and language.
- How is that?
- Would we, for example, ask me to give you this syringe dose?
They say it, and they say it at the same time.
- Normally, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can offer at the time and what doesn't?
- No, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we need to work on the development of new sensor types that enable people to understand more accurately.
For example, this can be laser sensors, since they offer a solution in the depth, which is very important.
- What suggestions do you put out of your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is it missing resolution, deepness or something else?
- The present generation is in fact a good starting point for our work in the field of three dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels would not be bad with a speed of 1000 fps.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of matrix and depth.
This is how all the current technologies are not good enough for us, since the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the resolution at the X and Y, but also at the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per seconds are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps are too few for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our lab in Redmond with a regular processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, while today’s commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
For my work, I needed exactly a preparation, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be added?
- Kinect → Currently with three "cameras", one of them is a infrared and the second is a recipient for the reflected signal.
And the camera is actually a usual RGB camera.
It does not serve for the depth of the objects.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, because there would be more demands.
It would be nice to be a flexible, kinect-like system that we could play with different cameras to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
- If I remember right, Microsoft has not presented his brilliant public in contrast to Google.
Do you not think that, as regards the application of the technology of extended reality, the brilliant has the best views every day?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to keep a phone in the high hand, but I think the following: the greatest variant would be an "switching" reality in which we could switch over a cloud from the brilliant to the artphone,
The brille is a personal Gadget and there is its strength (privates can only see), but at the same time their weakness, because an extensive reality through brilliantness prevents you to work together with others on ability.
- Let's imagine a moment that the manipulation of holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man but also a normal death.
There is a problem that often indicates the criticism of this idea: There is no sensible reaction!
The hands don't see anything!
What answers do your group want to give to this invasion?
- In my readings, I often say that the extensive reality represents the seventh breakout of interaction between humans and machines.
I think the eighth interruption could be the integration of taktil observation.
A interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unusual projection base.
She takes the pressure greatly true!
However, there are also technologies that are actually designed to provide "images in the air" some hands, for example, the interference of some urged ultrashall radials in a specific point where the finger is, a feeling that is still so weak than someone put on the handballs.
There are also bands for the handheld that affect the nerve extensions in the fingers, that is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to list the brain?
It's thinking that it's worth what it should appreciate when it's just seen something?
- That's a idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to fight for a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room, believes that he is in a open, practically infinite room; here we work on concepts with running bands (other than in fitness studies), moved platforms and big balls.
To this end, the brain can only be modestly overlisted, and there are still many working years before us.
This makes the work in the area of reality for a researcher so attractive: in many subjects we are first at the beginning.
Private smack place Culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburger Avantgarde" project, which is designed by the people of the city, which forms the avantgard of art and culture.
On the reading list, high-range representatives of the Petersburger Artsschene have already landed, whose success is over the borders of the city and often finds recognition in Europe, without being in Russia.
The new herd of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kiril Miller.
The whole city knows Kiril Miller, who is dressed in red gardens, who are once at the Russian museum, once at the summer garden, once at the scene trees or on the destruction cases.
Wherever the pictures of Kiril Miller are also published, they are locking large human masses.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburger-social-losophic artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a lighting personality of Petersburger Avantgarde end of the 80s or beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and envyed by his presence on the street a lake in the face of his fellow citizens and takes care of them for the Laune.
Recently, he stuck a triangle and became Petersburger Triangle Player, since he finally felt ready for this difficult role in his artist, his philosophy and his image.
- Kiril, why are you always in red, not for example in yellow or Turkish in the city?
I have chosen the color Red as designer, which is separated with the optical and image.
In this world it is the red of the compromise between artists, image advisers and society.
In the society, everything that differs from the grey standard, aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to come to communicate with people through my provokation.
Each of my past provok was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painting?
- On an exhibition in the Newski Cultural Palace, where my work was exposed.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized paintings ended at that time, and new and free pains like me were incomprehensible.
I was friendly with the paintings of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", from which "Puschkinskaja 10", and then it was only a close.
I'm going to the theater, to it, to music, to everything, except literature.
And all this agreed in the Art-Clinic... - I was important to stand at the centre of Petersburger culture where the best creating artists should be gathered.
In 1995, I placed a room in Puschkinskaja 10, where there was a musical-artist club for the Boheme, the house of Petersburger Boheme.
There they were born: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Snur came there with the "Ucho Van Goga" project.
Snur and his friends sing simple li for playback, wearing hard tricotes, and they belonged to the modern composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play alive, it became her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great car, but he learned the foundations with us.
Even the "D 137" gallery or the "Griboedov" club have its origin in the art clinic.
Our workers and staff guests went there.
I am a hero of the past centuries, when culture was still meaning something.
In 2000, there was an investigation in the press in which the expression "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the year", and I was attended at the high point.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without providing a cultural contribution.
- Your jobs have an incompatible style.
- My pictures are real perles and clearly bring up the modernity and strength of thinking.
I'll have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are untimeless.
Before I was social, but now it is painful and ready to be like this.
In a clown, it clears everything and loses his tragic.
I love the Great, and I have great ideas.
For example, let us save the world by predicting that everyone has complete clothing.
Now, everyone looks at the clothes and is oriented on the outside and not inside the human.
But you may not be able to give a man the hand, but it should be in his face.
The whistling disappears by clothing.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the City Triangle Player.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, careful and funny.
We'll see the crowds of cultures.
Earlier, the people formed great groups: the Bohemians loved the One and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to enjoy all.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that likes everyone.
Now you need to think about who you'll like.
Now every collt star has about 100 attachments.
- Stas Michailow's occurrences, but there are thousands!
- Women left to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, thus there are less management, money, and everything is based on.
I have an attachment, and the most important thing is not to hurt them and not to hurt the achievement.
In my youth, I have drawn such pictures that even in a collector with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come at the end of the car.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumption.
The consumption has no culture at all, that's something very different.
I am a man of the past culture and I grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to draw.
That's the culture I used for.
Kiril, what does Petersburg miss?
- Good culture expert.
They say, "Cultural servants."
But not everyone of them can consider culture.
It was different in the true sacks, because the sacks may not understand much of culture, but they realized that the right experts needed.
There are currently advisers in Moscow.
We have some experts in Petersburg, but they will be locked because there are needs of higher experts who evaluate the first and free their way.
Now it's just the same funny.
The same applies to Erarta, but with the subdivision, they honestly say that they do not all accept modern art and have to search for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural headquarters; in Moscow there is much more culture and a suitable neighborhood.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural neighborhood, for example, we have more writers than readers, and this is not right.
In Europe there are many interesting people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Art must be again modern as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed from the city of Sankt Petersburg
Birth in the World Hall
The earth is in.
Heating or conjunction with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of Ra’chiffes with earth’s residents on board are searching for a replacement plane.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can continue in the injury or on the replacement plane?
I don't think there are choice options.
De facto there are only two real planets that we could at least be hypothetic.
"It is Mars and Venus," says the Scientist of the Astronomical Starberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, when the conditions on Mars are compared to lifefriendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible in large height or in the cycle of Venus, so in all,
The question of promotion in all the researchers were discussed in respect of the Flora.
Almost a half centuries ago, experiments with pfs were carried out.
The fourth generation of the inherited in orbits did not distinguish in the least of the earthly species.
It followed the disorder of insects, more accurately of winning flights (Drosoʹla), in the orbit.
In 1979, Watchtowers were sent to the world to explore how the insecurity affects the development of Em ́os.
It develops a completely normal kitchen.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the kitchen must be held; it must be able to stand on his feet and start moving," states the Laboratory Institute for Medical-biological Problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without a fixed underground, the kitchens were overwhelmed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn declined completely.
The kitchens did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they just died.
"Double times we let kitchens go and put the whole up, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Wladimir Sychew holds the failing experiment with the kitchens at all.
The last bruit coffee with animals went 16 years ago into the orbit.
The experiments will be continued in early 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will only be equal species.
There was a experiment with rats that have already been sent to all.
The principle was not found in this regard.
"It was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and research must be continued," Wladimir Sychew noted.
After landing, the space rates were grown up.
The problem of promotion directly in the space could not be solved until now.
The task is hard.
Animals that are scattered out of their natural living room can simply not follow their continuation operation.
In contrast to animals, the human could be the principle.
The homosexuality is able to abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not conducted from ethical considerations.
But women have fled to All for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk in Tereschkowa.
The most valuable that mankind is is the female organism.
Our mouths flew from it, and no one on earth could answer the following question: does it overcome the worldwide flight?
Will they be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"No one answered this question," says Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after his world space flight, the first female cosmon, Valentina Tereschkowa, was born a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was two times in the orbit and even worked outside the room vehicle, was born a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We only have very few cosmonautes, where everything went well after long flights, and they got healthy growth.
"It's more, more years older than it's in flights to the orbit," concluded Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, the Herd of the Soviet Union and the Herd of Russian Federation.
Yet, mankind must look for new ways in the bio-, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravitation.
The hydrolabor in the preparation of cosmonautes is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here, in a swimming condition, the Cosmonaute Routine won for work in the open world.
The water represents the insufficiency.
Even if awakened water feels pleasant, it is a strange environment; but kids feel water as natural element.
It's as if the small Ichtyanders testify that life in the country has gone to the Ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the kidney of the mother in the springwater, and that it can be easier to water.
In Prince, it is logical, since from birth to first swimming just once 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says Marina Aksenowa.
Worrying for a newborn child, then, the immorality is a much more natural condition, the woman does not appear without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the muscular muscle is very quickly back and thus decreases the ability to express the child.
All right, we're going to handle this through a newborn aid.
For example, the birth may also be located in a special room to print the child.
"But what's then?", says the insignificant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also has a artificial severity.
Without feeling the earthquake, organism can't educate the scalet and muscles.
A newborn child can not be stepped in the orbit like a wake up to training in a charge.
He will simply fail what is more important for his life.
"This experiment, which we do together, is the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to a barrier to bring a perfectly unadaptated people into the world," says the leader of the Bioethic Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
Until now, the birth of children in the world is just the theory.
At some time, however, it will be reality when the earth’s residents in their ra's chiefs turn to a remote planet, which will be the house for their offspring in all the birth of their descendants.
NCU Chief: Control of the black system denied by debts of the
The Czech Republic shall, however, fall in its application in connection with public contracts on control institutions and appropriate laws.
In the conversation for Actually.cz says dies der Vize President des Highsten Control Amtes (The Highest Control Authority, NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be correctly applied - and this is not the case in us," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar results also appear to be a common control through Czech and German tests.
As a negative example of practice, he directs the position of Prime Minister Petr Netid to sog.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the undertaking with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, then it cannot simply come to the Governing Chairman, and the Office of Control, whose obligation is now to control the compliance of the law, is to prevent its activity," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control of the Chambers, you talked about a common Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries relating to public contracts were compared.
What did you do?
This is a parallel examination that we have started about two years ago.
Simplifiedly, it is that the legislation determines how public contracts are to be maintained, and then the national legislation builds up, and there is still the practical application.
We have compared all these things together, and even though the test is not completed, we could find extremely interesting subdivisions.
In order to ensure that it is not enough to rebuild new and more precise rules, it is also necessary to consider the application of the law.
How can the project be a help for you? What do you do from this project?
Soon such a common control could help us to stop trying to perfect the laws and the deterioration and deterioration of weight values, if this appears to be not a particularly positive effect.
Economy means to buy a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and exclude illegal settlement or criminal action.
However, the reduction of deficiency values for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Maybe it is even so that we load the system in this way only with a excessive "paper frame" and those who are looking for flashes in the system have essentially easier to use the system than if the weight values remain.
They are talking about the problems of practical implementation of the Czech trade law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here like our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As regards the authorities, the German pen is to the NKU of the Federal Chaff, which is similar to us and is also designed by a college that is just a different form, but the same work is basically the same.
Furthermore, the competences are comparable to a certain measure, but Germany is a Federal State, i.e. that these accountants also exist in the individual federal countries - in which the German system is different from our.
The BRH can only control federal resources which correspond to our state funds.
Public funds governed by the areas and communities are under control of the country's headquarters.
What about the German legislation is it easier than ours?
In general, I would simply compare this without specific information, and I would often consider Germany as an example, but it is absolutely not possible to say that Germany is better at all.
Is that likely that the tests are better there?
This is certainly not, but as it is said, I don't like such comparisons.
It is still noted that those countries who are an example for us also have to face problems.
Otherwise, they would not have anything about a cooperation with our authority, right?
As regards the Czech legislation, what was the importance of the renewation of the law, do you have any effects for your authority?
In view of the fact that this Novelle is in force for a short time, it has not yet been affected in our tests.
Since our controls are delayed, there is a certain delay to be considered here.
The effects of the future monitoring phase of future controls, so we have introduced the new control instrument "Acknowledgement of the risks of economicity" and with this approximately 14,000 public orders, will be considered and analysed - here the changes will certainly be effected because the changes of the values of the conditions for certain kinds of claims have been modifyed, etc.
Do you see the distortion of this law more positive, or will the system be charged with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step towards the right direction and hopes that this adoption will be active.
However, the problem may be that the rules will be "intender" and cannot be kept anymore.
In line with the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination against the trainer (e.g. in the case of a operational programme of the Regional Policy, the Regional Council) are competent that any non-compliance with the provisional law is equal to a violation of the budgetary disclosure.
But is it meaningful to make the law still stronger?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and misuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form of error that does not affect the decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
Let's say one time, which way is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not be able to celebrate the undertaking with controls of the "swarm system" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited legally, it is not simply possible to come to the president of the Government, and the control office, whose obligation is now to control the compliance of the law, can be prevented in his activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing would be.
The provisions law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain procedures - and this is also appropriate for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the offerer is excluded with the best boat only due to the form of errors.
The Law will never be perfect, but it must be correctly applied - and that is what we think is missing.
On the streets, ice is simplified, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of Czechland, there are parts of snow and ice cream.
However, the roads are greatly guided, in the middle of a higher perspective.
Karlsbad
In the district Karlsbad, the streets were well driven tomorrow, simplified snow and ice cream.
The temperatures are decreased to -5 to -10 °C, it will be a bit warmer over the day.
In the region, it is no longer cut off, and in the deepest heights there is only a dark snow.
However, on the stairs of the spring is about 30 cm snow.
According to the surroundings of the street guard, the view was limited because of the clouds.
The strategy R6 and the paths of the first road class in the region are currently unlimitable.
However, the attention is offered on the bridges on which the roads are below and glazing.
At the same time, all the ways of the second and strict road class, the mountain roads, are able.
However, on these roads, the snowest remains separately or exited.
In addition to the layers, there is therefore increased attention.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads of the East Bohmen, there is a snowshot on the streets downside because of iron, in low positions and in the mountains, the road and car road direction are shared on their websites.
The road mechanisms warn the driver from iron, which may occur particularly in a position in the Pardubice district.
In particular, it can come to ice because of the second and strict road class in the Circles Lanschkroun, Usti nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Myto.
The streets I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are treated chemically.
Snow is especially on the streets in the Riesenberg and in the mountains of Orlische hory.
A snowshot is located in high places on the roads of the Rychnov circuit over kneel and Trutnov.
In the east trees, it is largely solar or hot today, and it remains largely low.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, weighting a weak wind.
Circle pilsen
The streets in the area of the pilses are well able today, but locally, a higher attention is offered, and the way is to adapt the weather.
This is comfortable tomorrow, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees under the frozen point.
Since it has snippet before and the temperatures have then fallen, it can come to the streets of iron.
Moreover, it is local to be calculated with clouds, but the view will be improved in the daily past.
This information comes from the streets of the street.
The car D5 is practically unlimitable, but increased attention was recommended between the 80s and the 13m.
The railways of the first road class are mainly dried, but frozen.
However, in the south of the circles of pilses and Tachov, it can be secured by iron.
The roadways of the second and strict road class are feasible, and therefore the reference to possible sections applies here.
The drivers should be especially careful for the less frequent roads in the area of Bohmerwald.
Territory of Olomo
Today, with snowmatically, the drivers who are on the road towards the high places in the district of Olomo.
After the use of stream vehicles, there remains sneematically on the pass of Chervenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlsky cross.
Nightly the snowscreen forced the road walls to use, in the circle of Shumperk, according to road management information, about 3 cm newsnee.
In the other areas of the area, roads are most unlimitable.
"In the circle of Shumperk remains in the highest layers.
On the pass of Chervenohorské sedlo, the drivers must consider Jesenic with snowmatically," said a worker of the street management Schumperk today against the CTC Agency.
Also their colleagues in the Jesenic Circle had to come out the night, according to their information, the roads to the high places after chemical treatment are free and narrow.
In the Olomo Circle, the streets are unlimitable, but in the Starnberk Circle, the drivers must take care of the driving areas of the woods, since the roads are still stuck here.
Territory of the Osti on Labem, Liberec
In the North Booms, the streets are also reporting a number of bad-leaving streets.
Besides several places with snow or ice cream, the mountain street from Telnice to Knínice is locked in the circle Usti n.K. according to the information of the police.
The temperatures also remain in deeper positions under zero so that snow and ice will be held on the streets. From the deep levels, especially south of the Bohemian Mediterranean, there are no problems, and the streets are usually dry there.
There have not been reported any transactions until now.
Iceglätte is reported in particular from the circuit of Štětí.
According to the information of meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this night - daily over rain and snow, in the night of cloudless heavens and Frost.
The main streets and street I/13 at the border of the districts Usti n.L. and Liberec are reported bad conditions.
The street sphere between Telnice and Knínice was required due to easts that were used from the snowload to the road.
Simon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think you should find place in less than one month of the world's department?
This is one of the catastrophes that we like to start people so much.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make us rather fun and say that we are the only band of the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's outcome.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world's decline.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a country-wide benefit event that we have planned for two years.
For this purpose, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end has been prognozed for 21 December at 11:10 tomorrow.
On the day before, e.g. on 20 December, from 21:00 at the same time, three concerts are located in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concert will be in about the time that the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a period of 12 hours before us.
Who's this idea?
Originally from me, then we made the idea together with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We want not only to collect sufficient energy to prevent the world's decline, but we also want to think together with the public about the situation in which we give this world once to our children.
On the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key attachments against the world's decline, with which the purchase on www.e-tap.cz can also be subjected to us.
The band The Tap Tap has also included the sog. Hymne against the world's degree with the title "World Down" with other interpreters.
Today, the hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will it also be found on the benefit concerts?
Of course, and even in the end, provided that everything is crazy and the world's outcome doesn't be able to...
The hymne will be sing by all interprets on all three concerts at the same time.
○ the hymns together will be live in a direct shift from the Czech television.
The text of the hymne is from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sing with...
How did you come to cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultures, which involves that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to intensify these people into our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in a cooperation with us, and they have a pleasure in it.
What is the purpose of the redemption of the concerts against the world’s decline?
For the establishment of the Bar-free Education room Studeo, where we have been working with the United Tap in the Jedlikka Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlikka Institute are regularly deserved by lectors who help them at different times of freedom.
Since the students themselves don't have the means to visit the lectors, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlikka Institute, it will be a own building in which we will then enter the project.
At each concert, several groups and interpreters are present.
What criteria have you chosen these?
We wanted to set up a program that corresponds to all Geners.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Learn more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Have similar "great events" also been planned for the future?
In May, we'll start on the first time at Prager Frühling, and we also prepare a interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year, we would like to take place in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - this would also like to connect to events in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small until you have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group combined from people with disorders.
How do you order these travels logistic and organising?
It's not so bad as it appears on the first corner.
Five of our members are roll steel carriers, i.e. the roll chairs must be transported in the pack room. Of course, we need to drag a lot of instruments and other packs...
Unfortunately, it has always been covered without problems, CSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I have sometimes been partly surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign travels, you have a comparison of how it looks in the individual countries with the freedom of bars, and how to go around there with defeated people, etc.
How have you learned these things until now?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other cities where everything works better than us, we were just witnesses in Russia that everything is still in the East.
In contrast to Prag, Moscow is absolutely unrestricted. It is still unusual when someone in the Roll chair is in the town's room.
It is not even clear that, for example, a role carrier is in the motion.
Fortunately, there are also Verene who are trying to refer to the problems of people with disorders.
And in what way do we need to draw up the further developed countries?
There's a lot more in which we're hanging back...
However, it is still noted that the improvement of the situation is still dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely usually that people who have severe obstacles can move themselves in the public room, go to museum, use toilet, etc.
But it is not just usually that there is a larger group of preventive people actively shared in social events, in which we are a little forward with the band The Tap Tap to the West!
Respect in the public and freedom of bar is one thing, but only when our series of significant sporters, artists, players, actors or advocates, things will really begin to change.
This is only individual cases of particularly desired personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very .. but when we go back a few years: What have you motivated in 1998 to create a band?
At that time, I started as a manager at the Jedlikka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in working with something intense.
And since I'm a musician and I'm a saxophone player, I've created a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with the time it is how our Moderator, Ladda Angelovič, will say, something without control.
But the band was known only in the last years, or am I missing?
It is true that cooperation with singers has helped us, and we have also started to be active for us.
We have become conscious that if you let something and not see this outside, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU's forward money, we can also provide actors, high-quality devices, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it to the Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning I've seen the potential that you can take things differently.
In showbusiness, one of the other is often copied today.
This is logical in his way, since everything new looks at and is accepted only after longer time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I weigh to claim that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the viewer has most is, of course, compassion; it is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely overflowing because people with obstacles are not unique and abandoned beings that we must suffer.
There are people who can live a complete life and develop, if they have the necessary means.
I always say that if people with disturbances do something, this is not just a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict leader, how to hear of many people?
If you want to do something good, you can not enter into many things, and you must also require a certain disclosure.
This is my opinion, but it's totally normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and then when they find that they have two times the week's sample, they have to resolve preparation phases and spent a lot of time on concert travels, then the enjoyment of many is quick.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently the Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of these have been from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lady Angelovich.
We're a open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and has the pleasure to join is always welcome to us.
Find place on the day before the prognozed world department, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynoim/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three event sites are connected to the end by life-scale and it deals with a common interpretation of the hymne "Weltdown falls out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The objective of the concert is to provide the funds for the compensation of a multifunctional preventive educational area to be found under the name STUDEO at the Jedlikka Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available in the pre-shop in Bohemiatic.
Poland and the world.
Last week, Poland was taken into a Ministerial Council meeting of the European World Space Organization ESA as the twenty-first member of this world-wide member, which is therefore the second Member State from the former East Block (after Czechland, which was member of ESA-Mitglied on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland to the world room was freely started much earlier.
Before World War II, Poland cosmosbeasts were occupied with the space travel, and they were not always understood by understanding.
I, for example, recall the report of A. Sternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warschauer Observatory, where the author had thought of his pioneer work "Entering to Cosmon".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the auditors cold, and after years, Starnfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown his interest in his work.
Shernfeld won the Price REP-Hirsch founded by Robert Esnault Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "Entering to Kosovo".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major defensor of the astronomy and the roadway.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disclosures.
Gadomski's globally recognised contribution to the development of the space travel was, inter alia, appreciated by the nomination of one of the craters on the exposed side of the moon after him.
Just in 1925, a race-drisine was built in Poland, for which a race-out was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this stage remained unknown.
It is not even claimed whether the racket should be used to start or breaming the draice.
This information is exhausted from the modern press.
In 1933, the Poland infantery began to consider with rackets.
Research work was conducted by the Institute Techniki Mountains in collaboration with Professor Miečislaw Wolfke and Professor Gustav Mokrickiegi.
From the documents provided, it is evident that the research was conducted up to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then freely interrupted by the introduction of German warmness.
In 1937, in the Fachpress of Ing. Rohoziński, the design of a photoelectric jagdrake was opened, and in the next year the work "Racieta - torpeda poōna i raketobomba lotticz" of the author Leliwa-Kriwoblocky.
Both projects covered the military use of the racket offer.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of the racket technology were coordinated by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, his work was completed from the beginning of war.
More articles on the road will be held after war thanks to the work of the Poland Space Society (Polonia Astronautique) in the Poland press.
The first exhibition of this company was held in the 1954 issue of November The issue of the issue of the issue of the problem, in which four extensive articles of the road were listed.
The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a spatial company.
At the time, there were already the first projects for satellite technology, and it was to determine that the research of the Worldra would have the future.
At its beginning in 1956, the Poland Space Society PTA tried to join the 1951-based international federation, and actually the PTA was a regular member in 1956.
In the following year, the first PTA president, Kazimet Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was a representative of the International Federation for Space.
This office had been in 1959 until death.
Since 1956, the PTA participated essentially in the development of the extreme orological raquet (Racieta Meteorologicczna), the first Poland racket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start was held on 10 October 1958.
The racket with a maximum flight of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and was not totally 5 kg.
Later, a improved version of RM-1A was built, and 1959 Flight Tests started in the wilderness of Bugdów with the two-degrees RM-2.
The racket was 1,4 m long and weighted about 11,5 kg.
Another development level should already be able to make real scientific work - the rakete RM-34 should have a flight from up to 14,5 km and to be used for the monitoring of high winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was established.
Following the first rackets of the type RM, the meteor-1 racket was developed in the 1962 to 1965.
The rakete was able to be two-degrees, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this racket, which distinguished from each other in the size of the transport ra for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rackets are available through a transport room with 0.4 liter fixing capacity, meteor-1B exceeding 0.34 litres and meteo-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flights were 37 km at all three types.
In the 1965 to 1968, the Meeor-2 racket was developed in the Air Carrier Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a use load of 10 kg at a height of approximately 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
In 1960, the Polish accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) followed two years later the establishment of a national CoSPAR Committee.
Poland also participated in the worldwide research with Soviet satellites under the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Poland Pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski, following the Czech Republic Vladimir, became second intercosemonaut.
The derogation of the Law on useful work is not a solution.
In the last week, the Constitutional Court adopted the law on useful works.
This decision was open to a vital debate in the public.
It is definitely interesting to view the problem once from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
Finally, this means that individual economys are in a permanent conflict.
This is why the principle of the free trade and the free, unlimited movement of the capital which is in hand with a free financial speech.
As a result of the large subsequences of the value of work (loans) the prices are stressed.
In this term, a situation in which the manufacturer is trying to exist by importing profitable goods in the economic competition is to be understood by "the competition" in order to make a greater market share in itself and to increase its profit.
In a large manner, this means to the majority of enterprises transfer their production to the foreign, or to purchase their business, but to leave their business, which is a high unemployment in countries with comparable high jobs.
Since the capital does not have social responsibility and thus does not have a responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, the State expenditure should be increased.
This situation is still strengthened by the fact that the undertaking ladies are absolutely unnecessary to charge their taxes and thus replace the common economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is general, so specific statistics are overflow at this point.
The unrespectable practice of the capital creates in individual economy a situation in which the governments are forced to join competition in order to reduce the social level of their own population artificially and thus to lock foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments offer their own population without regard to the social consequences of the capital.
This is particularly expressed in the amendments to the laws applicable.
The objective of these measures is to force the population to accept the capital dictate, in particular in the field of salary.
This is an economic force for long-term unemployment, for others through the circumcision of workers' rights.
The results are growing poverty, and even greater differences between arm and kingdom.
In Germany, for some years there are public food taxations for arms that are not able to eat themselves by their own work.
The number of those concerned already goes into the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it is regularly possible that workers receive such a low wage that the State must extinguish their income until the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of aid forces employed in the German Bundesday.
In practice all EU southern countries will, of course, go out to the same situation where people are forced to migrate (as was in the 19th century) under pressure of a disastrous disturbance of their social level, or to work for a hunger recompense in the area of the society and to hope that any private investment capital will flow into the country.
This is naturally the question of how this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty turns from one country to another; or the capital remains at the same time, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Marokko, Egypt, or Africa, the employees work for a breakdown of the loans.
This is about the whole Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the State is not able to share capital in its own economy and that the economy leads to economic catastrophe.
The capital holds appeal to the position that the State cannot be able to intervene in the economy.
But then, you must ask yourself whether the capital does not affect it and thus affect the whole State in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically all powerful lobby in all countries.
The result is a disadvantaged situation in the field of corruption, mutual advancement, legislation, in which practically everything is straffable, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a State Ministry has lack of private financials, close to the industrial legal undertakings with the processing of legislative drafts.
These legislative drafts will then be decreased on the Bundesday.
All violence is then no longer out of the people, as the Western Constitutions are declared, but from strong financial groups who are interested in their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracy was currently quickly in a situation as Appian in the Crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeius: "The State has already been understood in the disaster for a long time, and the enemies have been occupied with violence.
In the case of the mixture, by immoral distortion of advantages or with stone and weight.
The corruption grew unhealthy, and the people went with already covered voices to choice" ... "The people with characters didn't fight themselves, so that the state had no consule for eight months after this decline" ... "The only medicine in this severe situation had to be a single ruler, and that a strong man had to be chosen"... Appian thought to Pompeius, but the strong man was then, the Caesar, who replaced the democracy permanently by the single rulership.
As it is shown, today's society is based as in the ancient times on the undeserved preference of its own benefit, without taking account of community interests.
The capital is already not able from its nature to recognize and implement the benefit of the whole society.
The result today as at the same time is an exampleless decadence of elites who do not strive to deeply reform.
We therefore need to look for the cause of the fascism and communism in the unrespected liberalisation of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's state, the decline of this regime for liberal democracy can be considered a certain pause in which the next department is already delayed.
Besides the catastrophe, today's elite is the fact that the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnesses, as well as the crimes against mankind, as we know them from the older and newer history, are in perfect ignorance.
The removal of the Law on useful works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent solution.
Under the pressure of the global and economic competition, the Czech Republic will also be forced to continue searching ways to press the population's social level below.
This trend is therefore systematic.
The only solution is political-social reforms aimed at increased capital participation of the State in the economy, to increase the impact of citizens on the government and to weak the monopopulation of capital in the society for the state.
Israel: Work of Chaos.
"...that nothing comes from violence, or could ever come," Sting sangs in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...as we don't forget how disgraceful we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there's no," says the dead gutel Snaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wall of violence between Israel and the Gaza stream, there was, as always, a number of reactions.
They stand behind Israel and argue with his right to self-defense, while they deal with the Palestinians as terrorists; others again submit the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israelian State, with the murder of the peoples of Palestinian Arabs and with the state of Israel as a terrorist.
I do not want to write to this place about who in these continuing whales of the murderer and who is the victim; finally, the people of Israel today of the self-administration territory were born in the current political situation and they did not have the beginning of violence.
I am concerned to open the readers the corner behind the kitchens, whose 95 years of spending (recognised by the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are in the small flexible country in the Near East, especially.
My thoughts are partly on accessible stories, others are leading from these, and come from my own understanding of who or who of the people has significantly affected the events of the modern history.
The history of mankind is in the first place a story of the fight about power.
At any time, we can make an Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less evident is the question whether it was really always these personalities themselves that determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was a person behind his throne who declined their actions to an appropriate goal.
We must realize that we live in a time where the world’s wealth can be in hands of less individuals, and that this concurrence of money and its outstanding power has not occurred within the lives of a generation.
Under these astronomically astronomical families, a particularly highlighting that you might be able to face as the head of the crack (I don't know whether anybody is over them, but I don't close this) - the roths.
It is not written about them.
It's understanding.
The first Press Agency (Rerês) has already been covered by the Rothschild in the 90s of the 19th century to join its name with higher criminal acts, in the background of which they always have strengthened, increased their power or both.
The Roth Schilds are shared in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries where they are not shared in the central banks, they lead to wars or struggle to them (before the overcome of Afghanistan, there were seven countries, after overcoming the Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the Sturz Ghaddafis, only four, while Russia was submitted to his central bank of the Russian Government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family had to live with it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, started during the civil war, own (speak: State) banknotes and was killed in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy started to issue their own banknotes and wanted to reject the FED - he was killed in 1963; Mr. Louis McFadden was deteriorated in 1936 after he wanted to complain the FED for the exhaustion of the world economy crisis in 1929.
In the 1859 - 1871, the global power coasts of the Rothschild led to the formulation of a plan for the destruction of three world wars by Albert Pik, a free waller of 33th, and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the large monarchist state of Europe, in particular by the second war, the Colonial Government of the United Kingdom should be broken, and the war was to reduce the world’s population to approximately 0,5 - 1 billion people (a number of such would provide for their pleasures and Luxus and would also not consume so many resources), to create a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the preliminary) and to lead to the overtake of the absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families with the red skids on the top is the solution of a crisis and the next boat of a solution (order of chao - order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that the crisis as they were resolved in 1907)
After the murder of the Habsburger Thronguer Ferdinand in Sarajevo had been able to solve the First World War, they deeply held the Russian Zarenarian through the revolution of the Bolschewikens.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economically unbased capitalation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zarenary, the war was no longer necessary), then the resolution of the Mediterranean Great power of Austria and Hungary.
In order to simplify the Second World War, the banks have made a delayed conflict situation by establishing Germany with gigantic war reparation; thus they have cut down the conditions of poor masses, so that they have only needed to subjugate the Germans only to a quite strong leader named the guilty and simple solutions; another was the creation of the country of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that should take the function of a fifth column and also accepted to simplify the war fire.
In the end of the 19th century, the Roth Schilder initiated the creation of the sionist movement at which a branch tried to establish a Jewish country, as possible, in the history of Judah with Jerusalem as a capital city (Rück® to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was first coherent with the inhabited Arabic population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War, and if Hitler is now loss from the chat, in which the international bankers had first held him, or whether everything was in line with the plan, it is only difficult to appreciate, in any case the suffering of Jews in the concurrence camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as the war repairs had been prepared against Germany for the Second World War, the call of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
When the international banks are able to determine this war, the Jewish people will be similar to the second World War in the first fight, this time with the Arabic or Muslim population of the Near East.
Israel is like a great lab, a source of fight and chaos, not only in the country itself but also in the international (remember only how the people will share themselves in the enemies and enemies of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where iniquity is only in an infinite spiral of violence, and at the beginning, the strife of individuals and their efforts were for global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel have to choose the same as with us, the people, except their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascism attacking international banks, who makes everything in order to deal with a war with the Iran, which, in view of the membership of Iran in the Shanghaiian Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly extend to a global conflict, and it could, because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles broad road of Hormus, which would be more than 20% of the world's economy.
In which light the words of David Rockfellers from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is a wholesome crisis, and people will welcome the new world rule."
In their imagination, the new world rule is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the human population serves a small group of financial architectures.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip to undermine this being of the total control.
"And it makes the little and the big, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign to their right hand or to their heart that no one can buy or buy, then he has the pain, name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: whoever has understanding, let him consider the number of the animal.
For it is a number of men, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The Argo movie: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a demonstrating islamic student mob introduced the US news in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as a cousin.
For their release, they requested the delivery of the broken shahs Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was after the revolution in the United States, who had kept the patronate over his regime over a year.
For the Government of the Ananias, there was no positive outcome from this situation - she could not allow herself to throw the look over the board, since this would have caused a massive prejudice to the confidence of their associates in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to implement the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime, in Iran, the release of the oils.
It was a severe shock for the call of the United States, and the next Fiasko attempt to make it worse.
The arrested diplomats were released after 444 days after negotiation by the Algerian Government.
The shicking salon of the iceals called home a wall of solidarity and anti-irian votes.
The debate in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan to the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the Regissor and Watch Player Ben Affleck describes a episode of this story, which protected the United States a small partway.
Just before the posting of the message, six news workers were running the flight.
This ended after numerous complexities in the residence of the Canadian messenger.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, it was possible to bring refugees out of Iran, thus helping them a extravagant story to cover their reality - they traveled with Canadian steps as members of a film stab, which seemed to be visited in the country Trihort for a science-fiction film.
Combination of Genres
The plan developed by the "Exfiltration Expert", Tony Mendez, also made Hollywood's cooperation necessary.
In order to believe that the tension has been identified, the articles on this film project in expert magazines were held, press conferences were held, and the ficticial production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The movie reflects the reminders of Tony Mendez.
Abfleck's movie is a special combination of several film genres.
On one side, he is a realistic polythriller, but at the same time also a sog. "Caper movie", i.e. the story of a gained householder piece, such as the film of Ocean's eleven.
This changes the voting levels in the movie - on one side the documents from Teheran (in the title sequence, iconic modern photographs are shown, and there are also no large subsections in the film summary of the same situations).
On the other hand, the most locked passports from Hollywood, which are ironic and easily overlaped, so.
And then there are still the scenes from the central and other institutions - men in contact with the meeting table, on the offices, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has achieved a notable restart of his kare with this movie.
From a observed shower, he has become a respectable leader, and he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his game movie after Krimi No child game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without G日 (2010).
At the same time, it's the first film that does not play in the home boston of the rider.
The track for the atmosphere of the place was the characteristics that removed the previous films from Hollywood's standard.
However, Affleck also shows this track in Argo, where Teheran of Canada is "played".
The best scenes of the film are playing in the streets and showing the reconstruction of events that really have found place - the input sequence of the eradication of the message is very impressive in their oversight, yet it provides the feeling of confusion and in previsibility that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Similar effects result in deflection with team also in physical scenes (the wrong film stab on a base in Teheran).
Too much action at too many places
The leader also had to deal with that the story offers not many stressing scenes in the film sense.
With the small, however, he is right, while he sometimes helps the reality - which does not always act so elegantly (the scenes where the threatening crisis on the aircraft in Teheran is turned away from a telephone in America, or also the persecution year on the start travel, act something).
The weakness of Argo is his too wide strike, which is conditional by the need to show too much on action at many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood collaborators, but their figures had deserved more space, and so they are not alone in the movie.
It is a movie that can be pursued with a certain interest, using the design and the retro-style recording to a 70-year-old trigger.
However, he is just awakening.
However, as a reminder of a lifestyle story and as a evidence of how much the ideas of all the powerful and all-knowing secret services are, it is sufficient.
Directives for the surface of airballons, bananas and circles
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who calls for an annual survey on the most absurd bank taxes, has decided this year to comply with the competition "After Regulation or Idee from the EU workplace".
"On this idea, the EU's recently submitted plan to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of big firms," Patrik Nacher, who cares for the organization of this investigation, said against the magazine Pravo.
In the nominated absurdities, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the Union of Insurance Tarifs for Men and Women.
Even so, women enjoy a benefit in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Incredible incidences from the EU workplace can be nominated until the end of this year.
The vote will then take place until the end of February 2013", divided the following.
The contrary EU Regulations include the commitment of bioethanol to fuel that results in natural damage, the prohibition of reliable check silver thermometers only because they contain a relatively small quantity of this ingredient, or the Directive on the size of eggs, which was essentially more deteriorated in this year.
In the past, criticism also concluded that the actual prohibition of the use of the term "butter-up" or the prohibition of sale for original glasses.
Bananes must be 14 cm long
The EU facility often decides under the pressure of this or the lobby from trade and industry, which, in general, will be represented by one or more Member States (e.g., Czech Republic is currently trying to implement the requests of the Czech banks with Veto.
Lobby's interests were also the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and cannot be shown "creaming anomalia".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonised the ununional national standards that would prevent trade.
The standards relating to fruit and vegetables have already been emphasized by the EU against the opposition of some countries, indicating that the current directives would lead to a pollution of food.
A candidate for the winning in this survey may be the EU Regulation of the past year, which, in accordance with airballons, must be determined in order to indicate that children under eight years are not able to broke the airball without a grown.
The EU has been aware of an ananas, which, according to airballons, is the leading cause of the death of children.
Similar restriction is already applied for children to 14 years in the use of years.
Curiose incidences are also home
Relatively absurd is also a directive relating to the own officials - everyone who takes an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of Greece's topic, and it must be said that FYROM (former Yugoslavia of ○a).
The Bankopoplatky.com server nominated in collaboration with the Library Economys Laissez Faire in addition to the EU Regulation on the size of food proposals in a Member State.
Thus, the EU defined the high volume of food proposals that would be located on the day of our EU accession in the area of the Czech Republic.
Czechland then exceeds, for example, the fixed volume for wallet-conserves, which threatened us with a high money penalty.
The inquiry organisations were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money to have no sea or the idea of payment for payment requests.
These ideas were freely not from Brusel, but from Prague.
"We are accused that we have no sea.
We will be replaced by the EU," the former Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ChSSD) said in the midst of 2004.
As a argument, he pointed out that the cereal was very high and that the State camps were overwhelmed due to such intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to maritime ports, the EU should, according to Palas, take hundreds of millions of euros to us.
The European Commission found the Czech Republic as far as it organized a claim on the acquisition of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea.
Supports for payment requests offered to the Communities the Ministry of Regional Development under Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU), which should be specifically involved in the establishment of funds to Brussels.
EU: More strange rules are the exception
However, regulations will be easily deserved in the Member States for the objective of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also for the efficacy and development of the entire European Union, according to the opinion of some experts.
A seriouser problem, as these experts think, is the EU's forward money for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of the integration, but which has been forced in the financial negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also call on the fact that Czech Republic is like other Member States in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although Czech Republic could defend the name "Olomoucké tvarvánky" after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, whose tradition returned to us until the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename to "Tuzmake".
The name of Rum shall only be used for products of sugar distillate, not for products of sugar tubes.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, in the society of the worldly famous category Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Mar ́ans or the parmasching, the Karlsbader Twiback, pohorelic and Trèboň, or the Saazer Hops.
With a EU mark, the pardubic lebcooke or the horicer role can be broken.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how is it possible to be candidated to the President's office?
I don't want to be a Senator or a president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would never candidate anywhere.
But I can't see how the Republic has been planned for 20 years, how the debts run freely, while people's taxes and pensions are added.
I had no ambitions to become more.
But if I see something that I don't like, then I'm trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40, and I'm independent and partially, I have no other way to influence things than to candidate to the office of a Senator or of the President.
In the Senate you did it and then made you on the road to the village.
Don't you turn your choices back?
I told me all the time I would take the battle around the village after the result of the senat wallets.
Later, I did this and said that I would be candidate to the Office of the President if I was chosen to be a Senator.
But my goal is not the function, but the function is a tool that I can make my visions.
For this, I need a lot of influence and a strongest mandate.
But the difficulty is not only that we shimp as people in the neighborhood and in front of the television, but let everyone who wants to change something down.
To this end, the media that want to raise the honour to one and who turn the freedom of the word to lie with freedom.
For example, I was claimed that I would buy journalists or that I was adviser of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The battle around the village you have taken with the thees of the material and criminal obligation of Others and with reverse resource colors over 20 million crowns.
That is why you have to change the laws.
As the President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate can introduce legislative proposals as a whole.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I used the leader to remain a free movement, and this could be done.
The problem is the little spiritistic . - when someone comes from the right or left with a good proposal, it is probably rejected, and that is only the population that stops.
As independent parties, I have a greater potential to gain support to all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take the best for our country without shoes and partidogues from each party.
Do you look like a man in the right or left?
From the Czech view, I seem to be seen by people at the left.
For me, this right-links thinking is totally insignificant.
For me, it is important that we continue.
I am not concerned whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect the people.
I always submit every good solution approach, even if it comes from the KSCHM or the ODS, and I will also turn back against bad ideas.
You're missing when someone gets you as a popular.
But don't you try this by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And this is what you want to draw close to.
This can be considered as a popularism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken are already functioning in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you have only a sign.
And that's why you're not coming long-termly.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people enough, you will be able, for example, to implement the material and criminal debt?
I don't have any other chance.
to convince, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side to implement these objectives.
As the President, I would not be a problem to invite the presidents of the parliamentary parties on television in order to legally enhance the material and criminal liability for the employees, the judges and the state advocates.
And the speech should then say why they deny this.
A strong personality that refers to disasters can exercise pressure on the political scenes.
Only once take the direct choice of the President, which was a service for public pressure.
I'm clear that I am an amateur; I'm neither a genius nor a intellectual.
I'm trying to find associates for my views and visions.
I just started and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to evaluate the things myself; and if it doesn't happen, I will return to the sector in six years.
It sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saver.
I know that I don't get anything alone; therefore I have spoken with several personalities about whether they would not even like to candidate for the senate.
For example, I spoke with Radim Jančura, who refused to carry out work.
I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in trade with easily oil.
I started my candidature with the condition that people are deeply unfaithful, but now I'm no longer sure.
Seventy pro of the electoral rights have not been taken to the elections, and most of those who have passed have chosen representatives of the Establishment.
We're just two independents in the senate.
The people have chosen such a settlement that changes will only be very difficult to continue.
Yet, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct choice of citizens and vice-presidents.
Do you think about the establishment of a party?
I have not yet followed this because I have no time to check the past of each potential member of the party, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the president's campaign; on my transparent account there are only 200,000 CZK.
You don't have money?
You're talking about power colors, how's your looking?
I appreciate my powers to approximately 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a foundation with a value of 25 million, a apartment for approximately 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection that is worth approximately 10 million, and a aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a super-scodo, which is about one million, and then I have a few million more on the account.
Moreover, the Aston Martin was a child dream - James Bond’el always me as he was caring, galant to women, and at the same time struck against evil.
You're driving a Aston Martin, have a 60 million assets and don't have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make some debts?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not really interested too much.
And I am not obligated to combat the campaign from my own funds.
The costs for the campaign are in fact covered by my content as a senator.
But I couldn't live by the Senator's content alone; for example, I could not finance my son's English school that costs 300,000 per month.
If I just wanted to buy money, I wouldn't be candidated for anything.
So, do you continue to be undertaken to have your outcome?
Didn't you say you're going to take these A's back?
But this doesn't relate to the height of the content.
As I promised, I've partly returned my A's back.
For example, my vice-president will be the leader of the travel office in the early year.
People want to see me as Samaritans who save the Republic.
But I have to live from something.
Which monthly income was you used to be undertaken?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's the way.
However, as a President, I would completely set up my enterprises.
The complete talk can be found in the Saturday issue of Pravo.
The MVRDV architects demonstrate that the true aventures are not only in the head - for example, spijkenise and the latest books - 2 photos
"I find the building fun, it looks futurely, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the road border.
And Stefan Spermon, the IT technician in a nearby big story, says, "But, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder why we need another booking today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and E-books.
No man goes to one of these old-style libraries yet today, right?
Spijkenisse, a little needed sleep city before the gate Rotterdams, is a recordable recorder.
The 80,000 inhabitants community shows the lowest education rate of all Netherlands.
In order to resist this stupid situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general training and to identify the seven ficticial bridges presented on the euros as nicely designed steel beton miniatures.
The success of educational publicity remained in frontiers.
And so the city fathers recognized that there was only one way to become the Statistic Lord: A library must be here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdamer architectural office MVRDV, the master of the talented balken graphs and product of vital, so often Cynical buildings, took the thing with habitual opportunity and occurred to competition hearing year 2003 with five books under the arm and a border in the face.
And while the jury was still deceived to look and shocked with the axes, the frequent Maas stooped his reading behavior to a pyramide and ended his activistly dismayed speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is my proposal for the bookerberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros have been shot.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which also belongs to deep garage, super, post and a few limited homes with a total of 50 apartments.
In the beginning of November, the bookerberg was exposed to the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is nominated for the National Wood Award 2012.
This is the unseenly small city department, which had no longer been offered than a postmodal foot passenger zone and a crucial race, behind which white fashions would have been intended to assume a molecular factory in order to acquire a piece of modern architecture.
In particular, Spijkenisse is now about the first public culture in the history of his existence.
The long path to the book
First impression: bookereldorado under caes.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massive, the real room and reading pleasures come to the footing of the topography.
The surrounded internal room is light and overwhelmed, the burned clinder ground and the elegant road latters speak unexpectedly the language of a public city.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already looking at Parkbank, dog and football boys and girls playing.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally the book rules are near the fascination, and in the middle of the middle of a large, dark room, which is most improper and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and cut the reading area from inside to outside.
The inside of the bookberg is correctly sent: In the middle of offices, internet libraries, shach clubs, environment and household technology.
A special pleasure is the black book rules that are once wall clothing, once bruising, once growing countries.
Optics, haptics and churchs are strangers.
Even incorporated architects and building engineers shoot the head of the unrecognized building substance.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," says Joop Trouborst, project leader at the town-community Spiekenisse, on request of the standard.
And so we have been cast into a friesland farming a day on a waste product from agriculture.
Since many years, in the Netherlands, a milymethrone of plastic meat has been used as a root foundation in farms and fields.
That's fair and timeful.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it's reef for the lock.
For the library, the Vlies was first printed in these quantities to four centimeter thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is transferred to a dark, homogeneous, chargeable material, which drives a bissl after new cars and a bissl to sportshot.
After 105 steps, you've been joined at the box.
At the end of nearly 500 meters long warranty, not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with netherlands croquets and filled ficus trees are rewarded in literature cafe.
They provide for atmosphere, especially for the proper air fuels in the literature building.
S’ for the new soul
"It would not believe it, but this house is a project of preview in pointo ecology despite many glass areas," says Trouborst.
Coated and coated with earthquake.
Although the bookerberg is under a glass turbulence, the sun itself seems to be short inside on sundays.
The broad wooden limbs, who are at the glass fassade, serve as an estimate and begin a majority of the sun radiation.
The space climate is very pleasant.
The full-automatic roles are performed.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT broadcast, already waited the way to the new booking.
Lisette Heague was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who is the Boekenberg as the "longer overtime soul".
The reason: For a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to make a book from a personal stock.
This is the first time that the optical boxes in the library that is not yet completely supported - are currently 700,000 pieces.
The concept has occurred.
The rules are up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a halfer library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for the kidney.
This is what MVRDV has been able to do with the king's disabilities that are called in the Fachjargon Foundation.
Spikeness has written literature stories.
It may be so young and unfair too.
This is, finally, an approach to the efficiency.
Szabo: "The Germans must play greater role"
Germany has voted on the vote of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert for US European relations, Berlin balances in a low diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week, Germany had signaled that it would vote against the request of the Palestinian observer status at the United States.
But then, Berlin's coming out.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Germany must be careful now because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it doesn't support the position of the Ananias.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence, however, without being too critical to Israel.
In the currency of the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also included the vote when it was to establish a flight prohibition zone.
This was implemented by the NATO.
Is Germany difficult to take a clear position in important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is the fact that it just turns his external policy away from one who was so requested by the United States to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to conclude that the Europeans are not coherent and unified.
So the Germans are between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used.
I think that they were still involved in their role, but they are on the way to a "normaler" external policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean in particular from German view?
It shows the willingness to relate to national interests also to positions independent of those of the United States or partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, so the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are different in a certain degree than those of the other large powers, and therefore Germany must have its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Neighbourhood conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
In one case, Germany has a large part market in the Near East, especially in the Golf States.
Therefore, it must be cautious to not put the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
That's a role in any case.
But I would also not want to have too much weight, that is not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany protected its relations with the United States by providing important decisions of the vote, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I don't think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have a certain respect.
Because it signals that it is to be taken seriously as international players and needs to be deprived of his interests.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
However, the United States have clearly spoken for a Veto.
Is there differences between the United States and many N.E.?
As a result of the internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has a lot of understanding for the position in secret.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position.
I think the real differences of opinion are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and the Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so nicely enjoyed by Netanjahus.
Is Germany difficult to agree with his close relationship with Israel and the United States on the one, and the position of the major partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there is a coherent and unity, which is not currently the case.
So they can't be part of a wide line, and they have to put things out of their own position.
They just do that with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in putting Europe into a strict position in the future.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany because of the relationship with Israel.
It was always a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Is Germany himself in the role as a major international player - would Germany at all take a major role?
Or does Germany still fall the role of the leadership?
Germany is not yet used, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the Eurocrisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, the different anti-German feelings will be released.
That doesn't make the Germans easy.
This is the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
This is how Germany is seen in a much worse position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the impact of the United States in the European Union continues to decrease, but at the moment of this vacuum, who else remains there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them, and it makes them much more unemployed - c'est la life!

"Mark protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known mark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
What, then, is Armani Polo?
Thereafter, there is a completely official name in China which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, she enjoys the protection as long as the name providers do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they are right.
"It will be more difficult for foreigners to shalt their marks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the Taylor Wessing office, specialized on protection rights in Fernost.
Every week, a new case is landing on my desktop.
The followers already have a few additional letters so that they may notify their marks.
That's what Gu simply makes Lu-Gu, place Prada allows you to enter Prada-Kny.
In addition, German companies are thus legally copied, such as the Sport Articles Manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the brand office in Peking.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company allowed the product mark Zegna DF Puma, a artist name that also served in the home of Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese world masters are in copying and in damaged spiritual property is it.
In the big cities there are multiple purchase houses that almost exhausted falsehoods.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: In his man's mandate, he suggests that Chinese companies are very officially entitled to use a name that has already been dealt with in other places.
The Chinese calls the "Bang Mingpai", a campaign.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
That is what women are able to do with rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of their fault
"It's busy, it's necessary to fight," Pattloch requests.
"The mark is disappointed, the only setting disappears, the images' damage is enormous."
The financial accidents and the processes of the sectors concerned go into millions, especially in fair preliminary products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is a 15 billion euro volume per year of the largest market for luxus articles and the fastest growth.
However, the deletion of dubios inputs in the marking registers is difficult to get and go to money.
To nine years, the procedure can take place, with an inconscient outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the Court rejected complaints because after the long time of the "market reality" name has become.
If the complainant has Pech, he must even buy the plagiator money because he hurt his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes here is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also relate to graphical elements.
2009 Daimler lost a conflict with the Baumakin manufacturer Sany, the company who recently took the German Beton Putzmauer Putzmaster.
Therefore, the Chinese can use an emblem that is similar to the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo Buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the fight was held, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of Lacoste lost in China against Nahamer from Hong Kong and Singapore, who allowed the famous crocodile to look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of their fault.
The CTMO Office in Peking, though, states that it has been given in 2010 for less personal and spatial compensation.
In the past year, however, the "notification in the time of work is returned to normality".
In this case, the stock of inappropriate contracting procedures shall be decreased by 22 Pro.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than in the previous year.
However, 81.500 votes were still expected in the Office.
Too much cost to join
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year, more than 1.4 million mark protection applications were introduced in the CTMO, almost one third of the 2010.
This is a record and means that China for the last time brings the list of new logins around the world, the Authority communicates.
This also obtained for the stock of all valid marks, in total 5.5 million pieces.
2011 1.8 billion Yuan were taken into taxes.
Simplified means that each registration in 1280 Yuan or 160 euro is costed.
However, it costs a simple cost, as the case of the German family company shows joynberg.
For more than seven years, the concerts have been fighting against a Chinese plagiator.
As a result, the Germans could demonstrate that its illegal manufacture of imitated vehicles was exhausted.
However, the neighbourhood continued to secure the Chinese rights on the mark joynberg.
It has been disappointed, since family names could not be seized in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, the president of the business management of joynberg Chemical Specialities in München.
The brand office CTMO showed the Münchners' commitment.
In the next two instances, the joyberg was correct, but the opponent continues to fight until today.
You need to be careful.
Now the matter is binding before the Master Court of Justice.
Wentzler is convinced to bring the thing to a good conclusion, and the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely sustainable and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs have not been limited to the fact that the company's archive has to have even a hundred years of old acts to make evidence.
Five years ago, joynberg of the opposite offered a "height-sixth euro amount" to participate.
"It is why you see how much it is worth us," says Wentzler.
The Fernocs even threatened to go back to Europe.
Well, then, if the imitators are insured of unexpected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to notify the name of joynberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has abandoned the concerns long, yet he could reject the registration.
"You must be careful," Wentzler says.
He and the lawyer Pattloch advised German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to leave international marking rights, rather, the foreigners should "notify all that is worthwhile, even in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more furious than the registration.
In fact, if joynberg is subjected in the last act of his marking drama, then the other side of the license fees should be made for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are thrown out of the market in the questionary segment.
Worldwide Day: Stamps, songs, help
In Heidelberg pro日 the Chor Imbongi - and Swaziland, Aidswajs are enjoyed.
The history of a connection that overcomes more than 8733 km.
First, there is the stamp: cowboystivel, basketball shoes, female pumps and lord lippers look for the takt on the parked ground, find him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the songs slowly slowly - Alt, Bass, Tenor and Sopran - slow down and persecute themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, has almost made it out of his shoes when he brings them together with his distressed wild gestures.
It is Montagabed, a new song in the Music of the Medical Psychology Institute in Heidelberg pro日 of the Chor Imbongi.
At the fifty songs and songs, between 23 and 69 years of age, from the human genetic to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each cross vote has another text and it is also in a very strange language: Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mosambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Aid to self-aid
There are around 34 million HIV inhibitors worldwide, which appreciates Unids, the United Nations programme for AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 AIDS are living.
More than 40% of the population are HIV.
For 180 AIDS wheels in the village of Esitenti, the Verene Voices for Africa Paten found in Germany.
70 of them visit a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, a patent can be taken.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm food daily at the Gogo Centre.
Imbongi means to Zulu historic or also lobpriser.
The Bantu seems to speak flexiblely in this room no one, but singing.
For almost ≥ years, the Chor Li has exercised in this foreign language and has brought them back and back to where they originally come: to South Africa.
Since 8 733 km airline from Heidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitzeni, which depends on the vote of the German Chores.
Forty Pro's are insufficient
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple lahm and electricity houses, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are taken to the HI-virus.
In Esiteniu, there is a small place in which the whole Swaziland is sick: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest expectation of life worldwide as unicef.
Restrictions of men's prejudice, which evidently reduce the risk of deterioration, are not accepted by the population.
More than 40 people in Swaziland are the Immunity Virus in itself to die with a middle of 30 people is not rare.
In a common African travel in early 2005, the Chor discovered the village, but in particular the Imbongis saw many children on the streets that it lacked not only older care, but also at all: eating, clothing, education.
Without school closing, you have no chance in a poor country.
First, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros per year and to allow him to eat a warm dinner day.
But for a year later, the Chor found the United "Voices for Africa", who has already been almost professionally concerned about the AIDS waives in Esitani.
Sexual-transferable infections
What are the most important sexually transmissible diseases?
The bacterial STI includes Sy ’lis, Chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Common viral STI are HIV, human papilomavirs, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Figures and sticks belong to the parasitary STI.
Who are the main groups concerned?
His ́lis and trippers are particularly present in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute concludes that at least four of the five of the cases of Sy’lis in Germany will be overcome by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydiain infections, trichomonades, candidose, trippers and human papilomavirs are often sexually transmissible diseases.
The spread of HIV is comparably low among heterosexual adults - however: 20% of the new HIV infections occur to this group.
In youths, infections of Chlamydia are essentially more frequent than in other population groups.
After highlights, three quarters of all infections are young people between 15 and 25 years.
Moreover, human papilomavirs are often present in youths.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmissible diseases are obligation to report.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001, the number of Sy ́lis infections has doubled more than 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has returned since 2007.
2011 was around 2700 cases.
This is about a decade less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sexual illness?
Infectional diseases can result in injury in genital areas, difficulties in urination, exhausts, disturbance pains and bleaches or wars.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unremarkable.
How can you go?
Condoms can reduce the risk of covering, but don't offer a hundred percent protection.
Because in part, the illness of sexually transmissible diseases can also be transmitted by pain infections and close body contacts.
In particular, experts recommended regular investigations in frequently changed sex partners.
In early times, most STI can be healed and avoided late.
By patentships, S.A., and not recently, the gagens that the Chor sing in all Germany come together.
"We have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitani," says Annette Lennartz, the President of the United Nations.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and implementing woman, the money from Germany.
She also cares about that the wheat is well undergoing, with one of the grandmothers around.
The Gogos, as called old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 wheels, give them a cup over their head and ensure that children in their uniforms seem to appear to school every day.
Whoever has no more, comes into a protective house to Khanyisile, a single woman, which is paid by the unit as the two kitchens cooking for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Moreover, "Voices for Africa" has called a nearby school, built two houses of kitchen and organized PSI together with the Ananian Health Organization that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not self-comprehensive, for as obviously the illness is in the whole country, it is the most lovely dead.
A King with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "for it has sex."
In fact, rarely in a country where the king officially deserves 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africas, King Mswati III., is for his exc. lifestyle.
Polygami place of Democracy.
In addition, this Stately Sanctionated Life Form has also been schuldiged that the HI virus has spread so quickly in the past year.
But also the many trading workers who have the virus through the country.
Annette Lennartz says, "but they will not be useless.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Chor travels all two, three years together through the South Africa and sangs Li fully weeping, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, who know many in the southern cif of the black continent or from the times of the apartheid.
A bus full of whites that liʹ sing in a black language - so much recognition brings not only voice and joy, but also some wrathful border soldiers have disturbed some wears.
The journey also leads to Esitenti, where the songs visit their paten children.
Even if you don't find the small village on land maps, it's more than it.
"Go to Esitani, there's the light," people say there.
And if you turn back the 8733 km airline to Heidelberg, to the pumping songs in the proverb on the Mountheimer Street, you can see it light there.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the mercure
The Sunde Messenger has found evidence that there is any ice on the planet Merkur.
The iron cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S.R. NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although he lies on the next sun, there is also a rore water there, as shows from three lights published on Thursday in the Science Factory.
The Sunde Messenger has found evidence that there is a iron cover in the shadow region of the planet.
This shall be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even 20 metres thick.
The water was confused by comets or maybe asteroids that have been thrown on the mercure.
No one brings the ice fund but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Health, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the mercure can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the funds could help to clothe the water and other buildings of life in other areas of the sun system.
Unremarkable by the citizens of the Earth are soldiers, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix to investigate the depths of the world Hall.
From time to time, they have sent pictures to the earth: Small gocklocks in infinite winds.
The picture comes from a camera that developed German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, including the Zwerg Planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, running behind Neptun around the sun, Ceres, after the new definition of the International Astronomic Union of 2006, has not been "planet".
This image outline of an infraroot reception of the Spitzer Telescope shows an "Family Portrait" unnumbered staring: the oldest stars are to be recognized as blue points, to identifie more difficult the "newborn" pink colors in the star hall.
This star-forming region - of the students unromantly W5 - discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star image of Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This brilliant glut of a dead star has taken the Spitzer telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-formed ring consists of material that extended the star in the death process.
In the great Trifid Nebel, 5400 lighting years away from the earth, produce new stars from gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope of Nasa shot this photo of the galaxy birth level.
The Plejaden Starhead, including "The Seven Sisters", can be seen night with the only eye.
However, with the telescope, the colors are better in the light.
Like a red age, the Helix nebel looks at this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is 700 lightyears remote in the Aquarium star image.
His similarity to a earthly continent included this nebel in the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photos provides the spectacular coloring.
This babyster could be recorded in his full beauty only by the infraroot detectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How these have come up is one of the great races of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the rest of a Saturn Moon, which has disappeared unexpectedly 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and fastest records of the Hubble Telescope: Whirlpool galaxie
After coloring, the records of spiral galaxies will be made to real artworks.
The record published by the South Star of Europe shows the more than thousands of light years of trifid nebel in the star image Sîe.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (trided, three-country) because dark dust streams divide the lighting heart of the star-born places.
Astronomes have photographed the offers of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth races the kernels of two mixing galaxies and will be collidated unusually.
This star-born was the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxie M83.
Whoever doesn't lay technical decreases, he may call them at his top name of the Southern Fire Road.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows an extract from the Irisnebel in the star image of Kepheus.
The 1400 Light Year remote clouds consist of dust corners, which are up to 100 times smaller than the normal homepain.
This image was collected from optical and Röntgen records of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black lowers, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of Galaxy, Arp 273, took up the Space Telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The largest spiral galaxie called UGC 1810.
In this starnebel, the lightest group of young stars of our milk street is located.
The star wall always produces new Youngsters.
Also these star-wolves, connected with the rose-nebel, brings new baby stars running - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this light radiant galaxie with a small black loch there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe that he has occurred shortly after the urknall when the universe was primarily found water.
Our views in all: The most important telescope
The telescope would have been found by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galileo used it for a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optic telescopes were always bigger - and the ideas they provide are always deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale-Telescope in Palomar Observatorium was near San Diego.
The mirror, here in the picture, had a average of five meters.
The large binocular telescope is in Arına, the United States.
It allows in all the same way over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is great - only the mirror comes to 10,4 meters in the diameter.
The mirror of South African Great Telescope in South Africa is segmentated - to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reached a diameter of about 11 meters.
Return of the favourable building: The telescope is fixed in ≥ height angle - and thus restricted in its movement.
Also the Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is set in the height angle.
His ability: the high light assembly.
This is, in fact, enough, despite comparatively small speech mediators, to the worldwide largest speech telescope.
With a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers hear all of the signals of outermost.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help each computer owner by providing accounting.
On the observatory of the European Star Wait (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - the name makes all honor.
With its total of four mirrors, the remote roof can also clarify the average infraroot spectrum.
Similarly, the European Extremely Extremely Telescope is planned on the Chilean ESO Observery.
His main level is to set 42 metres in a range and is set together from approximately 1000 mirror elements.
However, with pictures, it is to be calculated at the earliest end of 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Vulkan Mauna Kea were the biggest of the world.
They also offer two mirrors with an average of → meters.
The Keck telescope is part of the Mauna-Kea Observerators, watching near them with the subaru telescope and IRT.
Moreover, on Mauna Kea, there will be a new, big telescope - with a middle of 30 meters of mirror.
Here it is to be found on an illustration.
However, the most important inputs from all are provided by the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, there are already pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler looks for extrasolated planets - especially for those who are residents.
On 2 February 2011, the Nasa was given that 1235 planet candidates were detected since the start of mission.
In the picture, the latest starting preparations are documented at the world's telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot at the board of a Ariane5 racket in all early 2018.
The primary level of the world infrared telescope has a diameter of 6,5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the urknall.
Objectives conclude that there is also the South Pool of Mercur ice.
However, there are no confidential data for it, since the messenger is far closer to the North Pool around the planet.
Radime's songs have been indicated for years that there is ice on the Mercury.
By 2004 started Messenger health - the first running around the mercure - the societies now have awareness.
Drink daily butter - and 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people have a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for long-term.
A trace search in the country in which 97 years are likely young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people have a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for long-term.
A trace search in the country in which 97 years are likely young.
The trip through the Taliban building is called wildromantic.
The small bus breaks over the curvenous street, over the nearly controlled hills, rivers and simple building houses.
Everything is green and soft, you might think you're in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Aserbaidschan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here is the Kakao's people group of Thailand, of which it is not much, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and asheric and is very long-life.
The final station is Lerik.
The small townhood is prosecuted with too deeply covered architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to match the Malerian mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are quickly coming here, too complained is the advocacy of the Azerbaijan capital of Baku.
For the 323 km, eight hours are required because the road is only simple.
The real richness that the country thanks to Oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the province.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has enough tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision-Song Festival - and in the next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum for long-term, it's the only thing in the world.
Here is the Vita of approximately eight duzens of Talycans documented from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
Another child born in the age of 136 years
But the controversy star of the museum is the shepherd Shirali Müslümov, who will be 168 years old.
However, there is no birthcurrent.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who has been 122 years old, Müslumov’s age seems very doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children geha, in the age of 136 years he would have born another daughter.
So Sherali Müslümov has been calculated in age for a few years?
But also burnt Scholz, older researcher at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high-bearers in Central Asia.
"There are also in some areas of China, Japan or Hunza Tal in Pakistan," says Scholz, "and in Sardinien live very many old men."
However, because of lack of documents, there is no scientific evidence of the age, including the persons' officers missing.
Each day, beauty-droped butter
But it is that the people of the region around Lerik often get a Bible age.
There are 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why do you live here in the south?
The Aserian Traveller Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Taliban.
Instead, the director of Fatulayeva believes that it is on the engine.
However, that the calorious cost of the Taliban should be so healthy to love meat, bread, and especially milk products, and from which many drink a glass mixed by daily, does not appear to be simply claimable from food scientific view.
Or is it the original way of life that people feel young? In Cengemiran, a winning seat near the city of Lerik, Rubab Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years, she is still young for these widespreads.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 followers, is in a simple wooden, which is typically for the entire Kaukasus region.
She is sitting on the ground with a butterfase that she is insufficiently rolling.
Eight people live here under a cup, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are longer older.
Two little kids also run around.
The kitchen is prepared for the guest tea served in the typical, rubber-formed armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in order and members, under her headcotch he lifts it a long, dark blonde pieces that her son enthousiasms before us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their colour.
"Shampoo I've never used," Mirzayeva says.
Month currency enough for life
She's always eating what was from her own court, tomates, cartoffles, herbs.
All my life I have not bought once in a super-food food.
Then she told her about her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst time after World War II.
But everything was better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took the ruder.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the colt that is running around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, does not know the limits of Azerbaidschan.
By 2003, he was at power, later his son Ilham took the Ruder.
There is always no need under the old Azerbaijan.
230 Manat (a.k.a. the same amount in the euro), Mirzayeva receives a amount each month as rents, for today's conditions a good life.
And maybe Mirzayeva's son has the right to say, "The elderly enjoy our culture's respect."
They live in the middle of the grand family, they will be worryed, careful and happy.
If this is not a reason to stay as long as possible in life
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution was returned to Kairo.
Rivalising Kunships in Kairo reveal the deep split of the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as a base is hardly contrary.
The Egyptian president did not spare with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he is able to live in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to the Christian heads, the liberals, the manifested muslims and the s mundan.
Because they have all, until now, unexpectedly disappeared in a confused opposition.
In front of a godly state at the Nil of Grace of the powerful Muslim Brothership.
He, likewise, said Mohammed Mursi almost apologizing to circumcise the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended its powers to "save the revolution".
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who brings a doctor title of the South Californian University of South, really wants to save, is the Egyptians, the world is not clear.
Whether the justificative is drawn
In fact, the 234 articles that have been reflected in part in a 15-hour parforcery, partly concerned by the 100-country constitutional assembly, which is dominated by the islamist.
Like in previous constitutions, the draft is based on the "Prin-Islamic Law".
But what does it mean "Prin'ia"?
This was and is an interpretation and it is expected that the islamists will use the weak formulation and the incoming legal game room for a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
This is at least a new article to be mentioned: In all cases related to the Scharia, the University of Al-Ashar must be allowed, the main islamic institution of the country with great radiation in the entire Sunnith Islam.
This must not be, but it may mean that the priesthood watchs the law, which de facto would result in the denunciation of the Judicians.
The design of replacement is interpretation.
It is also difficult: civil military justice should continue to continue.
These courts served during Mubarak's government to undermine oppositional.
After the time of the dictator, up to 11.000 civilians sat in military.
The state too, it says in the draft, "the true being of the Egyptian family" "and promote their moral and their values".
This is legally so unfair that public institutions can control the contents of film art and literature through this article.
In the original text it doesn't mean anything else than Zensur.
In addition, no articles expressly determine the equality of men and women.
That is why another, the prophet Mohammed and his messengers, prohibited to discipline or defeat.
But what a disappointment is, and how it is to be adhered, remains unclean.
Similarly, dubios encourages the formulation that "proliferation of people" is prohibited.
Does the president's carrier or an injury at the cost of a jury teacher?
Explainment as much in the draft, the Mursi proposes to sign, and, according to his words "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented to the peoples' vote.
"The revolution has been returned"
The opposition has been shaped for weeks against the oversight of islamists.
Ten thousands gathered themselves in an inhabited conviction on Friday on the Tahrir place in Kairo and promised to take the Charta to the case, even before it could enter into force.
"The revolution is returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, the third presidency elector.
Peace nobel prices and the former Chief of the International Atomic Energy, Mohamed El-Baradei, explained that the constitutional draft is "on the M'berg of history".
Via Kursing News Service Twitter accused the added Mursis to lead a "Putch against Democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we'll go to the palace and break it," said Oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not still tired that the blood of our brothers has not yet been bound," quoted the Egyptian media to the opposition policy Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum would not want to be monitored so that it would be wrong.
"The Coran is our Constitution"
The well-organized muslim brothership is on its side to the opposite demonstration, but not at the Tahrir place, but after a massive prayer on the other Niufer before the Cairo University.
The women and the attachers of the salafists participated in it and cried: "The people require the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi, "Please the land!" and said, "The Quran is our constitution."
A battle around the Majesty over the symbolic Tahrir-place at which all started would have increased civil war-like conditions.
It was obvious that Mursis attachers wouldn't risk it.
The Muslim brethren explained that both the opposers of the Constitutional draft and the Beer would have expressed themselves soundly and clearly.
Now it is time to let the people decide in the election to go to the country.
A majority of the islamists' draft is to be safe.
"The word of human rights doesn't even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is aware of this forced constitutional process, which would have gone until February and should integrate all social powers.
The 48-year human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended the muslim brothers when they were in prison or were in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are unpartial for him.
For that reason, he was condemned, arrested.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he regrets in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power on all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are eccatant violations against democratic game rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictature.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the President puts it out of facto," complains Saeda.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels alone, including the international community, which considers the ideological direction camp on the Nile with a mixing of news and spending.
That could be enough.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "You are born a monster that you cannot control anymore."
Rakfish from Norway: Is this the worst fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe, but in the world.
Could the country's successful secret have something to do with the local appetite on a pretty bad fish?
You're taking a selection of excessive cases.
They are placed inside a pitch of painful, flat sport clothing.
And let them go there a week.
So soon, you must imagine the narrow-deploying Church of Rakfish, one of the great delicates of Norway.
I'm in the small city of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is a snow here, a speech-cular landscape - and this hard-break crystal in the air that simply doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a forelle stretched with salt, which - depending on how intensive you would like its fish - is fermentated up to one year in water.
When the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets cold, Norwegians flow to a festival here in Fagernes, which is, now, actually, very well-being speciality.
"Man eats it and then split it down with a glass Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who is in the local fire watch, but also makes the festival as so-called "Rakfisk-General".
To us, people devote small fisheries and take a large amount of alcohol.
"Man likes the aquavit more than the rakfish," Havard says.
Spirituosis can disturb the church.
I'll cost a few hops.
If you avoid bringing the rackfish near the nasen, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a very long bus travel back.
Rakfish is the product of a whole other poor Norwegian epoch when there were no cold opportunities and fish was beared in air-deep waters.
In the deepest winter, he was exhausted after long fermentation and, of course, devoted to alcohol.
Before a generation, thousands of Norwegians looked forward to seeking work to leave their country and seemed mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is quickly - more than 13% are immigrants, affected by a flowing work, high rewards and a comprehensive health.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was not long ago richer than Norway, streaming immigrants.
Rakfisk is viewed as something important - as an essential, even though strictly ridiculous part of the Norwegian history.
He belongs to the deadly courts you can buy here.
But here's all a bit - a small glass beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often get into the world press, and most people don't seem to do it.
Here you still hate the name of Andres Breivik - those racistic legal extrémists who killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, you are only referring to the "reaction of 22 July".
Norwegians make it difficult to accept that someone in his peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industry in the world since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why it's good for us," says our cellner, which distributes round tablets with rafish rack, and with its long flowing hair and the black eyes cover the northern idea.
We are one - as you say - aware people.
Your English is just like that most people here makellos.
We're not very disappointed, we don't like pleasure.
Norway has been very careful with oil richness - a large part of the branch contracts is invested in a special fund for the future generation.
In the years to the world economy crisis, everyone with money that they did not even possess, Norway kept his money worth.
"So long as we can walk in winter Ski and turn on summer, we are happy," says.
"And, of course, rackfish," they added with an unfortunate smile.
I am standing in the snow and putting me to another court - I have enough Rakfisk.
Such an elch-burger is something else in any case.
But on the evening, the fish is back on the food plan.
The hotel in which I log in is one of several events that organize a rackfish dinner at the best guest - or maybe the clergy's most demanding - can vote on fish.
There is a live TV screening to a showmaster covered with fîe, surrounded by tellers with rakfish.
The speech is similar to Eurovision Song Contest.
"What point do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"There are our points, Havard."
You're crazy and laughing.
A man falls from chair, possibly overwhelmed by Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict dust of the whole fish.
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto is before difficult start
As Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto is prepared for his official approach, Will Grant analyses the challenges of the BBC and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the vere in Mexico is very bad.
Even in better days, this is always a hidden city, but on Monday a ring of steel was created, which was locked up several important roads to the capital city and cared for the roads for chaos.
However, the aim was not to switch pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrants from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the chairman's commitments and take the leadership of the nation.
He's in front of a complex task.
Under the separate Government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to be economically able, but the country is in the face of a war that has been able to live 60,000 people in the last six years.
"My Government is strongly committed to reduce violence," Pena Nieto told the US President Barack Obama at Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to achieve this objective.
Before he went up with the US president, Pena Nieto was occupied as Governor of his home country of Mexico.
In this nearby, broad-term part of the country that surrounds the capital, the opinions of the new national headquarters are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small city Valle del Bravo, for example, you like to remember him.
The residents of the holiday site write to him the development of tourism and the building of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the cars that made Pena Nieto build and represent a great improvement towards the broken, holpy roads that were once here.
Plackets with names also depend outside a modern sport room and a impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and persistent changes from him," such as his friend and political associated Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who is a Congress Minister for the Party of Pena Nietos, the PRI.
As regards security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that has made our country so cruel.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was solved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress Deputy Olvera recognises that the party, after 12 years outside the presidential Palace of Los Pinos, provides great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
The proposal of opposition, the new president, refuses.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has large plans for the country.
He is a wonderful stateman, especially he is someone who can listen.
But on the other hand of the State, many people do not share this view of their former Governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, including Ciudad Neza, the contrast could not be greater than the roads of Valle del Bravo.
The place is hidden under transportation of cars, and in many ways represents a city of Mexico.
And the problems in the community are determining urban nature.
In the beginning of this year, the military was enabled to fight the operating bands in the fourths, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a flack Brachland near a large M'deponie, the bodies of the twelve killed women were left alone in the last two years.
During the time of office of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico - a statistics that even overcome the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is justified for their violence and murder of innocent women.
The criticians Pena Nietos believe that he has not at least addressed the problem of women murder during his office.
However, in the worst case, his government has closed their eyes before the problem.
In a beton building, typically for the downcoming quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the trees when she shows me photos of her devastated daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of events stated that Mariana began suicide 2010.
But their family believes that she was killed by her lifemates.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that it was struck, and the body star has already been used.
As their mother told her story, she looks down to us from the wall a picture of Mariana. It is drawn near a cross that brings one word: justice.
But exactly this, like the family, has been disappointed to her until now.
The authorities have treated me like I'm a weaker, an injury, a norgler.
You want to simply accept her judgment and keep her mouth.
"But this is not possible if there were so many forms of mistakes and disappointments," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the legacy of the president on Saturday, he will also take a large responsibility.
Ten thousand Mexican families have been committed by violence crime in the past six years, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem especially during his office.
"I hope he is as the President as Governor," says Pri-Congress Deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most of them.
Advocate stated: Bradley Manning did not complain about misleading
Advocate Bradley Mannings' proposals that he has been misleading in prison
The hearing includes Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
Defence stresses a rejection of the accusations on the basis of strong claim conditions
The freedom of the US army is expected to have made thousands of trusted documents
The State Advocate tried on Friday to find that the Army Free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest enthousiasm of confidential information in the US history - had disappointed several opportunities to complain about the misleading he had been prompted in military.
At a cross-concerning Mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained. Ashden Fain that documents on weekly visits, the prison officers during Mannings, nine months of prison in Quantico, Virginia, did not show any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross audience, which, due to a defence request, was revoked - Manning had already been punished sufficiently by the hard prison time - had said Manning that he would have incarcerated the suicide in prison.
The Secret Service Analysis of the US Army, arrested in June 2010, will be presented while his service time has stolen thousands of confidential documents in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never considered Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein with Manning went through the forms, the officers had held after their meetings with Manning during his prison in Quantico military prison, where he had placed under strengthened prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him to the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment totally as "very professional".
The formalists, so Fain, had no complaints about misleading, although the officer Manning had questioned directly to his treatment.
Maning replied that he had expressed his thoughts mentally and the officers would have discussed them with him and told them to discuss them, but they were not registered.
"He wrote (after meeting of thoughts) "No problem" and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything," so Manning.
Judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met a committee in January 2011, which should examine the thoughts of suicide that he had before him on a formula.
Maning replied that his view during this meeting was to reduce his observation status to "prevention of damage".
The military stated that he had this restrictive status - which stands under self-mortal control - and has been assigned to protect others.
"I wanted to convince the employees that it was good for me, and that the status of observation for the prevention of damage... will be released to achieve a quality of life from my view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday of his arrest and department to Kuwait, where he was arrested about two months before he was transferred to the prison of the Marine Basis Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said in Kuwait he was insatisfactory and became unconscious once because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or in the foreign world.
"My world crossed on Camp Arafjon, on this coffee together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this coffee.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning has spent the majority of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You have only allowed him a matrix, a cover, a flip-flops, clothing, and his brilliant brilliant.
Manning said he tried to stay in movement, because it was prohibited on the day to sleep or to be stuck.
He always had to sleep with a light, which went from outside into his cell.
If he turned around the night and wasn't able to see his face anymore, he was awakened to return.
In January 2011 Mannings lawyer made formal conviction against the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison by Fort Leaven′th, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he slept a night in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked before guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Maning had said he had never had the opportunity to handle his deck during this calculation.
At the question on Friday, Manning announced that he had concluded from a command of his guard that he should leave the cover with which he could have covered himself. However, he told that no one had invited him.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked on the previous night. He had previously tried to show a officer that he was not present for himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the bond of his underhouse or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but this does not.
This night, as mening said, his underhouse, Flip-flops and brilles were removed from his cell.
His advocates hope that the judge will at least take into account its detentions and reduce its detention, and that he should be condemned before the military court, which is used for the beginning of the next year.
The defence has stated that maning will be acknowledged for a lower offence, while other claim points that are considered too extremely are too important.
Continuation of the hearing is used for this weekend, and the State advocate is expected to justifie the conditions of detention.
The pentagon remains in its position that maning has been kept in accordance with the provisions that apply to all prisoners held under the maximum security provisions in Quantico.
The complaints against Manning include the favor of the enemy, the illegal publication of secret services on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the stealing of public property or documents.
If he is guilty at all points of complaint, he is threatened by a life-life arrest penalty.
My Mexico-American Energy Crisis.
People have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of chances
Mexican people tend to accuse the migrants - they call them hard time in memory, he says
Navarrette is the view that mexican Americans have been captured between two worlds
On a recent journey to Mexico City, I just had passed through the hall and was at the passenger control when the unconsciousness came to me.
Schilder referenced to two waiting serpents: one for "Mexicanos" (Mexicanus), another for "Extarearos" (Exteriors).
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertainly to whom I should be.
I was raised in Central California and my whole life was called "Mex".
A ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I disappeared for "Mexican Amer".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's house, there was no need for shortcuts or bones.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish at least good enough to say me in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother proclaimer, and I'm not going to leave my action.
So I took my travel passenger and put me into the serpents for extranieros.
I thought about the moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda, all the subjects that are expected to be met by the heads of these two countries: immigration, and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in speaking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for mexican people today to stay in Mexico with the same high probability in the Mexico, instead of immigrating into the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block as an example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the cards, even though he did not call details about it.
Mexican relationship with the United States is complicated and full of sensation.
Most Americans, probably, never dismiss one thought that the United States included in Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leaders to leave them more than the help of their territory.
But for Mexico who think in centuries and not in minutes, reminders of this event are not to be overviewed.
So when a US government officer acts as soon as the smallest criticism in Mexico, you hear - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complain about how the Americans threaten the sovereignty of their neighborhood.
And the children of Montezumas are walking on the way of war.
Yet, the greatest challenge of Mexico is in truth in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentiments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers chances, and others for whom this doesn't do.
The only reason for living so many people of Mexico in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a point in our stam tree a person - maybe a parent or larger - has not been offered a chance in Mexico and was immigrated in the north.
And in most cases, this person expressed a profile - dark, unfair, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the dream of the Ananias, visit schools and have received jobs, we can never lose from the eyes that it is the dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our integrity may sometimes be disrupted, but our loyalty is not the case.
This applies clearly to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
You see us as a mantime of humiliating destruction and look at us down because we are not mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough to our bands in Mexico never be strong enough.
Your opinion is that our existence is a symbol of the shader.
If our families didn't fail in Mexico, they wouldn't go.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves captured behind the seat, with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who was immigrated legally to the United States, reminds me that there are spending between Mexico and Mexico Americans because Mexico has a clearer idea of who they are - and mexican Americans take this wrong to them.
As it is a US State citizen, it seems to be part of two countries.
But many mexican Americans, whom I know, have the feeling of not belonging to one or another country.
We love the Mexican Band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You're enjoying the best of both worlds, but it's not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we'll be seen as Americans.
And in the United States we will be seen as Mexico.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship more complex: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational civilisation want to take their connections to diaspora again.
They want mexican Americans to use as provisor "bootshops" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our colleagues how wonderful this country is and exercising pressure on the political leadership to intensify their commitments to Mexico.
No.
It won't be done.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair income distribution, the unfair corruption and the force, many of us are not so sure whether this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to go alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexico people are not ready to forgive the United States for the trade with Mexico for a second half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexico Americans have a role for such as their family members have not been treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "mexican" as I thought.
Old Wars, New Near East
The weapon stand between Israel and Hamas could be shown as unexpected basic arrows for peace
Can there ever be a standing peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Near East?
The latest bloody events seem to arise such a hope in the kim.
A number of buildings were placed in Schutt and Asche, more than 140 Palestinians who killed most of these citizens, and six Israelites - and for the first time rackets from Gaza were hit near the Israeli Metropole Tel A and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, though the Israelites and Palestinians seem to be captured in their historical conflict, the Near East changes around them.
The Arabic prejudice has created a new, unknown situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinian and Israeli have become part of these races.
Maybe this will only lead to more blood losses.
However, there are reasons to assume that the mortal pattsituation could finally find its end.
A war that will not be lost or won
On the first corner, optimism seems to appear in the face of the current situation other than.
Even if the weapons residue agreed on 21 November, these weekly fights have strengthened the hard-societed on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the islamic movement, which has been controlled by the Gaza streams since 2007, will be claimed to have returned to Israel, although his own group had to lose great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Stream are dedicated in one of the most desolate and closely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet been able to destroy the Hamas.
In fact, the Hamas in Western Jordan wins, controlled by the rivalising, consequent Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As islamists in the Arab world have won influence, the Hamas have been able to move strong and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a rearranging, regional power, one of the most rich and dynamic golf states, has adopted for the Hamas Party - just as Katar.
Jubelant Hamas attachers believe that Israel is a islamic halfmond - from the Libanon north, where the military Hisbollah has power, overwhelming where rebels of a continuing islamic prejudice could stand before the destruction of Bashar Assads, until Jordan, where Hamas associates threatened the king.
In particular the growth of the Muslim Brothership under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most strong and most important Arab country - in the southern flat of Israel, has sustainable changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot, who ruled Egypt up to August 2011 for 30 years, had only little time left for the Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood is weak with the Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on national views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could be demonstrated as an actor who can not be removed by Israel and the United States.
In contrast, the Israeli Hardliners allow an oppositional conclusion.
Militaryly seen the Hamas is no more.
The Iron Dome, the Israeli raquetation system, has been able to stumble, and many of the hamas rackets have been strictly dealt with.
At least a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
In diplomatic views, the United States are unfair to their position.
Israel has succeeded in the past years, especially among the Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to large parts.
Although rackets from the Gaza Stream have killed about 30 Israelites since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of self-mortal boards - not later thanks to the locking systems that have passed into the main part of a Palestinian country, which continues to be built by the Jewish seditions, which have been explained for national lawlessness.
Netanyahu is well there. His Likud party connected to a more conflicting group under the walls on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these Palestinians also disappoint and leave their own state?
If they actually had the control over West-Yordanland, wouldn't they like their hosts in the Gaza stream, too, be thrown into rackets?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them, they should take the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to carry out, but the Arabic pregnancy could make them a strike through the account.
Even if the Islamists who are now in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will be able to face the difficulties in their own country.
The defence status of Israel is greater than his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to establish their economy.
That the pragmatic president Mursi is together with Barack Obama to achieve a weapons stand, may be a promised sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
The Israelites should also think longer.
As the rest of the Arab world takes steps towards democracy, the Palestinians continue to have their self-determination right - a pulmonary phase that will, of course, explode in the Israeli occupied areas, just as this week exploded a bus in Tel A.
The pressure of the democracy in the Jewish state is already present, and with the growth of the Arabian population, this situation will only be strengthened.
Blood missions to recover Hamas in Gaza streams will continue to call for their diplomatic tribut over the years.
Both pages need an end of outside
The right answer is those who represent the most reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: two countries in which Israel is in security areas.
The - for the nearby small future - hope is that the state of weapons will give more effects to the implementation of this solution.
Egypt now has to stop the weapons deliveries in the Gaza streams together with Turkey and Katar and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas from the idea of a Jewish State on the basis of the limits of 1967, completed by area exchange and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab N's should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have been done more for the establishment of a Palestinian State than for the previous request for UN observatory status.
Obama also has to take part in moving Israel into negotiations.
In the currency of his first office, he dismissed the idea of his own peace plan.
A lot remote in the white house seems to be distracted by a share.
But this is a suspicious, short-term perspective.
The United States have a significant interest in a stable close east.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Entry into force of uniform cycle packing laws
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packages equal to all tobacco marks
The worldwide first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packages have entered into force. This will replace brand logos and colors by neutral, olive green deckles, which are printed by drastical images, which are parts of the body and the children affected by cigarette smoke.
From the different health warnings and pictures once, the only subdivision between the packages in the label names printed in identical, small letters is from the next Saturday.
This involves the worldwide strongest arrangements for tobacco packages.
The Australian Federal Government wants young people to take away from smoking by eliminating the glamous image of the tobacco consumption.
This is what the Government has shown that people who have not yet started to smoke will not be started with 99% of the likelihood.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message to ask for the tobacco concentrators with their marking image," as the Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek. They quote, for example, those who have shown that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world and the changes will only be lowly affected by the profits of the multinational concerts, other countries have already made similar steps.
The tabaklobby struggled hard against the laws.
Thus it said that with the laws, the black trade would be favorable to make bilingue and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, undesirable consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco.
Chinese and Indonesian falsehoods will offer a larger amount of these products on the roads.
Others, however, say that the laws have covered their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family enterprise, notes that the request for cigarettenetuis and siliconeckles have increased greatly since the British American Tobacco Conzernes, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago in the highest australian courtship of the laws.
Zico has covered up to 6.000 big business units and waited for new stocks.
This is a business for us.
Experts say that the hakes in the population of social media are in the exact group of people to which the plan is addressed.
A number of australian laws has forbidden tobacco concessors from television, it has forbidden them to appear as sports sponsors and the most traders have forced to not long expose cigarettes in business. Now the tobacco advertising is changed to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited Internet advertising by local companies and pages, but there is no influence on international sides.
"Who has tobacco and has only a small area to ask for his products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports to marks that were included by "all normal people".
You need to ask yourself: Is this just a person who finds such a great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that it takes even a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco said that the industry was able to market with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new rules - those countries are complained by the World Trade Organization on unfair trade restrictions, despite any greater trade with any of the countries.
A WTO decision is expected for the middle of 2013.
According to Plibersek, the Government has conducted talks with other countries which have introduced similar package laws.
Canada was the first country that predicted photo warnings in 2001.
Meanwhile, these were extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Header laws are highlighted in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Australian smokers are proud.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You simply take a pipe and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tutor.
Honestly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the "King of the Pack" tobacco trading inside the city of Sydney, says that the unified packaging has difficulted the fulfillment of his regulations.
"I've had a hour before to order a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The Government should simply prohibit cigarettes fully - then we would have told us well, that was, we're doing close," for he's obvious to add.
In a constantly electricized world, it is nice to be even lowly
This thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours in the aircraft when our aircraft was experiencing because of mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another fabric.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts about long time.
I don't want to lie.
A half day on the airport waiting for a flight is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course free shopping) are available.
But more academics and children's development experts are a long time than something positive.
If it follows them, it's for us - and our children - all right, sometimes aware of it.
This forces the brain to lose himself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativeness.
And because most of us today are almost always looking on one or other screen, the benefits of the long time are no longer beneficial.
So should we welcome the long time with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll be back on it again.
As many people, I have always concluded that long time is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with the remaining time of freedom.
But Peter Toohey, Professor for Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale日 Press, 2011) does not see this.
"In fact, the long time has a very long story," he says.
The home walls of Pompeji is drawing a Latin Graffiti over the long time, which returns to the first century.
And then there's still the question how we define longweight.
According to John D. Eastwood, a associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that long time has been defined and discussed on many kinds.
Following long literature of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a group of approximately 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that long time as the experience, they want to exercise a pleasant activity, but it is not possible.
As a result, a long time distinguishing from Apathia is that the person is not busy but wants to be.
However, in the apathy, there is no force to do something.
The key execution of the long time, he says, is found in a "shopping of the attention process, partaking with bad pleasure and feeling that the time is just slow."
It can be almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, though these two situations could be related, see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are long-term, even if we have only difficulties to be able to cope.
In their Property "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to Germany at age: "The inactive understanding: the definition of longeweile under the aspect of attention", which appears in September in the physician "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues indicate to an earlier experiment, listening to the participant of a band on which a person reads a magazine article.
Some groups heard a sound television program from the neighborhood room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was rarely admissible while the group did not understand this sound.
The people who had not understanded the hearable television suggested to find more longer than the two other groups -- they had problems to converge themselves, they could not find any reason for it and wrote their difficulties of the long time.
If you are trying to consequence a difficult or anxious task, the sight of attention can lead to long time, Mark J. Fenske, associated professor for neurological sciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the Õe.
In contrast, if you are exercising a single activity - "as looking for mistakes on a manufacturer band, you can refuse music and help you not feel satisfied."
In fact, he says, we now know that the boxes and critics, often interpreted as signs for long time, can even fight by keeping people more careful.
"Studis have shown that children who can have hazards can learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to stay," says Professor Fenske.
All of us will be long-term - my late flight, a dry speaker, a particularly encouraged movie.
But some people are longer easier than others.
To measure these subsequents, researchers developed a "scale for long-term adventure" in the 1980s.
At the scale are statements like "Multieth things I have to do, repeat and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With such scales, researchers have found that boys become more longer than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor for Psychology at the University of West Florida - especially what is the need for more and a greater range of external routes.
But generally, teenages are a pretty relaxed crowd.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor for human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment where he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He discovered that 32% of the students in the school and in the performance of the home tasks were advanced, but 23% indicated that they were not at school.
But only 3% of the parents suggested that they felt successfully.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the proportions of the prolonged time have been cut off or disturbed.
However, he is sure that "the youth will be felt especially long-term," mainly because children and adolescents have no great influence on their daily past.
So back to my original question: Is long time healthy?
Sometimes it doesn't, because in extreme cases, it leads people to extreme physical risks and to the lucky game or to linch them - that have shown them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between long time and creativeness. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the subject for more than two years.
"With the long time the brain wants to say to do something else," so Gary Marcus, Professor for Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what you should do.
If a long-term and use this energy to play and cook gitars, you will be happy.
However, although television can provide short-term feelings of happiness, they may revoke long-termly.
Whoever has a long-term child, then, has a sufficed iPad, can take it away from the long time. However, it has not learned to interview or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he added: "The self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to interview, but also to get more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should zelebrize long.
We shouldn't even see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to make us feel free of constant A's and Technology exhaust.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be more long-term, but long-term is the worthless, incomplete desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are in truth only looking for a way, disabled and relaxing.
"In a surrounding area where we are permanently overstimated, it seems to be difficult to work when the warm is understood."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marihuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco is in Southeast Colorados for a proceeding before the court that will be already legal in this state: the possession of some less marihuana brokens and a pipe with which he smoke them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were arrested.
After finding the police officer Marihuana in the car, Orozco was presented for the possession of and outensiles - cavalerial delegates, each of which had a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court term.
"We're treated as criminals," like Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the unknown weeks after the State's decision to legalize small quantities of Marihuana for own use, the response depends on hundreds less smaller than the law than on the location.
Hundreds of injuries that turn around Marihuana are already allowed here and in the State of Washington, who approved similar measures.
The police members do not follow the growth over 21 years for small possessions, which will be legally placed as soon as the new law enters into force in the next weeks.
But state advocates in the conservative areas of Colorados have announced to continue persecuting existing marihuana delegates and still quoting people before the court.
At the same time, several cities, from the frontiers of Denvers to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, publicly licensed Marihuana businesses in their communities.
"This situation is so quickly developing that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, a police officer in Aurora, which is acquainted with Denver.
And the regulatory members of the State of Washington are also broken in the head.
They are waiting for a guideline assistance to establish a license system for production, production, dilution and sale of Droge and have a time limit until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, there is a view that Colorado is, in any case, for the majority of the states, as regards the regulation of Marihuana. There the drug was legalized only to medical purposes and then to its own consumption.
"Colorado has a stronger regulated market. Therefore, the State is good to orientate," says Brian E.
But it also admits that no place or system can do more than to serve in the sense of a cruel leadership.
"We have no true presentation that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, and thus forms the end of a grid zone where the State license system is not yet existing, but the property is legalized.
And inappropriate practical issues must be made at this time - such as the state standard of a "admissible access" to licensed Marihuana with the prohibition of cannabis businesses around 300 metres to schools, parks, games and children's control facilities.
"Nowhere will be more difficult to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's balling area," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently designed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his employees in Aurora a mail in which he explained that the State lawyer would not follow more than 21 years of marihuana in persons, and that the police would not strive immediately to punish these crimes.
Chief Oates suggests that the police continues to implement stated requirements for regulating medical marihuana producers and would continue to follow trademakers.
In Weld County in Northern Colorados, Ombudsman Ken Buck represents a stronger view.
After voting, he suggested that his authority would continue to follow cases of ownership of Marihuana, mainly to move consumers to the discharge.
Currently 119 persons must be responsible for the property of approximately 50 grams or less Marihuana, though many have been accused of other criminals.
"Our authority has the obligation to pursue crimes in which it was actually the time of criminal acts," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as Mesa County, where electors refused the Marihuana initiatives.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the country circle, shows awake for the possession of smaller quantities.
Lawyer official Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided to lay down all outstanding property procedures.
"I don't think I'm going to take my time to implement the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the electors in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to agree with the complexities of the government and legal system.
And the opposite reactions throughout the country, among local officers, promoted a deeply depth of duty in respect of the great green experiment at day.
It is a "cultural bar", says Sean McAllister, a jury lawyer from Denver, who represents a complaint before the court of Marihuana and acts as speakers for the national organization for the reform of Marihuanage.
"You have given such a large part of their life to persecute people criminally that they are still unable to accept the legalisation," he believes.
As the first states who treat the smaller quantities of Marihuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national patterns for legalization.
In order to prepare for an age of legal sales, monetary prosecutors and officials waited at the same time nervously for the instructions of the Federal Government, which would continue to treat the sale and building of Marihuana at federal levels as a penalty.
Preachers of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be rejected.
Despite several observable prisons of consumers and sellers of medical marihuanas, the Federal Government has placed the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States.
Kevin A. Sabet, former political officers of the Obama Government, believes that although criminal officers are probably not going to enter the doors in order to impose smaller amounts of them, they will be deceived to dump legal and publicly regulated Marihuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not expected to act by the associates.
Before the election day, some local community administrations authorised Moratories for new Marihuana businesses, though they could open only in about one year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the west, took a six-month prohibition, which probably will be forbidden next week.
"We don't want to be in a position in which we license someone and then stand on a federal level before a big problem," says Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment to the law.
We will judge what the congregation has decided and not what the State has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mocked out of Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It was always my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
My father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought for the world's greatest tomb, for a modern Greek symposium that encouraged the large columns of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my entertainment at the Worscester College end of the eighteen years - there I had been going to study story - I had packed my coffee again and thus brought the first scandale of my life.
My father's in tears together.
My friends were confused.
In the evening standard it called that I would have gone because I would have had a problem with that comilytons had sex in the neighborhood room.
Author A N Wilson explained shelmicly that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from protected bags.
But the truth was less amazing.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran because I was under systematic mobbing and trains.
Not about because of my rightly unusual name, or because I came from a school.
It was only one reason that I had been skicaned - a reason that in this famous way of lighting seemed so intense and grassful: My middle-stormed father Woodrow Wyatt was a significant adviser Margaret Thatchers and I was for the Conservative Party.
Why do I learn this right now?
Now, according to current reports, a new generation of students of those rights suffers under similar persecution.
The organized and growing hate on Tory students in Oxford has in the meantime developed such dimensions that a group of them requested the same balance protection in the last week, benefiting from schools, infirmants and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they will be "isolated actively, personally attacked and explained for unexpectedly".
They request a place in the Equalization Committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was deteriorated by a recent documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as an ex-Ric and Neonazis.
It was shown, among other things, by deputy Joe Cooke, the former president of the conservative Oxford University Student Unit, who walked in a Rolls-Royce, with silver-colored and silver-building firestock.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are considered as "Peacebooks for the introduction of Others".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday magazine: "There is a growing level of universities.
People believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without even telling us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historical student in Corpus Christ, who initiated the initiative for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "unappreciated". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designed president of the conservative student association of Oxford, said that she observed a growing decline to students of the rights.
"This constitutes a person for the intellectual discourse and the well-being of members," she says.
In my first week in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an unbelievable 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hate on the conservative party has reached his high point.
In the previous year, the University voted to grant no honor title to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to shortcomings in high school.
The atmosphere would even cause stalinists to scare.
In the first days of the first week, in the new students and in the tutors, I received a pleasure for the future events.
I made the experience that the Tutors did not only dulce up to Tory students, but even shared with joy.
Political issues such as the mountain workshop, the employment and the delay of the government of sanctions against the South African Apartheid regime found their way to the wooden rooms of Tutori.
In my first events, I should have translated French texts from the 18th century to English.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt, "report the first paragraph."
I was crazy with it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a cooking, and quite anxious.
"Did thatcher attachers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kissed.
In my eyes were wearing up.
"I propose that they take a few French hours in your free time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt touched me.
I got back in my room with a hanging head.
On this evening, I was alone at the college at dinner when someone easily pointed me on the rocks.
It was an English student of the second year named James, who represented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's like it is.
Everyone who is deceived to be Tory will be distressed.
It's worse enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is near, so it'll be worse for you.
Most of the Tory first seminars suggest to be attachers to the Labor party.
In a local pub, I tried to imagine later.
I thought I was not at all points with Mrs. Thatcher's opinion.
This trick should be shown as successful.
A starter in the philosophy, and economic section, who was ironicly visiting it as a conservative Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist wine."
You're disappointed.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was persuaded and crazy.
"How do Tories have sex?" asked me one.
They strike each other, isn't it?
I felt like homosexual had to be felt before the liberal law of the United States.
Would I ever have been able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to meet the same feelings just after the darkness breaks up?
Should I take the Labor party and press my natural inclinations?
The three years that stood before me thought before my spiritual eyes to a fire of honor and isolation.
The only tutor who recognized himself openly as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who had his seat at my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he consulted Thatcher in matters of external policy and had written talks for them.
He was just rare there.
He hated the place, found him provincially and smallly carryed him and refused him for his marxistic-deterministic history.
1997 he adopted a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to pick up between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge in close friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
In the fourteen years, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said smallly.
They would never do something like that, not in my town of dreaming tours.
Even my communist friends always put invasive manners on the day.
His laughing eyes were twisted.
Give the whole chance.
I'm sure you're just calling.
It would break my heart if you went.
Increased by my frequent trips to London, my emotional opposite became weaker.
One of my men's friends, too Tory's attachers, followed the pressure and refused his convictions.
A currency of a tutorium in the next week, when another historian student said seriously that I was "a enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was mystery before shame, I admitted that my parents had me subjected to a "madewater" and called her "an old trottel".
The easier was only a short time.
It was my father who killed the last nagel in my Oxford Care.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my hazards dropped up.
When they went, I packed a coffee and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You're pleased to call me an amazing slaughter.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer in a educational installation under such injury and wickedness.
And more tragic is that Oxford was - a university that has not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but hided up to this day behind an unworthy call of equality and thought freedom.
"Valentino presents the elegancy of famousness"
According to the "Valentino - Master of Couture", opened this week in London, ABC says with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worth the reservation of an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This has recognized the designer in the execution of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a huge retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture were compiled by "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with an unchanged Italian ac.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il ladies" Garavani, but who could not be written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always seen fascination for the fast and remote world of the Adel.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be seen until 3 March, there is a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most reading aristocracy, started by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, over the princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal reminders as the trophes of his social growth from the modesty macker in Voghera in North Italia to the Idol of the International Jetset.
To be in the Adel, it must not be deceived.
"They at least don't pull out their kits on your glorious teppich, as they do some beautiful famousness from the pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, both of them lived in the Alpes and were friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, nice and elegant guest provider.
"We all are happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," says the wife of "Heini" Thyssen, very friendly with forgotten beauty such as Marella Ag日i or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always predicted the elegancy of famousness.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a clothing of Valentino
Moreover, the argentin model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charism of the manufacturer.
For many years ago, we went to him at a watch at Piazza di Spagna in Rome to dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Any detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music was recognized, and its influence was observed.
"All invited people felt important and genuine," mentioned the "Top-Model", which started their running at the week of the Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of the face because his designs are artworks," she finally says..
Origin Mode View
The life of Garavani is not a story of dissession, rather of mutual love.
He loves people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the gallerys in Somerset House was converted into a glorious and 60 meters long step, which proposes a role exchange: the user takes the space of the model and goes to the runway to wonder a dreaming "audience", the master works of Valentino, such as the clothes that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristoteles Onassis, the costs that Monica Vitti carries in "La Notte", or a mantel of whale and leather, which belonged to Caiser Farah Diba.
In this public, the names of the Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the macker, 2006
Say these customers that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a wood, a hair, a west type "Gillette" and a jack from the herbst/Winter Collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I draw him all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty, fore," the ex herogin of Feria added.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have many lights and undermine the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and the leader of opinion at the Patricia della Giovapaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she was carrying a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed to finally have the age and the opportunity to have one of his night clothing...
The end of the 90s was so.
I bought my first Valentino clothes for a festival in the closure of my father, Prince Edouard de Line.
It was a red clothing with flew rock and a dragged surface with a decollete that makes name honor.
"It was a real dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino doesn't depend on it, his ownership is timeless," states this Italian aristocrane, which is between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires le日.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dinner clothes of the maker "with absolute concern", "for clothes are not only a clothes but also the reminders associated with".
The "King" of the
The great end of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding class of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Raga" (as the masker called his neighbors) were necessary to produce this elephant-colored seed clothing with perles, twelve different stickers and a four or half meters long swimming.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the Fachpress, this clothing was a milenstein in the Haute Couture end of the 20th century, "the back to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savoir-ster" of the elite, Valentino is now its best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest exposure of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre of Art et del Letre, exhausted with the honor legion, cumulated Garavani so many honors as each of the husbands of his customers.
"I always have his raffination, his rest, his pledged and perfect outside," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a Gala dinner in the Museum de Orsay.
He sat on the table of the Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was makellos; the time doesn't leave tracks on him."
And that's what a princess says...
The most difficult work in the world: the human job animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian Vulcan trainers set their lives and their health on the game when they 70 kilo swimming over the steel, rocky roads .
There are people whose work is the heavy, and others work wordly in the height.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who deserve their lives by getting swimming from the Vulkan Kawah Ijen on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To this, he must go down every day to the ground of his crater, where the flowing gas flows out of the earth in contact with the air.
After he broke big sweet stones that can weigh up to 70 kilo, he transports them into two bathrooms on his skulls over the broken roads of stone.
Although there are only 250 metres to the top of the Vulcan, which rises up to 2386 metres, the throats need more than 40 minutes for the growth in the skin crosspo, while they need to keep the balance and take care of their steps so that they do not exhaust and disturb.
You know that every step can cost their lives, as this has made a French tourist that has been thrown down to the cawah Ijen sticks years ago.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen deserve 5 eurocents for each kilo sweet that they deserve.
On the top, they bow up the way between the tourists who photographed them as circus jackets and run with the constantly heavy bowls three kilometers to the waage, which a mine company has set a little more below at a height of 1850 meters.
The company has been PT Candi Ngrimbia, who has used the events in Vulkan since 1960 and (not better said) his workers who pay 662 Indonesian Rupias (5 Eurocent) for each kilo sweet.
This will then cover the petrochemic industry for about 100,000 Rupies (83 Eurocents) because this mineral is spread every day and is used for the manufacture of strikewood, firework articles, cosmetics, dynamics and even for sugar.
"Besides usually 70 kg, we get about 46.000 Rupies (3.8 euros) for every way," Anto explains us, which normally makes three streets per day.
For each segment, he needs three hours, which he has completely created, but then has 138.000 Rupias (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
What a miserable recompense seems for such a strict unmanual effort, but the three-fold of what he would deserve with the field work.
"The daily payment of the mine workers here, where 15,000 Rupias (1,2 euros) are paid on the day and the average monthly revenue of two million Rupias (167 euros) is very high," states the trainer who is previously murdered on the tourist island Bali.
There he deserved 75,000 Rupias (6,2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and it is for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sweet: "I have married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduists, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often buying and his eyes are increasing because of the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life on Kawah Ien on the game, whose sweet has already left his first tracks, although he has covered his face with a mask and special brilliant.
Anto has astma, breathing with difficulty, often stuck and his eyes are driven because of the toxic gas from the Vulcan.
This is the price he needs to pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I'll work here for two years because I want to open a load or learn Spanish or French," he promises in one more than just acceptable English.
This sympathic and intelligent, but a young man punished from life could work as tourist leader, Kellner or to receive a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a tragedy.
He divides a disturbing wooden hole with other trainers and stands up every morning at two hours, because the sweet also flows night, where his characteristics of yellow color in darkness lightly.
With the shadows, he grows up in the light of a small stirring lamp to Helm, which he has bought from his own money, into the crater.
Nearly 400 trainers are loading the cowbs on the ground with swine on their rocks.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanized the weight loss to save costs, and offers to the trainers who work on their own account and are paid by weight no equipment.
You do not receive any share in the 30,000 Rupies (2.5 euros) awards per camera, which the guards of this natural park require from the tourists who come to photograph the Vulcan and the human tragedy.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protests Maduzin, a suitable 42-year-old trainer, who has been three years since the school is left at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to get up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, "as long as it goes", because he has lost the money for his three children in the age of 10 to 18 years.
I'm not going to run, I'll die here because the Vulcan was my whole life.
Even if the sweet burns the cow and jumps the eyes when the wind turns suddenly and the mine workers in the thick pillars that rise up from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course, except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blasses on the woods that have been shaken by the weight of the cow.
With the corb on back, Oneinik is only in the ability to 50 kg with 53 years.
Each day he and his companions break 15 tonnes of silver from the Vulcan, transported by three LKWs through a cattle path between the woods to the camp in Tamansari in 18 km away.
"I'm not going to run, I'll die here because the Vulkan was my whole life," explains Uninik, when he opens his mouth far, in which some teeth missed.
From his five children, the elders with his 30 years also as swimming trainers.
The time is lost, but the poverty keeps generation on generation in one of the most heavy professions of the world: those who work as human burden on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore had babies to save the economy
The Singapores are guilty of no children, to the cars, stress, and the costs of immobility and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfil our citizen's obligation and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of a advertising for Minzbons, but, however, - or just because, they were in Singapore at the beginning of this year to a viral video on YouTube.
The seeds are part of a rapper song, the local language such as "shoeping" will be a "bao" (laib) in the ovens to make it fun over the lower birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising formula BBH, which has turned the video, finds the hope that the advertising pot reaches a pleasant way to focus on the problem.
His creative leader Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their "national obligation".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst of the world, so we realized that it was a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the Government tried many things, such as the confusion of parfums with pheromons or the organization of speed-dating dinners (fast flirts).
Maybe many of these ideas were creative, but they were not forced to succeed.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as possible to cope with this problem, such as composition of a rap?
1.2 Children
Who doesn't easily take this topic is the Government of Singapore.
Each year, it issues $1.300 for political measures to encourage the citizens to get more children.
A Package of the Government for Married and Parents is granted up to 15,000 per child, extends the maternal permit and distributes tax advantages.
But everything had little success until now.
Singapore is a richer, higher city state in Southeast Asia, which is also for the conservatism of its rulers and its strike social controls.
According to his national population, the rate of birth is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapores get children anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Family and Marriage Policy of the National People's Participants, says that this was based on a "better education" and "creasing kar' accounts".
"This has enabled people to be married and to make a family essentially more options for life objectives and priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social events have reached the number of individuals and the submarine of the wedding and birth resulting in the reduction of the rate of birth in Singapore.
A immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigrants in order to combat the decreasing of the population has led to resentiments in the local population.
In Singapore, there are web pages where the nearly cashed xenophobie flows against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized to keep the wages low and not integrated.
The increase in immigration will also be considered as one of the reasons why the Governing Party in Singapore has achieved its worst choice results since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
Singapore also shows unexpected consequences as the falling rate of birth on the economic growth of a nation, tax income, health costs and immigration policy.
The Government is trying to demonstrate that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already been affected by the apartments.
The Civil Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments which are "shaches" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a residence area of 46 square metres and show a great success in purchasing.
However, there is anxiety that they can promote the lifestyle of the one who is alone, and that they fear the buildings of building a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Immobiliary Form EL, says that his "shooting shots" is far more faster than bigger living units.
They are so europar, and the units are faster at days and even weeks than the biggest living units.
This leads to that they are much better for our Cash flow.
However, the new standards provide clearer guidelines to developers, which had previously been put into the way to build too many small residence units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way to increase the national birth rates, the talks with the Singapores who work in the financial quarter are to assume that they will not have a great effect.
"The people are strongly disappointed, the apartments and the education are also cruel, therefore it is exhausted by many," says a young manager.
Children can get others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead to their cars, stress and costs for property and education as a reason why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singapores have the last word when they are about to get children - the government can still do so much.
Offline's offline is private
Sphere
According to the dictionary, it is the property of the privacy or "the area of life, where protecting from any kind of mixture".
What is private for someone under 16 years?
How is this definition applied to its whole day and social networks?
Does he understand the situations that he is exposed to when he makes situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five youths between 10 and 15 years of age who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term with " something very own" at personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets I would not give in a post" says the 10-year old Jorge at trying to declare the importance of "private" in web pages such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has passed over two years of account.
"It's very confidential secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he's occupied.
On FB I load beautiful images or images of games up.
I'm also spending my time with known people.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not of me, or of someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is clear about that it is wrong to write area photos, of naked, of crimes, or reasonable or violent comments.
Jorge assures us to know 35 friends he has in the FBI and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I joined Twitter to express and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I'm just putting them up" he adds.
"The social networks are entertainable, I can quickly talk to relatives in the remote or friends," he advises.
He asked that he would never accept an invitation of an unknown.
Even if someone accepts a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he allows 20 of the people he has learned his friend list.
"This doesn't scare me because we have something common, for example music," he advises.
According to the boy, no one has made him an anxiety or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If anyone disturbs me or asks me, I'll just remove him from my user account" he gives it.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy's experiences are not known today as Cyberbullying.
The known friend of a friend was printed in a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
"He never learned who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He's just made it private."
Afterwards, he makes a series of steps to configure a user account safe.
In the subdivision to Jorge, this boy would upload photos of known persons in irrelevant or penal situations.
Yeah, I would do that if he's unsympatic or I want to kill him one.
"But I know this is Cyberbullying," he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with high school in education and learning, believes that to guide children and youths, it must be understood to inform the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a media for search for information; with the appearance of these pages, the game rules have changed," she says.
Porras states that the Academic Marc Prensky, who has a Master Title in Padagogics at the Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" has made these terms for the adherence of the phhenomen.
The Digital Natives are they, children and youths who are raised up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that they have to teach where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "for we ask them to have a defined criteria on what it is spread, published or said, and this is in an age where it is not sufficient for it."
"They must also be choiceful if they are the most important to be able to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," he added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and youths is to ask questions that bring them to think.
"To say that they don't have to do it, it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why then do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Have you previously asked the others about authorisation when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: should everyone know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to give them understanding that they have to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"A man outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitor
Stuardo Guardia, University Professor, Basic Schooler and Educational Advisers, comments that it is unrelevant that parents are carefully reading the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all sections, they have solid bases to talk to their children about the importance of the importance of the employment of a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publicly" he explains.
According to Guardia, children must be reminded of the lection "Do not talk to strangers".
End of the spring meeting of the Unsur without publishing the Declaration of Lima
The sixth meeting of the presidents of the Union of South America N° (Unasur) has been completed today in Peru without publishing the Declaration of Lima, which was previously announced and theoretically should be subjected to the seven present governments.
Efe tried to get access to the subheaded document at the VI Orderal Meeting of the State and Government Heads of the Unsur. Sources in the State and Presidency Chance began to tell them that it would be translated after the clausur, however, stated that it would be published at a certain time on the Peruanian Government's website.
In the context of the text, they suggested that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented to the press in short statements.
The access of journalists to information on the gipfel meeting was limited at any time.
Only the picture of the president's meeting in the pressury has been translated without sound with the "private session, restricted audio" report.
The few information circulated among the journalists were received by the press speakers of some of the governments of the Unsur at the meeting, but not by the Peruan press speaker.
The only document that was spread during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which showed in the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media unappreciation that requested more information.
Afterward, the President of Peru sent to the media a mail with the "concluding clothes" of the Gipfel meeting, but it was Humala's Declaration, not the official document for the conclusion of the Gipfel Meeting.
In October last, Peru was the guest of the III. Gipfels of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and at this occasion, despite the press, the so-called claim of Lima, which was previously announced, was also little published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published on Wednesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruanian authorities emphasized that the information systems for journalists would be available, but they had highly limited access to information.
It also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru, which was sentenced by the Court of Justice of the Hague, which introduced a border conflict between both countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and assured that they would adopt the decision of the IGH starting in Haag on Monday, in the process that Lima started against Santiago to listen to both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we currently submit to this International Court of Justice," Humala said together with the Chilean opposite.
"Chile was, it was, and remains a country that holds up international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for conflicts, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts," f.Pinnera added and welcomed Humala with a hand pressure before the two countries.
The action of both Presidents that they would submit to the IGH was carried out after Cookie, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which believed that it was a serious mistake, made a complaint against the IGH Agreement of Bogotá, which was acceptable to submit to the judgments of this international court.
At gipfel meetings, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the Unsur since 2011 after his President Fernando Lugo has been released, did not participate in the meeting.
The guest President Ollanta Humala opened the discussions on the morning and ended the gipfel meeting shortly after midnight in Lima.
The State's oversight was leaving the final document, in which it notified that 16 decisions were taken and the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries were set on a total investment amount of 17 billion.
He said that the countries of the Unsur will "make significant steps towards the goal of a South American Civility, to which we extend the decisions on sustainable rights".
He noted that measures would be proposed to " improve cooperation in combating uncertainty in the cities and the organised, cross-border crimes, and measures to improve access to medicines and to the Internet to low prices in all South America areas and to act together and in the case of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) cannot accept triumphing moves but should serve to expand our production performance and to show our people a better future," add Humala.
"We have decided to give a series of 31 emblem projects the priority to improve the space connections in South America, especially in rural and border areas... and thus unify our countries and make new economic forms," said the Peruanian President in a reading statement.
These projects would also be five peruanians who were located on the axes of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide any more details.
The final document also refers to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election in this country serves for its recovery to the Union of South America N°", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for the Latin America to remain a integrated region for welfare and peace and with good neighborhood relations was another aspect that was pointed out in the meeting.
In this regard, President of Ko Papalia, Juan Manuel Santos, before his participation to the regional meeting, said that he expected a meeting with Others against Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday, to treat the maritime conflict after a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
"I may be to meet President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will check all these ways - they are not exclusively, and also make the Nicaragua Agreement needed talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to say to the President Ortega that we will be civilised and treated as respectful as possible," adds Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present in the receipt of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the spring meeting, the Defence Minister of the Block also met in the preliminary way to deal with the 2013 action plan, in which the dialogue and consciousness in relation to the defence of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Copenhagen, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even if the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the president at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn about the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, noticed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, "South America can really learn something from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the sixth meeting of the presidents of the Union of South America (Unasur), located in Lima, explained to the public television in Peru that the Europeans were "in the second world war and in other negotiations" and "then practically a father country".
In this regard, he defended the project to create a South American State citizenship forwarding the Member States of the Unsur.
"The freedom of citizens and workers in all South America countries must be achieved, as this is already in the other community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that strive to return to the past," he warned.
The President Ecuador also proposed the restructuring of the United States (OEA) under the default to reduce the impact of the angelsic states and to take into account those who have understood the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in contrast, we always submit to the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as an example of the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not sustain this decision because he had not delivered his principles but had followed his "deep democratic values and views of human rights".
He adds that it has given "based disappointments that ascense is delivered to a third country and that its procedure would not be fulfilled."
He also criticized the Swedish justice requested by him to submit an audience in the State territory for a pleasant sexual delegate, while "the Swedish legal pronouncement allows this through a video conference that could have been conducted through the Ecuadors message in London."
Correa explained that it was evident that the health and the psychical condition of asange would affect.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our message, but the lawyer has informed me that he has a easy problem with the longs, but not a serious thing," said Ecuadors.
However, it consists that he takes physical and mental damage because he is captured in a close room and can't carry out physical exercises in freedom.
"It would affect the health of everyone," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution for the asylum, the asing has been granted in the Ecuadors message in London since June, which is a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of British, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that it had been given with London to find a solution for the integrated factors of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, but we do not refer to this case, but it has made constant talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of British, Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer of Asange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a series of procedures at various instances," he explained.
And "if British gives this letter tomorrow, this is my opinion."
And when Sweden, Mr. Assange, asked the Ecuadors message in London or about Skype, how the Swedish jurisprudence allows and has been made in other cases, if the problem is done.
Correa used the opportunity to visit himself as a defensor of the freedom of press and said that what he doesn't tolerate, "the mediacy, the bad intentions and the lies that disappoint the free opinion."
"The biggest enemies of the freedom of pressure are not the wicked and perverse, but the bad journalists who strive to win and pressure," he said.
In this sense, he wished that Ecuador was not anymore controlled by such journalists and not by the banks or the Hegemonic and the citizens' countries, and predicted that in a re-electing, he would "deepen the revolution to continue the way to this right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Veto against Paraguay in the Unsur at least until its next election, he argued that the organ must "reserve hart and no opportunity and no legally clothed State strategy" because "the legitimity of the democracy in Paraguay has been zerse-formed".
The President Ecuadors also considers the desire of his co-law, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate the marine borders between the two countries, now and in accordance with the sentence of the International Court of Justice of Den Haag, which promoted the Maritime State of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua.
Currently this judgment is not implemented.
This is a problem between a South-American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in a common way.
They must be treated completely so that you can overcome them and look forward.
Similarly, he trusted in a good conclusion of the fights on the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that " it is right for Latin America to call international institutions when both countries are committed to the judgment, even if it is very hard."
As regards the possibility that he is candidate for the next presidency elections in Ecuador to achieve his mandate, he suggested that he looks "with a lot of optimism and joy, despite sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would get away from the political life.
Power has never personally interested me, but in such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this social economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was who guaranteed this probably victory, therefore I must follow this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as a president, then I'll get back from the public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"This is decided," he explained.
Correa also refers to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolas Madura, and he told me that he had traveled for a planned, routineous treatment there, and that would expect him to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a residue in the health state of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Governing Boss today participated in Lima on the sixth meeting of the South American State and Government heads of the Union (Unasur) which was completed by calling for a regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause for a death for AIDS today is too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was conducted the result of the investigation: HIV.
"It was as if a bomb had been involved," he said about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the Ar tried to "smoke" without a recognible success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such use that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is, of course, one of the elderly patients of the HIV unity of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio le日 with human immunity virus (HIV) since 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s when there were many doubts, few treatment opportunities and more Stigmata.
At that time, the director of a IMSS clinic avoided to decide, "for it led to a sackgase."
At that time, AIDS was a synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with life quality.
However, many people still come to the clinic who don't know anything about their illness and in which the virus has already caused damage and has created their immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the world’s AIDS appears, which is after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes the treatment timely and the survival of the general population is exactly equal," explained by the leader of the HCG HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was based on a scientific publication in April this year.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the students since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a mortal judgement, but the years of survival and quality of life by the degree of immune system of persons at the beginning of treatment, and that they have greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years at a number of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a number of 500 CD4.
Simplified, the above expressions mean that whoever receives HIV diagnosis during 25 years can be "freely 75 years as long as he is under control", said this expert.
In order to correctly fix this progress, it must be reminded that the life expectation of Mexico today is average of 76 years.
Even if death has been decreased in the past years (in Mexico, the number of persons who die in AIDS has been decreased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNUSIDA’s annual report), however, it is true that since the appearance of AIDS 60% of patients died in the national database.
Only in Jalisco died in 2011 255 people, and until May this year there are 187 death cases; however, it is assured that since 2005 there is universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
So why do people still die?
- I think the problem is not access to the treatment.
This is my opinion, and that's in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any issues of supply in the medicines. The problem is that people are in a far advanced state because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in very late phases of disease.
He makes a shocking statement: "9 of the patients come to us if they already have a joint infection. To influence the global death, early diagnosis is needed, therefore, to offer massive recognition tests for all people in which this is necessary."
This proposal agrees with the experts and officers of the Council Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on Aids Evitation in Jalisco) and with the patients such as Fabrizio, who performed his test at a private lab, and this is for the only reason that a friend made him, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even the Caposi Sarkom (a cancer tumor), which is one of the usual complexity.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I prefer to place three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, treat sports and take the medicines.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, undertake much, have an active, but responsible sex life, I care for my health and the other person," Fabrizio recalls, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate those who today have a worldwide AIDS day.
They should do the test when they belong to a risk group. If they know that they are HIV-essential, better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibility as all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condom behind the ladentic
Among the health programmes and the simple citizen, there are big leakers, says Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who accepted HIV.
And the most important is the prevention.
In certain places, "the distribution of condoms was actually added; before they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Youths include risks for new infections.
"Why do you need this?" is a broad-speed question of social workers, the orientation staff in schools, the employees in apothechics and the health system that young people do not want to deal with.
He proposed to resume this ineffective distribution; the condoms should be not only behind the ladentic but also in households in public toilets of institutions that are often visited by youths.
It should not promote promiscuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered to the question whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like this; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who have already exercised sexual activity," he said on the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (1.2.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is nationally seen at the 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases and 13.
92% of the inflammation occur through sexual traffic, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 500,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people that don't know for each registered case.
After the United States Professional Court has concluded a sentence that does not recognize the restructuring of the commitments of the Vitro Group reached by a trade competition in Mexico, there will be an unrealistic case of preliminary presentation for each national company with neighbourhood discharges in the neighborhood.
Thus, the procedures for survival of companies that allow mexican laws are not valid in the country of Stars and Stripes in contrast to international agreements.
In the practice, the recognition of the sentence made on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Court of Justice in Bancarrotas for the North District in Texas leads to that Mexican enterprises have been helplessly excluded from their own ownership on the side of the Bravo Stress.
However, the decision opens the largest steel manufacturer in Mexico door and gate to call the head of the United States for three inconsistencies.
As the judge of the matter points out that the believers must be subject to the concurrence law of the United States, the Court of Procedure of Fifth Circuit with a seat in New Orleans states that it is the main procedure for the trade competition treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for paying incapacity of companies with a transnational profile is not .
In fact, for this purpose, the model law of the United States N° was created for the unity of international trade law, and the American Law Institute was established as a striker.
Secondly, the sentence states that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the commitments in the competition mass of Vitro with their mother company, the majority necessary for restructuring commitments would not have been achieved.
However, this opportunity is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was authorised.
There are a half-dozen examples, including Agrimex and Commercial Mexico, whose commitments under the group undertaken by Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also appropriate that, after the voices of the votes, the believers of Vitro, the believers who complained against Vitro against the courts of the United States, including the Geier Funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, had not reached majority.
The vote would have passed 45 Pro against 37 Pro.
This shall not be taken into account by the Court of Procedure.
On the other hand, Vitro has been guilty of his difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the large economic crisis in the United States, which has granted battles to the country.
For this reason, the family González Sada is repeated to the same professional court in order to take place the vote in the plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them were voting.
In the case of that case, the Cerciorare appeal will be introduced to the Secretary-General who requests the review of the procedure by an institution.
In this case, the Court has made a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura friendus curiae (Freund of the Court), in which the procedure carried out by Vitro is described in accordance with the Law on Trade Concurrence, and in which it is noted that it had been held in line with the agreements under the two countries to meet the Chapter 15 of the United States Concurrence Act.
It is noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for International Trade, i.e. the rules for the cases of cross-border payment incapacity, which guarantee the equality of debtors and believers.
Double carambols: a battle for Vitro and for the country.
General Bi
After the publications by the Mexican Air Transport facilities against the former owner Gaston Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a disgusting administration, have not been advanced for several months, the Association Sèoal de Pilotos Aviadores has finally progressed.
Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now introduced a penalty procedure against the National Bank and Value Paper Commission, which will prevent justice.
Following that, the supervisory responsible systematicly refused to inform the Republic’s main administration of one transaction carried out by the undertaking to remove from the bank F/589 of the Bank IXE's account Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of actions of the ↓adora Professional de Hotels (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main actor of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is converted
At a meeting on the weekend at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environments, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a wide front to resist the exhibition of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we talk about a huge sale and distribution area in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country on the side of the wall, in addition to a residence area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the preliminary case, Canacintra (the national room of the processing industry) has reached to join the governments in the south-east in order to resist the monumental establishment that destroyed the areas that were partly destroyed and represented the mother of all the threats of the industry.
♪ TA's dead
Since the Government of a request of the Senate to declare the conditions and circumstances of the Mexican Messenger in Japan undergoing the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement, which is under the English reduction TA, the matter has already been dealt with in accordance with the Mexican Institute for intellectual property.
As you know, these measures have been carried out, despite the Senate had made the possibility without consideration, because he considered them as a violation against the free opinion in the social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bummler of the basketball, Hector "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the corb sport for more than 60 years and has prepared the whole world.
A few in Puerto Rico have a so large spiritual collection of the history of the basketball of the country like hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound by a scragging case in 2008 to the Rollchair, Rexes was a 6-year part of this sport, if it were players of lower classs, players of the first national liga, powerful and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or the president of the Basketball Board.
"My life I have set many guards in the basketball, even several at the same time, when I was the president of the BSN, the leader of the National Management and the President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes had been in the house of Primera Hora in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't survive with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long kare and testify them.
Bayamon in the heart
The most emotional reminders are those who at his time remind the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year-old Jubileum as a business leader or business leader of the club.
"That were my best years I enjoyed mostly because I had to be part of eight masterships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a business leader, a business leader or a Tra.
There were many full years, the five masterships after each other from 1971 to 1975.
And then I dismissed with a mastership in 1981, the year of the debt of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
Since then, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who was placed here as a tragedy and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very powerful and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freewearth specialist Raymond Gausse, who was one of our best advertisers.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a mastership for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another.
The Mastership of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the band in 1988.
At that time, he suggested to enjoy his performances and those of Mincy in the national community.
I still know when we wined the first time in the preolympical tour in Mexico against the United States.
Afterwards, the World Mastership 1990, where we set the fourth place, what would Bronze should be if not this Canadian District Judge, who let us repeat the last game road for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the World Mastership 1990 the best nationality you ever saw?
It belongs to the best, as well as those who won at the Olympide 2004 against the dream team.
But my favorite is the manhood of the Pan-American games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and offered a fight to the United States team, as when they won us in the World Mastership Bronze.
In that mastership, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz) were there, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, which could not be with them because of a gender damage in 1990.
A man who may not have been the best of personalities with which we have won a golden medaille and prepared us great joy was those of the preolympic tourist in 1995 in Newquen, Argentina.
With players such as Canito Neves, Pablo Alice and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the locked players because of the events on the pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won every predict of the Gold Media.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was without doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tours are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his running in the different bodys in which he has played.
Who was the best tragedy from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a series of good treasures such as Julio Toro, Flor Melléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the boy's work of Leo Arrill.
What do you think you're the best you've reached in the band?
I was part of the latest era of the nationality from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 90s to 17 men in a season.
What else are you gonna do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalization of the below category.
That boys in Ponce, for example, just play in their territory, and only in the national playoffs are taking places from other corners of the island.
Today, children do unnecessaryly many travels and games.
At least I see the result of the previously written training and course for Tra's, table-of-of-shore and judges.
I'm proud of it.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and leave and go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role than John Ross Ewing, better than "J.R". in the "Dallas" TV series, where he played a screwful, homely and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oilmagnat J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" has become a symbol of the happiness of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new staff of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complication, according to a press report of the family to the Family by Warner Bros., Production of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his loved city of birth, Dallas, where he played the iconic role that most of his family," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the festival.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas' hospital, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loved and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was a original person and lived life in full moves," Gray explained in a message.
Hagman was deceived in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over years.
1995 a bad tumor was found in his liver, and he was undergone a transplant.
In the years ago "Dallas" Hagman was a nice man in television in the 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Appealing Jeannie" of the NBC TV.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is placed on his head when he met an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him home.
He was also a representative of two comedians, which were only a short time, such as the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His kino works belonged to the critical roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his mastery interpretation of the exciting J.R., who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the Ewing Clan and other figures in its area was spread from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising "Who shot on J.R.?", expected to create an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, leaded to a international speculation, and millions were injured in households.
In this way, the series reached a review record at that time.
When the answer was made in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by average 41 million viewers that "Dallas" converted into the second of the most seen entertainment programme since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Christian, the weakest of J.R. (interpretered by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had weakened her and threatened her to be prostituted if she didn't leave the city, but others also had reasons to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, unreplaceable man with a charismatic bed: a sustainable businessman and an unfaithful husband who then tried to show his wife sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on the burst of J.R.," Hagman said 1988.
It should be called "This is the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, representative of the original series, recalled to Hagman on Friday as a "great personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and unforgettable for millions of worshippers in the world and remains in our hearts those who had the happiness to know him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new series of "Dallas" were extracted a few months ago with great success in the TNT television channel.
The insertion of five chapters for the second staff was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, informed the sender.
From warner or TNT there was no immediate claim to how Hagmann's loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the player and song Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "Southificafic" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a youth when she got Larry during her marriage with a lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his lucky at the theater pillars in New York at the beginning of the 50s, then served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he learned to meet the young designer Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived a long time in the Californian city Malibu, where many famous places have their residence.
2001 he entitled his memories "Hello Darlin: Number (and absolutely true) talks about My life".
"I didn't write anything of which I thought it could damage someone or affect him in any way," said the press press in his time.
After hepatic transplantation, he placed himself for livers and was voluntary in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations come and then," he explained 1996.
I want to comfort them, like, "no, it's a little unbequem for the first time, but it'll be good for you."
Similarly, he took part in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studys the "End of the World"
Each week, students investigate Apocalyptic subjects such as the atom war, zombies, virus and keime and global heating.
Each semester, when the religious professor decided to keep a course over the end of the world, knew that he had an inconsistent angelhaken: the end of the "long backward account" of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many believed that it was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the zeer-eric Hurrikan Sandy, some of whom some were "deudarmageddon" and a growing conflict under Israel's participation, the place where the Christian theoryers believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the Apocalyptic most semester that has ever been," Charmé said this week to students at the University of Rutgers' Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyses what has happened today in the world, as if we had been removed from 30 days, this would be a real-period.
And he reminds that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers this semester, which should be the last in the history course over the "End of the world".
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Medien, Culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students investigate Apocalyptic subjects such as the atom war, zombies, virus and keime and global heating.
"We analyze why these ideas spread up with time," he said, as well as how hypothetic scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could be destroyed.
This month, the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they were compared to the real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the Professor for Latin American History Matthew Reë and his colleague Amara Solari, designed a team to offer a team with the fair name "The end of the world".
"We don't take 2012 so that we can always keep the option to stop the course again, for the case that the world doesn't be undergone," said Re日.
Despite the "previous step" students must study, create projects and participate in final tests.
In Penn State, the final test is carried out at the earlier night of the Apocalypse, therefore the students do not have any other chance than "to the night, where the world is going to end," Re日 said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there was no place anymore," Re said about his course for students with a high average, who had 35 students.
We received e-mails from students who asked if they were still free.
Students assure their side that the rate is counted to the interested ones.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to treat themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers' chamber for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is only a question of comfort or failure.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and hospitals explains that all apocalyptic films have been seen.
"I have never heard anything about a teaching where this is learned," he advised.
I enjoy it.
But no one of the students concerned - and less than one of the professors - said to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of Mayas, and in some way we discred them," said Julie Zeglen, student in Temple last year, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Reʹ.
However, he notes that western society contains an apocalyptic existence that returns several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the predictment of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculate.
"Instead, people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly in the English speaking world of the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor of the University of La Salle, who teaches the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question if he would know a course about the "End of the world".
"The Philippines don't share at the end of the world," he wrote as an inspiration to a exception of an instance.
We have a payment from Daddy.
Re® pointed out that over the years the last days were spoken by the Court, and said that, if the 21 December doesn't matter, "the people immediately think of a new date" or they philosophed that the 21 December of the beginning of a seven-year period was the end of the world.
Students and professors easily take this date.
Many said they wanted to celebrate about "the end of the world".
"I may call a few friends to let us laugh together," Samira Ford said, a 20-year-old student for communication.
