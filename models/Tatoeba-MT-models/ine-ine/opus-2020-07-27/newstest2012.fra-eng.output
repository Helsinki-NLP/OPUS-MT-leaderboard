Parliament has not made the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has, in the framework of a amendment to criminal law, the draft cancellation of paragraph on the accusation of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of opposition.
In second read, the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Timosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years of prison for concluding an unnecessary priority agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
Judgment is not definitive and the Court shall establish the call for the sentence in December.
Tymosenko qualified the judgment of the regime of political vengeance and caused a process of partiality suspicion of the court also in the west.
The draft of the sentence of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on which the former Prime Minister was condemned, was signed by 147 members.
It would have had 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
Libyan freedom or rebellion has already gained it.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the wilderness and without him the war has ended.
The winners are still determined.
As it is usual in the region, election winners are islamists, but it is moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of the Charia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without criminality because for a flight we're cutting the hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, the unrespectives of her faith are passive of capital penalty...
It is the Coran who will join the dictator's personality the company composed of opposed tribes.
In Libya will rule such a order as we can't represent it and as we would certainly not like.
But our way of life is not unique, not objectively the best, and it would probably not be beneficial for the Libyans.
It is especially surprising that islamist wars have accepted help with confidential dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not a American general who led NATO's stripes, but God, whose size they would be to each attack.
So when it's looking for winners in Libya, the o'o's not part of it
We participated in the tirs, served islam and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political covenant without any benefit.
According to the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militaryly occupied with Libya.
There is therefore no problem for the locals to get out of "crossed".
It is that without the ground, oil companies will easily access to the Libyan Black Gold.
Perhaps not as much as the oea can finally benefit from desinteressed protection of human rights.
As soon as we prevent these appets from the charia.
A new crisis era begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the viewer of investors.
A return of statistics has passed on Wednesday on Europe.
Each of the states has made the information related to the PIB for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stepped this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The obligatory market struggle all records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistics of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have soon seen their economic development visions for the third quarter.
German PIB has an estimated growth of 0.5%, France's 0.4%.
The two countries had the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better placed than expected (instead of 0.3% growth in place of 0.1%), however, France decreased by 0.1% (that was the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy increased by 1.5% during the third quarter.
However, the BDP has staged and maintained the Czech Statistics Office is confirmed that the economic growth is a progressive decrease.
The results are worse than the analysis previews.
The most important events:
The Czech economic growth was 1.5% during the third quarter, but the last trimester staged.
In the third quarter, the German economy had a growth of 0.5% of the estimated and revised data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union had an increase of 0.2% between July and September in comparison to the quarter, which corresponds to the analystes planned.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2%.
The performance of the ten-year obligations is 28.45%
The performance of Spain and Italy's obligations are striking to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, ↓, etc.
The performance of the Czech obligations remains lower than 4% while the situation is empire in the region.
Votes are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
Czechs have been qualified for EURO.
They won at Montenegro 1:0 and celebrated the qualification for 200 million
The representation of the football has succeeded in the most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won by the super Cech and the guard Peter Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football was nicely defended with a lot of chance in the second part of its qualification and will not miss Europe's championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed reporting.
No special exciting during the first part and a large part of chance for the second.
The Czech representation also won by the super Cech and the hero Peter Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its qualification at the campionship of Europe.
Montenegros were under pressure until the second part due to a precise Czech defence.
The victories of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who had two chances to mark a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech, the Czech representation will not be absent to the campionship of Europe next year, and more than 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first minutes we played a football guer.
The two teams were hard to get up combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers has not reached the Czech defence that has directly responded to the long courses even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready for the nuclear programme of their country.
They created a human bottle
Some hundred students from high schools have created a human bottle around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear programme of their country with the possibility of a Israeli assault.
Students began to pray at midnight before the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
Some hundred students at the University of Spain have created a march of human buckle around the nuclear centre of Spain, where the ur is transformed.
They thus expressed openly that they would defend the nuclear programme of their country to the danger of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) found in its latest information that Iran did not stop strengthening its nuclear weapons.
In Israel, a possible attack of Iranian nuclear institutions is stated.
Students began to pray at midnight before the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose goal would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives would be not only Ispahan but also the Natanz site where the ur is rich.
The feeding of an obesite child: don't take a little dinner and take a carcutery for dinner
More than one third of children from 9 to 13 years have overweight problems, 9% of the schools have weight over the average and 5% are obess.
As the current research shows, obesity children come from families who have a bad life.
This reveals how important the environment in which human being and the models around it are.
In the obessed children's tables, for example, the carcutery is 50% more often than in normal weight children's families.
19% of the obesity had breakfast at dinner; the investigation carried out with an action of "The Obsesity is not a hazard"
In smaller families sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most today's schools - only 15% answered that at least once a week parents have found time for active movement.
Inquiry conducted on 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and attended 900 primary schools in Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "The Obsesity is not a hazard", supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever Society.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 × sixth to the third have been registered in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children in overweight, even obesity, is the absent of proper food and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the questioned children indicate, for example, to eat five times a day of dinner - dinner - eating, which is a basic principle of good food," indicates one of the results of the investigation.
Without breakfast and charcostery at dinner
Experts focus on the fact that in order to have a healthy development, some basic details such as a small breakfast at the same time are needed.
In Czechland only 23% of the families eat at the same time.
In most of the families each takes his little dinner alone.
And the worst that has been raised is that one tenth of the population does not take all the breakfast.
However, the little breakfast is the basis for a good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obessed children, more frequently consumption of malicious feet is consumed.
Almost every - without speaking of weight - drinks sugar drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned are regularly sporting, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the investigation allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare their own food from proposed opportunities to their own go and their personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years are far from the plan of healthy food."
Among their preferred places there are many kidneys, meat and sugars.
"The most alarmant is, in particular, a large preference for sugar limonates," it is indicated in the results of the investigation.
For dinner, these are the pieces that took the first place right before the white meat.
Children did not all want feculents, and the preference for fish and feed was very low.
Chief on Health
The investigation also showed that children are willing to change their habits since they receive ad hoc information.
"When a group of participants in the investigation checked the questionnaire after the "Observation is not a hazard" session, it was seen to a well-determined will to go to healthy food," the results of the investigation indicated.
The most important was, for example, regarding sugar limonates because children began to give the preference to consumption water.
Children most often covered the white meat and fish as the main platform on the questionnaire and reduced sugar plates and "knedliky" (check speciality of bread-feed bullets or ground pumps).
The list must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for the lists, I was a little angry for the fact that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I didn't think of what would happen afterward.
The exhibitions of three professionals of speciality, personal accommodation and a seminar on what is going on.
And it'll be worse.
More we draw close to final reviews and more we expect practical practices and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturday and Sunday, it's actually "booted".
This time, we have with Alenka's guide (in the course there is no boy) treated how to clothe the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a little cow, another one a boy body, without a special corbe, another of the overweight.
The list must know how optically reducing wide arms, extending a hair or raising the needed corbs.
So we have come to be nicely highlighting the personhood and also not clothing too seen women types such as Jennifer Lopez with a strong poitrine and pronogated hanches and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the hanches in such a way that shops or bottles do not pass at all, it is worth to make it in measure.
And you won't regret him because the habit that falls impecc. is inestimable.
In a jupe on measure, you will feel much better than in that that that slides permanently, rulls and doesn't hold on the cinture and soon.
For those who have a man's appearance, there can be a Tucker's accommodation, with cut tissues, or a lot of broderies.
Of course, there are many examples of different appearances, and I am glad that I have all the week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that you do what I have to do at home there is too much.
Each stage has received a collective clothing for day and evening.
We must take into consideration the current appearance, the type of personality and its appearance.
I'd have to "made" Miranda Kerr, which maybe you know of the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
In the background of me, it makes me pleasure, because it's better than clothing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who took almost 100 kg of the last time (do not take my statement, svp, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and cut from magazines or search on the Internet, print and work the graphism.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal and our relationship with graphical creation.
It is also important to think about the graphical part of the employment.
The list does not only dress it, but created the production pages in magazines (on products given the trends for hand bags, mantle, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a graphist and graphist, has entered us from all this.
But this... until Sunday.
The list must have a general vision
Three guests of the speciality gave a diversified aspect at the Sabbath meeting full of information on different types of persons.
Honza Pokorny, list, Jakub Polanka mode graphist and Ben Renc, mode photograph.
Jacob reminded us that the mode is an illusion and the list should know to use it.
And a talentlist can work with one apartment differently.
Variability is for this primary example.
Like, for example, this trench-coat that must be carryed classically with a jean and a t-shirt like a mantle, but it can also dress the naked body, with scarpins and take it into photo as a dress.
Or it's enough to get up the bounds or the cow and have a new look immediately.
"Juge with this" he stressed.
But I especially appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then begin to oppose it," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we strive to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while sometimes in mode magazines we see something else.
No statement on mode rolls.
I know again, thanks to the mode photograph Ben that the list needs to have much more skills than those that are photographed.
I mean, for fashion story that will have a diction of pages (so a diction of models) I have to be ready to "detail" at least a fifteen.
And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than actually.
We must consider this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and the face of sometimes make half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which is not a super song, but its image and marketing made it a world star.
In Czechland, the approach to the use of the list services remains cold.
And faces with faces sometimes viewed them as unusual (it suffices me to know something but what I seemed to happen to the second range).
And if somebody makes a story from our side, then we have to count on the fact that he tells us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than that he has actually.
Then we are still able to navigate on google and make sure whether the bulevard information is a state of the relevant collectivity, if it has a magric or big...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it does not suffice the list to focus on the mode and to gather models.
It must be with the people he has, and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing to make people, don't flatter, keep their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his armour and fill it with new elements, you can't throw everything and say to him, "My God what terrible."
"You'll find a few businesses you'll find beautiful and he you'll advise how to bring them," said Mario.
This showed us specifically what must contain what we call the "placovka" or the sack of the list.
It's the one you're getting around the size and you've got on yourself for everything you need.
Besides the things defined as the ciss, the rolls for depilation or even the nutrition eggs, there are also nilo-fire (which the list uses for photographing products such as sacs, or many caps), special clips with which a closure is closed in the back, if it is too large (the eyele or other type of agraph is not useful because they could cover the clothes) or a cow kit.
In order to be not only people who listen, but who have tried something practically, they have taught us how to look like shoes correctly.
And during the photo seat in the athley where the surface is equal, the seed could be covered, strongly outside.
And that's how we did and did.
We did not have the right to touch the circles so that we would not hurt themselves inadvertently.
Therefore, we really need competence.
Mario loved me when he welcomed me for my creation.
The account I'm doing is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of course
I begin more to understand that to make a profession is not a promenade in a rose garden, that everyone tells what he wants.
The need for speed is disputed throughout America.
Revision
In the beginning, a course without problems is transformed because of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do in a morning road movement to work.
This fills everyone's ambition up to a certain measure but it doesn't serve anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitles of the theme produced great expectations before the output.
He promised to take a new direction with the Need for Speed course series already old and to get out of a kind of game from playing parties that would not only count with points.
So we were interesting in how the passports will be replaced during which the main hero is out of his car and does what he wanted.
As it has already been done in the NFS series, the result is fully different than what we did.
It is potentially a ride game but it goes down because of some unusual mistakes already existing for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but the expression of an incomprehensible faunacy from developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are taken in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them begins to participate in illegal courses through America.
You sit behind the flight on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive the first to New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The journey is divided in ten steps and then in more than 50 courses.
This results in each course on another roadway and the steps scheduled in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn't feel one instinct that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful even if the graphical technical level is the same type as the series.
Finally, this is not the end of the world.
But the transport through the wilderness, in automotive landscapes or well in highly snowed mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are more timely approved by a typical elemen.
For example, in the wilderness, you find you in a sand storm that decreases your visibility sensitively.
Then in the mountains, you must take care of what a avalanch doesn't fall on you.
In addition, the different courses are well organized behind each other.
There's only a small number but it's enough.
There are instincts you strive to overcome the number requested opponents (as in a classic course) and then run against the clock (classic dual with the chronometer) and then wait for another dual with an opposer.
From time to time, you have also the police that enters the game and trys to make you the difficult situation.
Newness is the passages out of the vehicle.
It is rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs before someone and you need to help it by pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing to be complicated.
What is surprising is that there are less times of this type than what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is that because this element cannot be gendered and placed, in the context above described, in the elements that approve the game.
The model of conduct is in the tradition of games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary at present, but it cannot be said that it is negative.
For the real simulation, you must go to another way.
But although we can find better in competition the model of conduct is very well with the type of design of courses.
So it's all right.
Problems begin to appear after a certain time.
In the difference of the model of conduct, the results are not yet at the point.
We do not have this game a complicated deformation and deformation, but when you don't have, when you have any object with, the smallest idea of how your car behaves, that's not completely good.
During locked overflows, you sometimes mutually touch you, but otherwise your car is part of foolish fools.
Or it's in myths.
Thanks to the renaming system, this is not really a problem, but it really hurts you.
The renumeration is so that when you've cut your figure or you've gone into the cut game, you're getting back at the last point on the road.
But you have only five renames.
When you used the 5 renames you must start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, if something doesn't happen as necessary, something you can actually count on.
Sometimes remarks don't help and the solution must be found by remembering the trailing track.
The big hair of this game is that the same actions are located in the same places.
For example, there are some virages that must be passed in a certain way otherwise, it doesn't happen.
Otherwise you meet on a given location of "civile" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, five, five seconds forward or a minute for delay.
What makes wrath is the situations when you see easily walking the opposite between two cars coming in inverse sense and when you arrive, you must either sit on the side and conturn them or free them.
It's equal if you go before him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the situation given it always comes close to your nose.
The opposers still have other benefits.
Pen held all the time of the game, you, you come to some places, again without worrying about time, and you still have the same opposite that leads you to the same place.
This envy the most in the end of the game when you roll on a long pont in the inverse sense.
The opposer must pass at all prices before you.
When it pass before you, it hides you the view of other vehicles in the inverse sense and you enter a lot of times.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something cuping and full of adredaline, but it is aware that you are quickly hurt.
And it's damage because through a simple conduct model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 single travelers, that the order of courses is like there's no chance of distressing or something else .
The original idea is the car change during the courses.
You must take care of the basic pumps on the roads because you can change the cars, however, most of the time you have provided.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sport cars are ideal for towns, the large American cylindres for the right routes and super sport cars on exotic surroundings on very technical drives, for example on lacet roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are courses in particular places you know about the adventure, is very good with the main system of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that are involved in your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to devote:
This connects online with the Autolog function that, among others, compares your results obtained with the other players and provides other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult steps to understand is the situation of the last course of the aventure.
You are coming with your car in the metro tunnel (za res≤) where you roll in the darkness on the roads (top).
Your speed indicator indicates between 150 and 200 km/h (forward) and behind you comes a metro branch that sends you the car directly to the railway.
In the editor, we had a discussion for a few days to know if someone really thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really take us for idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is in general pleasant and in some cases really super.
What triggers is that in extreme situations, imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially related to accidents with a lot of participants when a fluid imagery doesn't serve you anymore.
The sound part is good and the track is at the choice.
In order to please the largest number and especially the young public, a new sound track has been created in the "I mix everything", but we can expect nobody to buy the game for music.
General Presentation of Need for Speed: So it is really confused.
If the game hadn't had these stupid mistakes, we could without fear say that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it doesn't end.
The entertainment is really good, but you will prepare for the mistakes of your eyes with the force of a air reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassadora near the European Union:
Czechs behave as negativists and eurosceptives
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I wasn't taking me into such a hard war."
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players have a new role," so Milenena Vicenova started its exhibition to the Droit Faculty of the Czech ambassador near the European Union.
When she succeeded to describe the various EU bodies and their relationships in such a way understandable and →, while a lot of conferences from the Droit University of Charles could be able to send up, she showed how much she takes its "comprehensible and openly about Europe" too seriously.
Mrs. Vicenova has made the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent Chairman of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that he is hungry, that it is a round-out, that he can't fill any mission, and I must say he has cut the soul to everyone because he has his role in perfection."
"It's a man who can listen to 27 Member States, well-pleasing with them and has a vision of the direction to take Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question, "Who is in the European Union?" "Who is the phone number I have to call?", so as an important step towards uniqueness and a greater readability of the Union's policy towards states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit our syrecky (cookie cooking footage that feels very strong)
Mrs. Vicenova also stated that the European Council will live and live in a close time.
It qualified the Czech Presidency for two years ago.
Czechs have resolved the amount of financial crisis, gas crisis or have organized a summit for a Eastern Partenariat.
It qualified the loss of very negative governance and harmed the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation of the EU is currently very busy.
According to Madam's words, "the activity has completed it" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved yet.
Moreover, the new seventh budget of the Union must be approved, which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would be that the budget would be weak and for economy, which priority will have, the countries will at least be helped at least in the framework of future negotiations.
Ms. Ambassadrice reminded her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a comprehensive Europe".
"I really don't love the abbreviations, the foreign words, the jardines that no one understands.
As the citizen needs to understand that it is true that no one makes round or tordus corners in Brussels, bananas differently large or whether no one prohibits us to make syrecky."
It wants to better use the EU environment and see more Czech in the European institutions.
A Europe at several speeds expects us
According to Ambassadrica, the Czechs have the reputation of being eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspects more than positive.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small representation in the European institutions.
The error results from several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their incapacity to write a letter of motivation and low support of the Czech Party.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, it stressed the force and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Create me, when the Polandian, the Magyar, the Slovak, comes to me, this French said, "Hey, what are you doing there, what does this group of Visegrad still do?"
According to Madam Vicenova, in a near future, these are new hard rules on budgetary policy which are expected by Member States.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if it is not at several speeds, which provides instead of a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and other outside the area."
"We have the Schengen space, we also have the Enhanced Cooperation Institute."
First of all, it was said that the countries who wanted him and those who did not want him were in their corner."
"There will be many institutions of this type and there will be a real Europe at two speeds," Mrs. Vicenova said.
In this regard, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basiss which all the subjects with an impact on the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not only the members of the eurozone.
History of a mark:
The IBM innovationer starts in the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that expressed the IBM strategy nearest, the nearest would be "the long term".
For a wide public IBM is the symbol of revolution, it is a firm feeling as very present and however since its creation he has spent hundreds of years.
The base of this long-term strategy was cast by the first head of the firm, Vice-President Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that a lot of global problems could be solved for a little while that people would want to think.
His "PENSE" slogan has become the print about which the life of a generous future will be developed (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis for the culture of the company developed carefully by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements guided to the future.
IBM survived hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values, but she was not afraid to change all the other around her.
This has allowed us to transform the business, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will reach more for the birthday, Samuel J. Palmisano's current director.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the thirty years, began to take care of his employees as Bata in Czech Republic - the IBM people were the only one of the first American employees who had paid vacations, a assurance payed by the employer more a legate employment uniform and a well-developed system of resources for inventors and commercials.
Similarly, IBM has a system of relationships with the well-developed client.
The company was at the beginning of a genius in the covering of talents - as one of the first firms who had abolited any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is fully in mind of the antidiscrimination strategy because it will be a Virginia Rometty woman - which should replace Palmisano with the IBM head.
This works at the IBM for 30 years and currently occupies the head of Ventes, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has done what is called Jamy, the brain storming online from which many future strategies and innovations have been issued.
It is not surprising that he has many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500 000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
This is the internal and external image of the company that provides him a safe position in business areas.
"From the beginning of the IBM had a concept rather than institutional than a firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economy at Harvard Economy School and author of the IBM book.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm helping to solve business problems using its own," was Geogre Colony of the Company of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Green Blue", as it is called the United States in respect of its slogan - she has grown up to become one of the largest world firms.
It is obviously the most polyvalent firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, housing, Council services at the level of products from the server to the nano.
It has many patents of all American firms and five of its employees received a Nobel price.
Of its discoveries, for example, the distributor of billets, payment card, financial swap, bar code or the diskette.
IBM was found this year with $220 billion the second largest company of the market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first passed over in 1996 Microsoft.
Advanced reviews
These are not all innovations and manufactures that have had the customer and time preference - for example, IBM did not succeed on a own OS/2 operational system, the Prodig service online or well of IBM PCjr computer:
"From the time your business is based on the advance movement you can't be emotionally stuck on the past, "remarks Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes out.
In the difference, for example, of the Microsoft competitor who is on the basis and remains under the Windows operational system.
A Perspective
In the IBM income, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a preliminary place.
However, in 1990 she was more than the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM sold low rental assets for $15 billion, in this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of perspectives.
It continues in investment and even since 2008 when it for the first time exceeded the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiated with its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who also increased its investment volume during the large economic crisis.
Did IBM now seem to pass the current crisis without being concerned?
The price of the IBM action has progressed from 2008 in a range of 120 per cent, and the net benefit of the company continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
It can be expected that this flexible magician of other crises may be the same.
History of IBM: From tranches of swimming to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it first had the complex name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a company's support in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the combination of four firms whose history is linked in the 1980s of the ninth century.
They had Âs such as the former "pointer", the pendules that registered the harvest and the department of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was president of the Society Surveillance Council until 1930.
Flint embauched the leader of a competitive company Thomas J. Watson to help her lead the company.
The leader then made the shadow to the founder of the firm -- it is on Watson's ideas that still represent the identity and culture of the society.
Watson was heading the company to the coast in 1952.
IBM, as he says his name, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - tranches of swimming and meat to recording boxes.
During the first four years where Watson was running, the business number multiplied up to 9 million dollars and started the extension of the company throughout all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of direction, he was his son who occupied the headquarters, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM started developing artificial intellectuality and developed the first programming language.
In the 60s, people and IBM computers helped NASA drive flights in the cosmos - on Mercure, Saturne, and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the time computer standard with the name of IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its manufacture of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of advice and services with a high value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM in the last three years - is the concept of Smarter Planet "a smarter planet".
Its goal is the intellectual promotion of the population in areas that are not yet exploited, such as transport and management of cities.
For the area of IBM trade, there has been a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps commercials to manage the whole trade cycle.
IBM has a strong story also on our territory.
She created her contribution in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center of Brno.
The Central Central and Eastern Europe is sitting in Prague and there is also the worldwide research and development team that cares for the speech.
Richtarova about her trusted husband:
Ivette, you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it's over!
After his husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) became guardian of the body and loved by Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina would still hope that Joseph would wake up from his rose dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in Bartosova in her home, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted to dismiss from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa didn't relax the song.
And he acknowledged in public that he loved him.
With the time Darina resigned herself, accepted her husband's connection and ended by saying goodbye forever.
Richtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to take her at the door of the house.
"It's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one's gonna put it out."
"He will no longer be my old loved and lost age, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," he left Rychtarova filtering by showing that she was dismissed from her husband, but they are only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and don't change."
"My wife put a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of reparations, garden, real estate, I buy."
"As Darina, we are talking completely normally but we don't sleep in" said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep in it, and he doesn't care for me to know where she goes, with who and if she has a connection.
I know that it's my fault, I've been loved with Iveta and I'm taking all the responsibility on me," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: is that what you do too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, like others, are able to get them out of their manch.
My dear ladies, you're going to know in the following lines of women's vices that come to pump the blood of men's vineyards.
Purchases
Your half makes you note that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least a clothes a week?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of soldes?
In your case, you can talk about purchases as a ↓.
Some women think that they should limit their passion to purchase.
But you say, what would resist the lac-vitrine of clothing stores, seek for yourself beautiful clothes and then try them all in cabin (the idea of different colors)?
And even though for most women buying is a hobby, this can become a real hell for men.
Remember how many times you told your mate he's waiting at the income...
Constant Insatisfaction
"I'm not too big?"
"I'd have to make at least 5 kilos - I should start doing sport?"
"You're sorry?"
Didn't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yeah?
So you are part of these women who are obsessed by their appearance.
This is not the question you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are allergic because their partners are always complaining about his appearance.
The strong sex does not stress to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become emotional.
Wood and cleanness at the first place
It's like a finish manage.
Sleep windows, pass the aspirant, clean the ground, make the dust, break the bath room - and this twice a week.
Do you note your partner that he walks with salt feet on the own ground, to the children they went out the lavabo, broke the vitre of the living room, and that gives you a lot of work?
If you are actually suffering from this situation, try to think that nothing should be exagered and that the order and cleanness should not be at the first place in the family.
However, this unrepentant desire of cleanness can distort your relationships and even family peace.
Shadow Work
"But this surrounding used in the puzzle."
"You're going to put these old shoes tomorrow?"
"A mooled sergeant has nothing to do on earth."
If you do this work on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really decompose it.
It is obvious that you don't think badly you want everything to be inevitable.
Maybe if men do it, women wouldn't have to do so bad work...
Diffusion, persipulation
Diffusion, persuasion, but also insults against someone are also the own of certain women.
Women are particularly related to relations and thus are pleased to treat subjects such as, where, with who, how and why.
Maybe everyone of us let us escape a little inoffensif persipulation here and there.
However, the hand on the heart is a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persuade, even disappoint others, and are for their surroundings - especially in a female collective - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by participating in Philadelière's victory
The hokeyist Jagr attacker participated twice in Philadelière's victory during the Monday NHL match on Caroline's ice and is again headed by productive Czech players for concurrence.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Giroux, who has yet made a more step and was appointed the best player of the match, he marked in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also stored two goals during the match.
Traveling after the match told out-atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great night.
"I told him before the match he would give his ha-trick."
"I felt it."
"Whenever this feeling falls on you," Jar explained after his action Giroux marks a goal of the first stream of Flyers.
An instant later was a second trial of the Czech team.
Voracek fighted behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the palette and presented it to the Maxime Talbot boxer.
A second before the first pause, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a decent, but the start of the second part belongs to Flyers.
Specificly in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he marks three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player of the ligue but he's really part of the three best," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of a career with a hokeychit like him."
"I'm really pleased with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years in NHL the other players of the team have tried to play on me, now it's my tour," I've said Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this truck because with a purpose of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a penalty course she ends with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not remove other complications that ended two against one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He picked on the palette, I took the speed and (Read) went to the most remote corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I arrived there," describes the last purpose of matching Voracek's viewpoint.
Philadelité has arrived with this victory head of the East Conference.
The Czech Defensor of Montréal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo in second third part because of a wound in the top of the body.
The Candians did not face a experimental defendant who lost their progress of two targets after a penalty threshold of 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
This is the fact that the back line was sick that mostly embedded the local entrier instead of lost points because they played the match with only 5 defenders.
"It's no."
"We played the match only with a experimental player, the rest was young."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," Jacques Martin said.
"The replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We were just planning to simplify the game, move the palette out of our area."
For this, we had limites, "the one of P. K. Subban defenders.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defendant, participated in the thirteenth Winnipeg attack and the victory at Tampou Bay.
Uax targets of the Jets have participated in 5 different shots, which have stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have developed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travels, especially in the countries of the socialist block, because the roads to the West were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (the two in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period of 1962 to 1972 when it was authorised to travel to Yugoslavia, then the regime began to have a inclination to the West and the travel to Yugoslavia were very limited to the Czech tourists.
The large paradox of the socialist time was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist block (as for the Czech Slovaks) to travel individually even in the context of socialist countries.
Where the Czechoslovakian wanted to travel individually in Poland or in the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual travel was not allowed.
The travel agencies at that time also offered travels to the West, however, it was necessary to make the cup all night with a bed bag or having a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it wasn't winning yet.
The agreement for the devises that was the condition of traveling to the west was made to people "politically wrong" that couldn't be able to travel.
However, the Czechoslovakian currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to make financial means without the West Country to travel to the West.
The Czechs most often passed their holidays in the country where there were many campaigns and chalets houses that the Czechs bought and this hard habit until now.
Czech travels have since 1989 a large revolution.
Although the holidays in Eastern Germany and Bulgaria were maximum until 1989, the Czechs spent the last year to the foreign 4 million days of vacation in the countries of the world.
The big paradox we have no knowledge today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go free to 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The elimination of visa in the past 90s of the western neighborhood countries caused a huge short-term visit, especially in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't travel for a long time in the west that everyone wanted to see at least one instinct.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical travel travel of a Czech travel was at that time to carry his own preserved food, saucisson, etc. to economy.
Another important instance was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown that finally allowed our tourists to buy freely from the West currency.
Our livelihood and the average salary increased what caused about 1997 another important time.
With a growing request for travel, travel agencies have started from 1997 to prepare tours with aircraft bindings which, through contracts, have reduced the costs in relation to what was before.
At the end of the past 90th century, the Czechs had unvisual links with practically most of the developed countries in the world other than the EU who later facilitated our travels.
Another moment interesting in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to a exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, direct air charters have issued Czech tourists in the remote hot countries; this winter will have 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
These are more than 100000 Czechs who visit exotic countries each year!
An interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development has occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU removed the visa for the Czech tourists and allowed our country to be completely in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs for the first time in the history passed over half of their holidays in the foreign (50,3%) and for the first time in the history spent more than 15,000 hours per person for vacations in the foreign, including the added charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this can end with a situation without a solution to "a pat"
Nearly five months the Czech football is without President and it may be that the follower of Ivan Hasek at the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly which must be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement which vote regulation should be made.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas ́lik are interested in the direction of the Czech football.
Hasek gave his demission in June, and during his department, he called his people to join and find a strong personality that will lead the football in the future.
Only during the year after Hasek, the football returned to differences between the Association rooms that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely shown on 16 September when a new president had to choose.
The delegates of the General Assembly have unnecessaryly meet in the National House in Prague because the negotiation has remained blocked and it has not even been questioned to deal with the way to eliminate.
It was not agreed to know who has the right to vote to the General Assembly - only, is it the statutary representatives or also the fully-powered officers.
In this unique point, there was a partial agreement since this time with the assistance of the Bureau for State and Right, which is not possible to represent on the basis of full power.
Divergences continue on the election regulation.
It is too much that the Ex-Committee, which has been planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also brought nothing to the situation.
The opinions on the possibility of vote have changed several times, but the neurological point remains the same.
The question is: how to go for the third tour to not fall in the bed.
"The discouragement pome is in the following case: whether to proceed the statutes or to find another model," observed one of the three Presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, which represents the professional football inside the Republic of Dusan Svoboda.
According to the rules of the scheduled model, the third trial of the candidates will receive the most procent vote in the room for which it is candidate.
Moravia is ready for what is said to go back to win the candidate who will receive the largest percentage of votes from the two rooms.
And the Czech part studies the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two tours and it would completely make the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, which comprises the objections of the morable and best would not change the regulation and vote on the present statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas ́lik is also agreed even if he considers that the regulation of the elections established is the most beneficial status of Pelta among all candidates.
"I would like to vote at the maximum of the statutes of the House."
"In order to have no sacred ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assemblys," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is candidate for the first time and who in its exhibitions was particularly defined against Pelta.
The Pelta remains optimist.
According to him in Nymburk, there will be a new Chairman and believes that candidates will cooperate in the future in and in construction.
"The potential qualification in Europe's Championnat today should calm everyone."
"Fotball will be again on a battle of happiness and there will be more entry for a cooperation," says Jablonec's officer, who has the greatest experience in the direction of the football as well as at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimist.
"I believe this agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is very tender."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are tends to want to change the design regulations."
"This may cause a blocking again to the General Assembly."
"I hope the same reason I'm going to win," Rajchl said.
There is no longer time for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should have been held directly in Montenegro, but who can say whether the whole direction of the football is complete for the match.
The flight specially disappointed in which of traveling to Podgorice, among other things, Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not find out for technical reasons and was searched for a variety to take a part of the ex-committee on the area of repressions.
Finally, this is the Ministerial Meeting, which may have been held on Thursday, which should be determining.
The Minister for Youth Education and Sports of Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties from the country's highest sport and to bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a statistical dotation, football credibility, and also the Czech Sports General Assembly, which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
It goes to fight for the Chairman's position because he does not see any correct candidate.
If the leader of the Footballers of Plzen Tomas'lik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have answered to all that he requested for a new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) would not be campaigned for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I don't present me to the election."
"But in the present situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
The motivation of ́lik is to enter into competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from reaching the AFRT head, which would first be given favor for this election.
It also emphasizes that if he had taken the elections, he would hold the Chairman's post only until 2013 for a General Assembly.
It would well see in the function a experienced and high-level manager but not connected with the football world.
"I discussed with people who had the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some said to me that they didn't want to be identified with the Czech football at this time."
"I'd like to change this picture," he said.
It is said, especially, that is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of the Plzen Roman Berbr Football man, who is known as a lobbyist who is able to influence the vote of the delegates of the General Assembly.
It is not acceptable for Pelta to take this Chairman's position.
"If he won, the current state would stay and there would be nothing in the football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high flight trading, it would be even less favorable to the football," declared it.
What the shock is still the fact that the name of Pelta has been spoken a few years ago during listening in the context of a question on a corruption case, for which Pelta has been outside without worry.
"I don't know what Pelta pretty would bring to football."
"And how we should be considered in the eyes of the EUFA and the FIFA'd'lik, who said, "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club."
In the case where it triumphed at the vote of Thursday, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by ́lik before the General Assembly of September, who had finished by a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"It (Pelta) would be the first I'd go with."
"It's great capacities"
"He would be able, for example, to present himself as head of the representation."
"But as the Association manager it wouldn't be able."
"I don't put the nose in what I don't know," Indian ́lik, who took great attention in September when he spoke for the cancellation of the Commission of Arbitrs with Ludek Macela replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
It claims that it would be at the level of management of the Association.
He takes as example his ability to lead private firms and that he also has led the Plzen club since last year, who has celebrated with its support in May in the first division.
"I have the strength to make something change in the sport world and bring a certain culture there."
"I would free the influence of some interested groups who, for example, have the tendency to influence the disciplinary and calling Commission, which leads to bad go's situations," he said, "enough doesn't hide his antipathia for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympical Committee, which the lobby power in high-level policies would allow for more sports of the tax on games.
"This is one of the key points the new President should take place."
"If this is the tax on hazard games as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
It does not take its current connection with the Plzen club as a negative thing even if it himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is connected again with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"This isn't the idea."
I don't see why to send my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to return a year and a half after," said ́lik.
Pelta has promised new statues for the AFRT that should end the situations of bed.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to the chairman Miroslav Pelta promised that if it was chosen, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future on the election Regulation.
Jablonec's officer is very optimistic before Friday meeting in Nymburk and thinks that today's success of the football representation should calm this vote before the vote.
The Pelta before the election of September, which had not been done, promised just to dedicate himself to the national representation and to obtain financial means if it was chosen.
It decided to be candidate at the last moment just before the past General Assembly, and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his view of football direction and present it in a wide context.
"The people at all levels have made football for a long time, waiting for Thursday there's a President."
"They feel that it's the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association," he says, "but he's first connected with the Jablonec club, worked a lot of years in Sparta and the Ex-Committee of the Union.
is also why he has enough experiences to lead the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election, there is an euphory that ruled at Ivan Hasek's time.
"Happy to the General Assembly of the Statutes of June, they were approved that were not perfect as they were all considered."
"If there were no all these different interpretations, we would have already had a President since September," Mr Pelta.
This is just the most important revision of the document of civilians who took all the attention of the delegates.
"If I become the President, I take it as a personal mission and I'm ready to take all responsibilities in case it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta said.
Then he strives to not confront his opposers.
He said earlier that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his right training and that he knew that his opposite-candidat would be his first Vice-President.
He has not yet been attacked for a long time, Tonas ́lik, who does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He has developed in the football for a year and has already been successful."
"Their attacks were, however, not most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opposer's address, but remain faithful to the announcements he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to national representation.
It should be a football witch.
"And I would also strive to finish all the cases that begin with the Bohemians or the result of the corruption scandale."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could have enough money for all the football," the Czech Press Agency said the 46th candidate to the Czech Press Agency two months ago.
He also said that his nomination to the football head would not have brought any change in people.
"I should come to know all employees," he said to Strahov where there is a comprehensive nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are disaster scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he thinks that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is a single point of debate on how to vote at the third tour, we will overcome it."
"Fotball needs credibility and it will only be obtained when there is a new leader at his head," as Pelta says in optimistic way two days before the day probably determining for his officer's career.
Rajchl promises that under its direction the AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected a new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday, it would not like a lot of people.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he would choose, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and make the members of the Ex-Committee responsible for the various fields of football.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case, to improve relations with EUFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and to continue the work started by President Ivan Hasek.
"As the President, I want to take care of football throughout her."
"International contacts with the EUFA and the FIFA through national representation, professional football and a feetball for youth."
"But I don't say I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in a CTK maintenance.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute skills within the Exhibitive Committee so that each member may take care of a specific area."
"And I'll distribute hard missions to make football a big step forward."
"Multium people will not be happy because it will begin to work hard instead of criticizing others," he said.
He stated that he would not be a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if this is worth the coup and if I'm gonna have people behind me who will put me in the wheels and put doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he was crazy.
"Multium people said to me that I don't have to deny because they would also reject."
"It's a trust I can't trace," he said.
What motivates it is also to continue working started with Hasek.
"Several two years ago, there's been a great real work and I don't want to let it fall."
"There have been processes that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them." He said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election, the situation in the Union does not return as Hasek was before.
"I believe in a systematic work and this is something Mirek Pelta doesn't know."
"There are people who would do football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen."
"We can regret a lot of things but certainly not support anybody."
"I'm trying to be a target."
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will please it not only those who have been chosen
And it confirms again that it would be only a Chairman for the Czech Republic.
"And if there's anyone who's saying the contrary, I'm ready to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts the one Czech and the other movies whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation now with only three living teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas ́lik, President of the Plzen Club, has entered into the competition for the Chairman's post, Rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances of winning.
"I feel continually supported by the Czech Chamber who has chosen my Vice-President and knows that there will be success with me," Rajchl who considers among his future success to economy tens of millions of coroners on unnecessary contracts, negotiations with television and games.
In contrast, he said that the fact that the Association is not united is a common mistake for all.
While he says about Pelta "what it is disqualified because the Czech footblal with him would lose his credibility," he thinks the second opposite is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"Nobody can doubt Plzen that he has done a great job this year."
"If he was chosen, he would certainly continue in what Hasek started and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commission."
"It wouldn't want to fail his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his own.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A spring in the blue
De Julia Stanek
Pat's oven's optical ovens, wonderful pools of Budapest: Who travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or making a long promenade - can allow his feet to rest in gaseous water bags.
A book shows in which bassin of natation can be the most well-being experience.
When Iris Meder was on the search travel during the last 18 months, there is an object that should not miss in his baggage: his bathroom maillot.
Extended on his back in the water, she observed the artificially arranged cocktails, and nailed against the Putten marbles that touched it on the other side of the pool and missed to add the Art New metically restored from these converted pools.
If a covered pool made her pleasure, she would note in her book without time all the valuable details of the type of building and the story of building.
More than 200 pools were investigated in this way by the architecture history of Meder and she presented them in her book already presented: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The municipal pools covered by Münich, historical bain palaces in the black forest, "Beton Hardcore buildings" in the Taunus.
She conducted her "reise to the most exceptional bathrooms in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Near Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited sites in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
Germany of 46 years is a real fervent of the bain culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sport but he feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is irritant that the supporters of the natation must be pleased to watch blue carriers and accommodate the Javel's water potential while players breathe from the perfume sending epicea forests or can listen to the gas of joyful birds of the park.
"I asked myself one day why the pools must always be so quiet," said the venois.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water double strengthens the architecture
A flood in a pool and oil of sauna - a well-being factor in the natation rooms are big because all senses are wake up, according to Meder.
And if the baptizers had been given a little more painful, the narrow rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a plane, we have a surface of water in the natation rooms."
"He's on a transparent side, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically present in a double way: high voices, multicolor carriers, tremplins.
The image volume of small "Badefreuden" format makes a decent report of 190 pages of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical welfare - he certainly wants to make a shot in the blue.
Collective Meder has covered noteworthy examples during her research in Hungary.
Besides the well-being bains like the 100-year-old Shechenyi bain in Budapest, she found waters containing nitrate in a natural cavern in the karst (cavern bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a bath of therms whose bassins are filled with water containing alcali and (Városi Termal birdö in Jaszbereny) and found in a bottle building.
On the contrary, the pools heated in full air of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a toilet of Zürich's bathroom we have all the city in his eyes, we can add the Arlberg snowed from St. Anton's outside pool: The Turkish bain is combined with a window from which the animation can be observed on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary basen design expects the nagers in Längenfeld: The Water Dome Ötztal is nothing to a OVNI that has just arrived on the Alpes.
In the winter, the vapor is from the three open plates, while in the background the mountains of Öztal to heaven.
Alhambra in black forest
Javel's water wool doesn't take all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermical bains produce a suffrage, from the Ard-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba, a strong oil sugar, which is difficult to believe, to be in a health spa.
The odor comes from therapeutic alcaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its limon brings you to the skin as soon as you let you drag into the pool - a special spa experience.
See her search for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also was deceived: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free and full air from Checoslovakia, she was found in front of a barricade land.
The bathroom designed by Dušan Jurkovic Architecte in 1902 was inter-time closed.
When she looked ahead through the window of the immeuble-Art New in red-bla-Young, she observed the extent of bad herbs between the carriers.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's therm palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it is not only possible to discover neo-romain elements that are out of its conception in 1844 but also a wretched room in Alhambra, which was given to him in 1900.
Since 1995's careful modernisation, the thermal palace remains the favourite bain of the basin expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is originating from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a beautiful performance that is to make buildings so different in a so amazing unit," Meder said.
With such a palace, the floor in the thermal pool is apparently only a small question.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank examines in detail the speculation on primary materials
De Christian Teevs
Does the German bank leave its speculation on the main materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Joseph Ackermann loaded a working group to search for the consequences of speculation for poor people in the world.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to have the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the matter is: According to a study, 84% of the Germans find it inacceptable that the banks speculate on materials such as maïs and vegetables.
Two thirds of the interviewed people even require that the German bank and other credit institutions disturb this affair because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid October.
The author Harald Schumann stresses in this article that the speculation of the Bourses on the global primary materials, moves the prices up and the banks share complications in world hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is strictly aligned against the leader of the Deutsche-Bank, Joseph Ackermann, even if the large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
The speculation on primary materials was initially introduced to protect goods from price fluctuation.
But most experts share in time the opinion that pariters have dismissed their offers and asked - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism of the American competitors: he promised to investigate the prosecutions and said, "No matter is worth playing the right reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, a international working group currently examines Foodwatch-Report.
The examination must be completed at the end of the year and then the results of the German Bank's Management Board must be submitted - with a recommendation, of habit.
End of January, the Chairman of the Bank will indicate the consequences to take place.
It could result in a reduction in the market of primary materials, or even a complete abandon.
Ackermann built for Image
The leader of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the new, but at the same time confirmed its criticisms towards the financial sector: "The speculation on the increase in food prices shows in a particular draconical way, as today's banks harm the general interest."
Ackermann is the first lobby to be particularly responsible today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all positions from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculations", said Bode.
"It is little important for Mr. Ackermann, whether there is a question of hungry people or whether the German Bank's reputation is in play."
Ackermann's consciousness may appear first surprisingly, but it is that the PDG of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before it leaves its functions.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Administrative Council will not change anything to what is intended in the Administrative Council.
He could improve his mark image with a delay of conflicted agricultural speculations.
And for possible losses, he does not care about it - his follower will be concerned about it.
One of the two would resume the positions on the main materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
More than 30,000 internationals have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode held Mardi's survey, with which the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November made questionnaires to 1001 people.
Only 11 percent found that the Deutsche Bank offers places for which food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one of the two would, after the investigation, respond to all the places for which money is injected in the specifications on primary materials.
43 percent would be able to make such a bank around them, 49 per cent replied that they would reflect on the resiliation of their account to change the institution.
21th house in Vienna
The Pavillon that has dismissed
The Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with high, lower, and Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 received prices, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell in ruin.
Now it is open again and holds place of exhibition house.
If we are enthusiasmed for a modern post-war-building, for its forms, his glass-hangars, its live and audacious longs and its new building materials that are typical of faith in the technical progress, then the Austrian architect Karl Swanzer is a good and famous example for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958.
The Pavillon de Schwanzer received the "Green Prix of Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Construction is considered to be a major step in the modern architecture.
He made the so famous, that he also built the Pavillon for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With his ́endary house at four BMW cylindres and its adjacent building in Munich, he finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary building was exposed after the universal exhibition in the Switzerland Garden at the South Garden of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither technically adapted to a museum - no walls to cross the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was so long used until the contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and was more delighted.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavillon, now he has the name "Maison of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as Museum for the modern art.
Wednesday evening the Belveder Museum opened, whose house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at all points of view.
Agnès Husslein-Arco, which became the new guideline of the Belvedere Austrian Gallery in 2007, was conducted well.
Husslein-Arco, promoted a large historic of art to a career between her youth of artistic patterns, then at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and as a founding guide of the modern art Museum of Salzbourg, she was particularly well-handed with the transformation travels of political men and the protection of monuments, it received public funds and private sponsoring and established the exploitation.
Except the contemporary art, the works of the Sculptator Fritz Wotruba whose foundation has the same name were exposed there, a coffee and a library are located there, and a office must be built there.
Strength monitoring, small budget
For Krischanitz's implementation, then, was the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and extended the sequence of Joseph Olbracht and had won the concurrence, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that the pavilion for him was "an extremely important place" where he had seen the exhibitions "approximately every week-end".
He knew the project of origin, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost generosity and generosity after his movement to Vienna and by its change in use.
During the current transformation, there were big problems: the building was "a energy gap", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of glass made windows were changed, the isolated glass strengthened in glass fibres was placed and the toilet was replaced by a special safety glass.
The pots of the thermal ponts have been strengthened or replaced, and the clothes filled with amiant were rehabilitable.
Two sub-sols have made the place to the new exploitation, a tamazed light panel between the house and the road provides the lighting, a pont leading to the entrance - it is almost a new building, but always holding Pavillon Schwanzer.
External doors of origin have remained, the house is painted in a tent of protection against red-brun red wheel.
And the movie room is even exactly the same as it was ever.
And all of this is closely monitored by the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"There are materials that are good and less dear to be found, and they also enjoy the Office of Protection of monuments," Krischanitz said and he draws attention to a brutal ground in subsol.
Despite all restrictions, problems and transformation, the building remained flat and slow.
It would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "which came from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such a technology is "always in the wrong place" and wants to "wake up the good conscience."
But in this case, the 21th century's House is not in the wrong place, because if it is a town building opportunity: around the Garden of Switzerland is just the "quarter of the central garage" of everything newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may occur: The 21th century's House could benefit from the strengthening of another building of Krischanitz, because Francesca von Habsburg's collection has bought the Berlinish Temporary Art Centre, and, as it says, she has already negotiated with the city in order to have a site in the neighborhood of the Switzerland Garden.
Bahn plans a fixed winter crisis in millions.
The railway company developed a crisis plan, aiming to avoid winter train accidents.
The number of salaries should be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to winter season and delays, the "Deutsche Bahn" railway company will cost more than 70 million additional in this year.
The "Bild"-Zeitung daily reported to the preliminary by calling on a internal crisis plan to the group that investments of approximately 300 million euro would be planned until 2015.
This should also enable the improvement of vehicles and railway networks in extreme time.
The number of internal and external salaries for the decline of railway facilities and of which, inter alia, should duplicate and pass to 16,000 people.
The goal is to release the snow and ice from the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the road devices necessary for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube held the Government and industry at a conference to the top of train accidents also occurred in the winter.
The last winter, the railway society has had a huge problem with the transport of users, because it is missing reservations in case of difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been allowed for years by the Iron Ministry.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has since years of what to do, since it has to make the ICE trains just more frequently check, after an ICE breakdown has occurred in the central garage of Cologne.
The German "Deutsche Bank" bank pays millions of penalties in the United States.
In the case of Chief Joseph Ackermann, there is a new place in the United States: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay an amend to millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this sector's gentlemen increased the rattrap to the United States: the Francfort Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to resolve a difference due to the failure of five large co-operative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypothec documents.
The NCUA financial market regulator has a series of accusations to the large banks and has encouraged the cooperative banks to make false promises on the purchase of financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
These documents lost great value during the financial crisis and led banks down.
"We are satisfied that we could have found a solution on this matter, without the parties to start a procedure in the court," said a German Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank did not recognize any mistake in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has committed a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of the NCUA Debbie Matz accepted the consents of the two institutions.
The National Credit Union (CUA) is responsible for the United States Cooperative Banks and intervenes in case of failure to protect customer deposits.
The CUA tries to repair the damage of several billion dollars.
The presently concluded comparisons are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks in part and was assigned before the Court of Justice JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The question of the hypothec documents is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are based on it.
When the American immobile bullet was exposed in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of companies.
In September 2008, at the summary of the financial crisis, the United States Investment Bank Lehman Brothers took place.
Although the events have been given for a few years, it is currently a storm wind on the American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have intended a lot of recruitment to repair or to sanctify deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has deployed the largest state of complaints.
It reckons to 18 large international banks, to both American immobiliers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that they have been advanced in nature in cases of hypothecs of about 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank must also submit a complaint to the FHFA, which is a number of operations of a total amount of $14.2 billion for 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but, however, without indicating a specific sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the requests as injustified and said that he wanted to defend himself.
WARREN Buffett increases 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the financing manager, invests colossal amounts in the IBM TI.
Since March, he has purchased action for a value of over 10 billion dollars.
Until then, the US big investor Warren Buffett explains not to invest in TI computer companies, since the long-term development of companies is only a bad project.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed its opinion on investment in this sector.
It had already been to understand much earlier than the IBM offers services and computer systems for TI sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered as an attack on horse in the world of the financial.
The TI IBM activity is therefore granted the right to be called "Mister IBM".
Because Buffett has now revealed the CNBC economic emission, which he has bought IBM actions from March of $10,7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large IBM shareholder with a part of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that IBM never knew anything about this commitment until now.
He welcomed the direction, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You've done a great job," Buffett strategicly said.
IBM has been put on profitable TI services for a while as the exploitation of accounting centres.
The informal pioneer, older than 100 years old, also offers software and consultation as well as very perfect business computers.
Buffett had so far avoided businesses.
He states that he only invests in businesses whose businesses he understands.
But in contrast, Buffett attacks rather than rail fresh, rubber manufacturers or machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has approximately 80 branches, as well as parts of a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
This Octare of 81 years had been renewed in the 1960s" the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and had produced it in the range of one of the most prestigious world businesses, using intelligent investments.
However, his life is modesty.
That's why it is a figure of worship for many investors in the world.
His sense almost unfailable to win money valued him the surname of "Omaha Oracle".
After Buffett's investment announcement, IBM's actions increased with a percentage at the bourgeois.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a burial value of more than $220 billion and account with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious worldwide enterprises.
In Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate in it.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is insufficient
After the "Zwickauer cell" covering, the Turkish media doubt about the German rights status.
A newspaper even speaks of a "sleeping ideology" that would be renewed now.
The eight Turkish citizens and a small Greek company had an extreme context in the years 2000-2006.
Following this news, Turkey and the German and Turkish population react with fear and anxiety.
Because for many Turkish brothers, the spectrum that we believed was dead a long time has renewed its appearance: since M'n's burning attitudes in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no more violence comparable to this extreme context of right against the Turks.
That there is a xenophobie in Germany, however, it has never been questioned.
However, the extreme right network that has been detected reveals the proportions of which the size is far away from being predicted.
"Is it a return to blood ideology," "This was the title of the transmission on the Internet of the Turkish "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah emphasises that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and concerns the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right bourbury.
This is reasonably the reaction of the Turkish community in Germany: it called this weekend to a quiet memory of racial violence victims at the door of Brandebourg.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had considered a ceremonie of the fifth anniversary of the German-Turkey recruitment agreement.
It is with gay colors that cohabitation has been scanned, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a giffle: "The gift of Germany for the fifth anniversary" is the title of a article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murderers.
In addition, the German parution of "Hürriyet" does not privacy to deal with unity conditions.
"this starts with a boy," it is the title of the Chronic of Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people would have been acquired, paid taxes and would have contributed important to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The police action was considered very critically on the German-Turks forests, and these had then discussed the success of their research.
Why has it not come to the mind of the German authorities much earlier to make research in some midnight suspicious right-hand surprises, the authors are surprised.
More than one seems ready to at least a retoric or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be broken, the migrants will remain nothing but self-defence and army."
"it will be the best self-defence."
"Internal peace in Germany is strongly dependent on the quality of information and the importance of the penalty of the network," wrote "Selen".
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, Mõn and Solingen's attitudes have been well explained in the 1990s.
The photo of ruins after the burning of Solingen is deeply incredible in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has been shown more to the Turks living here than to a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which defiance and distantness by violence acts are to deploy.
However, the attents have affected our feelings in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past errors
It is especially the failure of German policies after the attacks of the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl has visited the surroundings of Mõn.
After the incendie of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish State, represented the funerals in Cologne by his Foreign Affairs Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population was produced.
As if a man's value could be evaluated on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once more how deep the defiance of many Germany-Turks has been given to local rights since that date.
In addition to the efforts to enhance the clarification and reevaluation of extreme rights terrorism in Germany, it is necessary this time.
The Zürich Lake Scandal Bank
The most aventureous European Bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and suffers in time from a crisis to another.
It's a German who has to lead now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular department of the Bundesbank's head; in July, it was known that it would take a nearly as spectacular post in 2013: President of the Council of Administration of the Great Swiss Bank UBS - a large step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was delighted, welcomed; Switzerland for her beauty and UBS for her recently obtained solidity and made famous observations on the future.
"UBS succeeded Turnaround."
"I'm pleased with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
Yet, since September, he was able to change everything.
A UBS Title market in London had distorted all the security systems of the Bank and had flammed about 1.7 billion euros.
The leader of the UBS Administrative Council of Oswald Grübel, a well-known ban not only in Switzerland, had to go.
the President of the UBS Management Board has been considered as suffering - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally returning?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will repeat the administration chairmanship already in May - not in 2013, as the bank made on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it becomes difficult.
It is not a ban, a much more economy teacher and the President of the Bank, and it would certainly have needed an adjustment period.
Only once, he is responsible for a bank's strategy, which has just proved more than she has deserved the title of the "the largest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
In fact, the UBS is on one large side - up to recently, she was the biggest manager of assets in the world, and on the other hand, she has suffered for years from a scandal to another.
Nothing, he's, doesn't spare the Swiss' fierce bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss manager of assets, quiet and strong, but also rushed, was combined with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of investment.
So UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a easily client than any other world bank.
On the other hand, it had progressed as a investment bank in the ligue of the largest banks in the world.
That's the impression.
The ancient ban€ Hans Geiger and later a bank teacher for long years in Zurich ra: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students."
"In the current optical, we're wondering, how would I just have been able to get to this point?"
He deeply missed.
In 2007, it appeared that something wasn't turning around the UBS for the first time.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli returned in a surprising way, which was considered to be a high intellectual and a genial ban.
A few months later, we pressured for the reasons he had gone.
The bank division had flammed with sub-prime documents and had a cross on billions.
The UBS announced an increase in capital of 13 billion francs and made a cross above.
It has actually found investors, but sometimes before, they would have cut down the sours: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and a Arabic state fund, which had passed quietly, while it has never been learned its name.
However, it was only the first time.
In April 2008, it came to pass.
The bank had to announce again billion losses, and the President of the Board of Administration of Marcel Ospel, which was still the second administration Council of Switzerland, would return in 2006.
In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: UBS was, taking into account its investment errors, in the financial crisis before failure and must be saved by the State.
The National Bank has purchased the UBS of tens of billions of problems, and the Swiss Conference has given six billion francs for awardable obligations for which it could be a shareholder of the bank.
All Switzerland has been dropped - because she has noticed how dramatic it can be for a small country, to cover such large banks.
Finally, the 2007 UBS balance total increased more than five times the Switzerland economic performance (see graphic).
"We couldn't save UBS again," said the bank investigator, Geiger.
After the first disaster, he followed the second.
A few months ago, UBS has been captured because of a tax difference with America and has declared ready to acquire the data of the easily customer, which may have broken the tax with the Bank's help.
Furthermore, she accepted a payment of $780 million - to refund unjustified benefits from these operations with an increased amendment.
Thus, UBS has been more or less assistance to tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the price of discrimination.
After the scandal, the Swiss secret has no longer been the same.
It was followed by the head of the Administrative Board and the Chairman of the Administrative Board.
And the exode of customers' money.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: investment because of bad speculations and the management of assets because of the aid to tax fraud.
And as there was a little back to the calm, and as we thought, UBS would go out there, it followed this unfortunate story of title markets: one flaming title market of 1,7 billion euros before the bank realized that something was not going around.
And it is said: with the management of investment bank risks, this does not always work.
"In the case of Adoboli, it was found that the control of risks was too shortly changed," said Martin Janssen, economicist and Professor of Finance at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also safe: "The problem of UBS is that she has no risk control in hand."
However, it was exactly what the Swiss bans had taken for a long time their role, the guard of the great happiness of the world: not too big risks, but the security for money - and the world could be broken outside the Alpine Republic.
The stocks of the Swiss banks became the symbol of an unusual reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli are for a special noble chocolate.
The UBS center in Zurich will still partake with the solid click of the private Swiss bank - it is just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at the central garage of Zurich, which directly leads from the central garage to the Lake of Zurich, which himself is surrounded by the snowed tops of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, and the magazines are among the highest of Europe.
The bicycles like Tiffany's, they are found here among Swiss traditional stores like those of the Sprüngli Confession.
Since centuries of the Swiss banks have resided here: from the national bank by the Swiss credit palace to elitist private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the UBS entrance Hall by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are dressed with marble, before they are on the side of the bank's logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the client looks for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or other distance from the market - or delivered the two large Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss credit, as the leader of a Switzerland private bank finds.
He would prefer not read his name in the journal, finally as all Swiss bans he's doing business with the two large banks.
The UBS would become too large, especially in the investment, where the saxons would also be expanded.
Switzerland wouldn't have anything to say anymore.
"And yet, they have long been adapted to the morning of the saxons."
This was actually the Anglosaxon Investment Bank that changed the UBS, made high benefits and then debt: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the subpremium jungle as the Switzerland big bank.
The catastrophe became manifest on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants undertaken the largest salvation operation in the history of their nation," wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, the political men accepted to save the large bank from the failure.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bans, they see the problem particularly at the size of UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Switzerland banks concluded in a large group.
A bank has been created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and has been recorded a growth.
What has helped is that the two different pre-deceived banks of UBS have completed: a rich, but letherary, with a strong point of the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but some have already been stronger internationalized.
In time, international investment banks favored access to many money, with which they could turn a huge road.
Two names are associated with UBS ascension: Peter Wuffli, 2001-2007 UBS Group Chef, and Marcel Ospel, previously president of the Administrative Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said the bank investigator, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modesty intellectual, which is very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has been scared a way to the top with the bank's learning."
But Ospel would be trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have done a decisive error at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is fair: exhaustity has come before falling.
The UBS staff recalls the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group has always spoken the same word: detonating Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank of the planet.
She commanded the "League Tables" classifications, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of deals and transactions of mobile values, she played a very important role.
However, business advisers, who had the responsibility thereof, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the "Fixed Income" jargon, there would be a great difference in the largest banks.
UBS would have lacuses at the level of American hypothics products.
To complete this lacuna, UBS started in an aventure, which almost costed her life.
Increasing, it is the bank itself as a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime places that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and made the value documents based on the American hypothiatic loans - but that also maintained risks.
Even when other banks were looking down for a long time.
"In the sea 2007, while the US immobile market was in flames, UBS bought there," said Geiger, the specialist.
More euphory is greater the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave, when the end of the trials was more difficult than we thought.
Posts in UBS have become exhaustive and are still able.
Whoever leads the big bank has a almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all proposed business models have disappeared.
The bank investigator, Geiger, has already a idea: to end the investment bank, concentration on goods management, return to Swiss racines.
But the bank doesn't want to go so far.
However, the investment bank must be able to remain vital, as it is until now.
Thursday next, Sergio Ermotti's bank head wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian was only supposed to be in transition when the bank was separated with surprise from her pre-deceiver Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed: he must carry out the business of UBS, the Bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to restore the investment bank to the middle of the 1990s.
He cancels 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
Avec, what does she want to win money?
These are the questions which Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He said still only that he was going to look for a apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Intelligent corners spread in cities
In many places, fresh ones are considered as "fish problem" but experts claim that these very intelligent animals haven't been allowed to go away from towns for a long time.
Some love them, some others want to get away from them as quickly as possible. The corners belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplied because of the health and sound of animals.
An antidote against "the problem of birds" is not yet in view.
During the first Ostfriesian symposium on the corners, experts said that it is no longer possible to throw the cities.
Experts in all Germany decided on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in towns
Natural protectioners also based the cities' problems on the exode of special protected frequency: the use of chemicals in agriculture is further destroyed by traditional live spaces.
The chassing, manipulation and smoking of typical cowation trees made the birds life difficult.
The corners are under nature protection.
There are large colonies with more than 600 cowation couples in the Western Soest, in the northwest, among whom Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
In 2005, a controversy project had gained negative advertisements due to the mask of corneals in that region.
The critics found the capture of birds in pigs and their murder with particular brutal goats.
"Normal exhaustion, obviously, serves nothing," said the town planner and Leer landscape, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nids with the water under pressure or broken trees often produces adverse consequences, said Manfred Kaiser de Lahr at Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals go away, the large colonies divide themselves and spread themselves into other places."
It is imaginable only in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement houses or schools.
"We are obliged to live with them, we can't destroy them anymore."
The problem is not solved in cities without the periphery, according to Major Wolfgang Kellner de Leer's opinion.
Conceptable is a combination of the advancement of animals to averse conditioning and acrocheus offers to allow them to reinstall themselves elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethology, Uta Maria Jürgens had expected "info panels instead of tronchons" to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally best support a button in the face with a self-confidential dose."
Jürgens co-funded the Ascheberger-Educational Traveling Papers at Schleswig-Holstein, travel panels that inform the life of these very intelligent freaks.
This project was adopted in time by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "This is a great number of communications, these birds have much to say."
Intelligence and ability of animals are advanced: freaks use not only work tools to reach a rule but they themselves make their tools as work tools.
Ethologists at the University of Cambrie have recently tested four freaks, how the intellectuality of birds comes.
In a experience, the birds learned quickly that they would make a rock-scale with stones to reach a larve.
Without a lot of training, they had determined that a stone had to have some pregnancy and shape to make the platform floor.
In a second trial, the astusive corners then solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertical cyliner, the researchers had placed a small stone with a larve.
The birds couldn't reach their boat with their boat.
However, researchers had set rail lines to their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they cut down the small rock of the small cup.
Three of the four freaks have succeeded even from the beginning.

Personal mass disorder
The new book of Peter Englund offers deepness and generosity. The title "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Sadness: an intime story of the First World War), begins with a long list of persons that make your heart low.
An advice to start: take care of this page and make your bookmark.
In this Roman account of Peter Englund, this list of persons will be your GPS, a label during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and disappointed in the wounds of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel price of literature.
He wrote a book outside the community that he describes, with precision, as "a book of anti-History".
It conducts some names with, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors or discussions on strategies and materials.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains that a "book describes what it could do." There are "sensitives, feelings, experiences, and humor."
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes 20 men and women in wartimes more or less, both sides of war, young schools and botanists to scalers, with doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Others of war prisoners, some will lose members, become foolish or lose life.
Their lives are here as the clergy of a church: while some exciting, it's rejoicing.
The book of Peter Englund is separated from traditional history books.
It brings a denunciation to the idea that the First World War only resumes the terrible war of traced on the west front.
"Beauty and grief" describes well other war theaters: the Alpes, the Balkans, the East front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers presented in this book are under the rocks; a Christmas Pass in Egypt under the pyramides; tse-see mouths are an intravenous problem.
This book is exciting from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as a Katrina oragan who can curde it.
When canon shots get away, and you're a mother at home, you're staying or running?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been exhausted by suspects, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspirationist theories, dreams, couchmars and sounds."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a English nutrition in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young marine of the high-sea float.
Their stories are mainly drawn out of memories, letters and other already-handed documents.
The versions of their lives may be terrifying or passionate, but are more preserved by the collection of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them are aware of the privacy and the ability to get out of it.
By relating the history of a German school, Peter Englund wrote: "Substitute, everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false alumie, caoutcho imitation, paper bandages, wood buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "sheet made of cooking rice in the sheep's fat (and ends with a fake bone of wood) ; the tobacco produced with dry rain and dry skin of earthquake; seeds of wooden hair."
He states that "837 authorised replacement meat are registered in the production of socks. 511 replacement coffees are also found."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
A American recognizes his own pulsion towards the wildlife and says about war: "You feel that, after all, that's what men were intended, instead of sitting in a comfortable wheel, a cigarette and a whisky at hand, reading a journal or a best-seller, and rather than claiming that such a vernis is a synonym of civilization, and there is no barbar behind your empeised and clouded chemistry.
In contrast, a British soldier realizes that he is able to make it strong, and that no one will not notice it or give attention to it.
"When we are resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have a public," he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is comparable to "a secretly convicted man".
Other comments relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict becomes increasingly a story of economic competition," Peter Englund wrote, "a war between companies."
He takes the archae of what he calls "a new species within the beast of the beginning of the century: the death of a well-anticulated mass and convinced ideally, in well-breasted clothing, which exempts his mouth while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; both basic behavior and heroism are found.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried to get a Venerian disease with prostitutes to avoid service at front.
"We find the greatest expression in the merchant to gonorrhee, which soldiers buy and stand on genital organs in the hope of ending at the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperates apply to it on the eyes, which is translated by a life-feeding."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is soft but not obstinating, perfectly adapted to his humanity task.
In decades of short scenes, he introduced the way war had "d'on controlless forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion. "
People start wondering why their leaders make them a war.
The best works from the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Me" (The Great War and Modern Memory) of Paul Fussel, or "Nothing again", of Erich Maria Note, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's book is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most appealing thing I have read in an unfunctional work.
I'm not gonna reveal it.
But it's as if he had come out of his book, enter this page from your hands where the list of people appears and burns with an alumet.
Following a first fake step, a minutely planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some with antiemeute casks.
The Monday night was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all other other than some high placed officers and other informed from the beginning they were going to take an exercise.
The Commissioner of the Police Raymond W. Kelly was in the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Department of Police.
There could not be repeated episodes in the last weeks, such as the use of powder gas against manifestants, who have gone against the Department Regulation and have produced a solidarity storm for demonstrants.
The operation aimed at cleaning the Zuccotti park of its manifestants was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared by watching employment in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive a better training against emissions - anti-terrorist measures which are consistent to quickly move a large number of police officers - to meet the Lower Manhattan quarter.
The last training session was held on Monday evening, on the East River side of Manhattan.
The orders given to move to the park were " at the last minute ", said a customer referring to the operation as " a simple exercise ".
"Some of the police I know and who were called not to go to the Zuccotti park," the person said anonymously.
"The only to know that they would go there are at the top of the Police Department's hierarchy."
The city had a lesson, from which the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, the police wanted to clean the park, but they took up hundreds of demonstrants informed about the plans.
The operation of Tuesday included officers of various police units, including operational forces of the whole quarter - tens of officers used to specially-special quarters.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, so one hour of the morning was a pleasant hour.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park counted at least people," he said.
The vehicles of emergency services equipped with spots and high talkers were gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Pont, before intervention.
The recorded lights and messages that reveal high speakers seemed to intimid the manifestants.
While the Community business officers would penetrate in the park equipped with their blue-vends, many manifestants simply collected their business and left.
No tent has been touched before 1 h45 the police said, which left time to the employees to raise their business.
Other police teams were recorded on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park have been forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the physician of the Department of Police, claimed that this measure had been taken only by security.
But, according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from keeping the intervention inside the park, which was cruelly held by officers.
Mr. Browne said that the television camera trucks presented on the Church Street, on the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved towards the west through the bullets of manifestants' business areas, including bagages, plastic gasolines and feed sacks filled with clothing, teams of the Success sanitary department, cleaning everything that the employees left behind them.
Some demonstrants who have left have been trained. The images have been spread on the Internet a little while after.
The main group of manifestants took place near the camp cuisine, not far from the centre of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A decree of people at the epicter of the camp has been crossed in.
Finally, two people were bound to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The emergency services were called to cut the strings.
There was no arrest in the park before 3:30, Mr. Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about one hour and four later.
According to Mr Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most of the "powerful trials and rebellion".
Joseph J. Es ́o, head of the Department of Police, is the most degree of officers to be found on the places.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, even though now, "not managed the operations" said Mr. Browne.
A second group of cops suffered along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were placed on the Cortlandt Street, a houseboat north of the park, as well as on the Pine Street, south.
We saw the police expanding the perimeter well beyond the Zuccotti park.
Several officers, most of the bottles equipped, would even have been seen to push people to remote them.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the livest actions of the night has been carried out in the south of the park.
About 5 a.m., on the south of Pine Street, a manifestant dropped on the capote of a police car. Others were seen to bury a police truck.
At a moment, a bath of contraplace arose by flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a manifestant were hospitalized.
School assistance syndicate continues the city for licences
The syndicat that represents hundreds of school aids who lost their employment in the last month provides for midnight a process for unusual and discriminatory licences. The impact is disproportionated on schools receiving defavorized schools.
Prosecutions are probably the latest arm of the 37th district Council, to try to make licences.
Six hundred and twelve school aids, parent coordinators and other employees, who were part of the least payable in the city, lost their employment on 7 October, and the syndicate leaders compared these licences to a political vengeance so that they did not leave the city to access a health fund managed by workers groups, which would have allowed to close the budget art at the last time.
The municipal authorities rejected this.
In an audience of the municipal Council last month, Channel Dennis Walcott stated that licences were part of the locked budget in June.
A member of the Council replied that the licences for school aid were no longer spending in the budget.
The 37th District Council officials said that they would comply with an opinion of a claim, warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference will be organized on Thursday to officially announce the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis Walcott and the department of the city's education will be the defence party. The complaints will be represented by eight licensed employees, all of the black or origin of Latin-American, such as most of the school aids that have lost their employment.
Elizabeth Thomas, speaker of the city's legal department, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons of the proceeding and thus cannot make comments on claims.
According to a decline of complaints received by the New York Times, the syndicat would put on the number of licences in the most defavorized quarter schools in the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, explaining that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to a regular subfinancing.
While there is no license on Staten Island, and some of the Upper East Side facilities or TriBeCa, 17 school aids lost their employment in the 23th district of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th districts of the south districts of Bronx.
Noteing the loss of five school aids on eight employed at Harlem 36, where 68% of the schools live in poverty, followers claim that "It is not a quarter of easily parents who can bring funds to the deficiency of the budget."
The 36th budget was reduced by 3.26% this year, and funds were also lost when the city changed its additional funding calculation for each defavorized inscription.
The syndicat also states that school directors were able to be misled by some terms in a memo authorising the license of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term "over" to describe the action, even if "over" generally describes the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaint, "sixty-six parent coordinators have been licensed" and "not only because of overcoming".
Mission completed: The Congress finds an agreement on the issue of Libya
Finally, it would be that the Republicans and the Democrats had found an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the elevation in Lybia.
There will be a successful survival, capture and death of the long-term dictator Muammar Kadhafi, as well as the American implication.
The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senat will take a decision next Wednesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democracy - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arʹna) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), appreciating the Libyan people for their rebellion and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution consists of honoring the courage of the Libyans while they begin rebuilding their country," John Kerry said.
"It is bipartian support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be inevitable, but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This year, two parties' issuers have been in conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to authorize limited employment of American military forces in Libya.
The draft law has been won by a wide bipartsane margin and has never voted in the Senat.
However, on the same day of the failure of the draft law, the House of Members also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of American operations in Libya.
The American mission has therefore remained as a islative purgatory - the Congress quite contrary to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut her grass under his feet.
The Indecision of the Congress has been overcome by events.
Tripoli was fallen under the insurance in aula and Kadhafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senat can act now.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for its great courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates men and women of the American armed forces and their partners of coalition involved in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their fantastic courage and professionality."
The resolution also states "the United States' national interest to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure receive all the support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate or divide the islators as last in June?
The Senator and President of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the last version.
His portfolio stated last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the last version of the new project.
In the Chapter, the House must vote on a amendment to the Constitution this week for a balanced budget, a islative priority for almost all the Republics of the Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other question, to a vote to the House or to the Senate.
Other islators have not yet been able to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.
The amendment of Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been submitted to the Congrès on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrents - the same draft law proposed both at the Room and at the Senat - and others are deeply changed by one.
At least 15 versions of the amendment for a balanced budget are included in the Chamber only, and another deficiency that " would control the federal expenditure".
Some of these legislative projects are identical, but they give support to their support - including the new Republicans who want to suffer their CV - the chance of being "the author" in such a measure.
The Law on Budget Control Act adopted lastly requested the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 Senators were voted for an unbinding resolution supporting the idea of such amendment.
Besides the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates during which the members of the Congrès can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrate - New York) wants to decrease the limit of two mandates for the Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democracy - Illinois) proposed a series of amendments to ensure the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
A amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is permanently proposed, as the amendment prohibiting the pollution of the flag.
Some islators also want to authorise the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the States are opposed to them.
Thus, as the members were to offer amendments, they are not as quick as the past.
At the 111th Congress, the Islators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at 110th.
The period was relaxed at the beginning of 1990, when the members generally proposed more than 150 amendments each two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senat library.
But these amendments have not been much more successful than today.
The last amendment to have been made - 27th was held in 1992 but proposed at the Congress in 1789.
Gabrielle Giffords said "Massacree but note" during its first television interview since the fusillade
Ten months after a armed man shot him at the end of Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democracy - Arına) appeared on Monday evening in a television emission, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said that he wanted to return to the Congress before all.
When she appeared in the television journal "20/20" on the ABC chain, near Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struck to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The emission was too difficult to return after the ball that broke his brain and switched the left side of the brain through the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the Room of Representatives to vote on the debt.
During his first television interview since January's fusillad, who killed six people and hurt thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, ried and sang - and qualified its "difficulty" restoration.
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, answered "only well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaute Mark Kelly, occurred at a special edition of "20/20" hour, spread the guard of the output of the new book of the couple titled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special emission has retraced Gabrielle Giffords' reinstallation since January 8th.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, he was seen at his hospital bed, racial head and a wide cicatrice on the front.
She comes to use only one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragements.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a rolling wheel while doctors learn to exhibit simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A mouse of lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords shot another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his little breakfast.
The videos distributed by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' restoration: the Representative is being seen with the doctors by Cyndi Lauper Air "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spent two hours each day with the doctors, said not to remember the fusillade.
According to her husband, he was reading a article on the fusillade of March 12 when she stopped and asked for the first time information about the six persons killed during the accident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, was arrested in a prison of Missouri and was treated in the waiting for the trial.
"There were many dead," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
When she was restored, Mark Kelly said to Diane Sawyer, she said, "I've been used."
"I would say, " Gabby, you haven't been earned," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out of it, restore yourself and get back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for troops
Event: a gala in Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for the veteran without home from New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballade on impugnation, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, marines, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in costum-cravate stood at his feet to acclamate it.
"The soldiers, men and women, are viewed as heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the first-year fund collection.
A high-graded military officer present in the gala, who also participated in Amiral Mike Mullen, head of the United States armies, saw the role of the groups in different ways.
"They were presented as a kind of orphelin," wrote the military high-grade in a electronic court.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just mercy.
Absolutely contradictions illustrate the difficult relations between military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, saying some military.
The public acts more and more as if he was sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not of all the victims," said general brigadier Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it would be that the only way to support us is to support us in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, which do not want to appear inconsistent or in agreement with the public they serve.
They also realize that the wrath of the returning troops of Vietnam war was much worse.
Thus, most of the discussions on pity have been held in all confidentiality among the veterinarians.
After the return of his two sons of the fight against the Marines, the retraite colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insured ones and traveled to remote countries.
Others would wonder if "a wrath and violent veteran is hidden under the surface " said Cancian, who was in Iraq and returned to work at the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who made him cross the interviews were subtilely asked if he was able to be able to take a job stress in Washington immediately after his return to the fight.
"When you address the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative initiatives," reminds Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military are in part from the United States increasing organization towards wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a small country in the family with the army and sees little direct benefits of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate heroism in the same way as for the Second World War " states the General Lieutenant Retraite David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and people are largely focused on the depth of a military soldier's souffrances.
The groups are recognised for the number of sustained service periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of wounds.
Army faced by the growing pressure of severe violence
This week, a capital audience will decide whether 28 men and women will proceed against the army for an inaction imposed on violence.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
The first Elizabeth Lyman soldier was 25 years old and was 11 weeks in the night where she claims that a soldier was violated.
It was in October 2008. She returned to her cabinet at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, when she met a beer package.
He asked him if he could join her in his room to drink a drink.
"C" was a signal of alarm," Elizabeth Lyman says.
But Texane put her anxiety on her side.
I thought he was 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after he was entered into the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man catched him behind, casted by the ground and violated, before it.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and other no, will be in anxiety waiting for the judgment of justice during a historical trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a sentence against the former secretary to the defence of Robert Gates and his pre-debater, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
These are accused of not stoping the generalization of violence within the army, taking into account the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, was the case of 17 complaints. This number increased to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, everyone claims that they have been violated or abuse sexually by soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, continued or providing justice adapted after alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says to take them to the Galonian military, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in position to eradicate the culture of repressions? The leaders."
The lawyer also states that since the month of February, it has been contacted by almost 400 other people, most of them could be part of future juiz prosecutions.
His strategy: instead of racing all the complainants in this case - putting all its eggs in the same packaging - it will intend several processes, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defense Team for the Department of Defence, managed by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, gave an invitation to reject the case.
The Judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and mainly the fact that the army cannot be continued by soldiers in service or not for wounds caused in armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme Court, named the Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the injury of the active staff.
"The offence is inherited to the military service of the complainants " indicating the documents.
The Department of Defence has made all comments.
The things have changed since the 50s.
While women still have, officially, the right to fight, this distinction is only recorded on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, women's military teams play a more important role, especially to contact local women.
Result: In these two wars, 150 soldiers lost life - two thirds in the fighting situation.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
It is not alone to fight: three other proceedings are in progress.
In Yale's rights, the veteran legal service center prepares a matter against the four main military academys in order to promote a misogyn environment.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America's non-profit foundation prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the "personal distress" to the victims of violence to grant them - a relatively related fact, the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network (First Women's Action Network), a group of human rights.
His group intended a procedure to the Veteran Administration in December, with discriminatory practices in the way of dealing with the requests of advantage for people who declared have been victims of sexual agression in the service.
Nine independent law projects were submitted to the Congress by a bipartial mixing of senators and representatives, which proposed several solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual agressions were registered by the Department of Defence’s Intervention and Prevention Centre (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office).
However, it is well known that the number of sexual agressions is under estimation. In fact, according to Pentagone's own estimation, this number represents about 13,5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report in March also studys the percentage of Judge Prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army were subject to a trial - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants of Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumatisms.
In the case of Lyman, she reports to the military police of violence less than one hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to report 11 times in detail her violation to different police, doctors and commanders.
She bound a "rape kit" (literally a kit of violence), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge, at a trial during which it was questioned about its sexual relations with his little friend soon as the day of his aggression.
Six people have proved as a witness of morality for the crime author, which has finally been purchased.
"I remember the day the sentence was made," Elizabeth Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to start having contracts, and I started crying after the court."
"I was placed in psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember saying to my commander, "It was not his trial but my."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatric, which ended with a disaster of personality, making it inappropriate to the service.
In January 2010, it was sent with less than honorable terms, preventing any benefit.
Is the case of Lyman and other complaints going on or not, it's a long story, says John Turley, professor of right to the Droit University of Washington.
However, he notes, "I think they should be able to progress."
Only this criticized doctrine since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized Doctrine Feres.
The army is in decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of disappointment of responsibility.
"The chances are hard against them... but it's important that they try," he says.
These things change only when good people have the will of themselves.
If the sentence does not turn to their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer's lawyer, will raise its hundreds of other complainants for other proceedings.
"We will continue to stand against the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Where until we die, one or another of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before become the new face of the right extreme in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who was part of his anti-immigration opinions online.
Monday, Breivik, who was recognized to have been taken by a murdered fool in Norway in July of 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far away from being on the cyberspace: he had passed a large part of the time that attacked his owner, to discuss with some of the million nationalists who support the extreme right groups on social network sites.
After the tragedy of this year, researchers want to learn more about these people.
But how can you find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report of the Demos's meditation group on the digital population in Europe.
Facebook regrets so many personal information, Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to find the people they are looking for with a scientific precision - the way the sea sciences do it for years.
The team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that half million members are fans of the right-hand extreme groups in Europe, which aimed them with announcements, but instead of connecting them to a new group or product, the announcements invited users to respond to an investigation. The issues concerned their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism on their own future.
In contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his guards could ask 10,000 parties from 14 extents in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way to make research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprisingly: the online parties of the right groups are men, young people, and against immigration.
But amazingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer."
The DeMOS study is only an example of how Facebook has become the new incontourable tool in the hands of scientists.
Review groups, medical researchers and policologists use the site to study all subjects that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I love", publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users with average three contents daily, the "supernova of data" generates a research explosion, increaseing the number of research travels that the site's name appears at almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the benefit of Facebook is that it allows you to study people that you can't approach the street.
"Before, when you tried to make surveys on the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should have gone to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," Jamie Bartlett said.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and treat health and social problems.
According to a recent study of the D. Megan Moreno at Wisconsin-Madison University, and of its students, young students who talked on Facebook of their exploitants in the state of abroad had much more opportunities to be alcoholic than discrete students.
Megan Moreno suggests that students, such as advisers, will monitor the site and intervene in order to help a student whose status would speak too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't do it," Dimitri Christakis, co-developer of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, states Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children with risks, and they would not be in another case recognizing."
Facebook also continues to accept information from its users.
The website's data team studied statistics about the loving situation and the day of the Holy Valentin, the rate of participation in the elections of the mi-mandat 2010 and a national happiness index (with only information available - digital freedom campaigns supported for a long time that the site could provide its data stock to others for research).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, that it pleases or does not - in exchange to play Scrabble with a friend who is at thousands of kilometers, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a question they haven't even heard?
While researchers have well-defined consigns about how to collect information other than using the Internet, there is anything else online.
"I don't think that a lot of users have already thought that a researcher can study their profile," Neil Selwyn, sociologist in the Londres Cognition Laboratory, after a 2006 study that he has conducted by watching Facebook walls of his students.
"When they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then the question of methodology comes.
Even without the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is fully honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things," Neil Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a block-notes and a ́lo remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing will be able to replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies should be addressed to social aspects - and social, it is not before a .
"Froid and inhuman" means the first comparison of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to have organized the two attacks that killed 77 killed in Norway this year, was described as a fighter of "resistance" during his first appearance to the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander for the movement of Norwegian Resistence and the Temples of Norway," he explains before a hearing room of 500 people.
"In respect of the jurisdiction of the court, I complain it, because you have your mandate of organizations supporting a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I'm not guilty."
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologe because "he didn't want to let him use this process to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he left Breivik, who brought with him a talk on paper, talking to the victims' parents at the end of the audience.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in prison for twelve weeks later, prohibited him to speak with media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
There were 30 parents of surroundings and victims in audience.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be put behind the bars.
All participated in the audience in view of the end of the judgment.
"I found it cold and inhuman" said a survivor of Utoya at the Norwegian TV chain NRK.
"I wasn't in appeal, but I personally had a little advanced after I saw and heard the suspect."
With a shadow costum and a blue cravate, Breivik remained calm and professional during the whole trial. He looked at the journalists and surroundings in the eyes in and out of the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a wide "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy, and he also said that there is no evidence that he had acted with complices.
The attempts of 22 July are therefore the work of an extremist instead of a whole group of radicals, which may be comfortable for certain.
But this does not reduce the suffering or confusion that the whole nation feels.
"I would have preferred him to do anything to a monster, but that's not the case," said a parent of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons of Steve Jobs' interview lost in the film this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing by the technical genius and inventor of modern information.
But what the fans can find more evident in a maintenance of Steve Jobs found recently and that will be distributed this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative spirit had understanded the processes and work flows of the products.
He was no doubt a Creator and a dreamer. He was identified to a hippie but was also very medical and organized, as well as a organizer - a man who believed that many business leaders would suffer from a "maladie who let them think that a genial idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a significant quantity of handwork separates a genius idea of a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series retraces the computer's birth, and he was sitting with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he says that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It's just after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the performance garage.
This video is the foundation of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be distributed on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate deep entrepreneurships, Steve Jobs ○ here amazingly enthusiast to expose philosophy and his commercial strategies.
And incroy's careful.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come for a long time after questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of thinking, during which Steve Jobs cares for his thoughts, in order to bring a specific answer.
It is also discovered when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurrects, where he is impatient to hear Cringely's questions, giving him cooking to make it accelerate and to get to questions or subjects of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, a strange aspect of Lost Interview is found. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and is part of his own view of the future of the information.
It's a thing to read the posthume reviews of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something brutal and inspiring on the man we see here, the anxious dream at the guard of size.
He has a view of how things can be and must be.
He explains them and then puts them into practice.
Here is a quick recapitulative of seven notable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to conduct a company:
"All these years, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers are continually the same: "Oh, just because you have to do it."
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I discovered.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details about his efforts to simplify the accountability of Apple.
Perplexous about the way the costs were stored - often begins by a "standard" evaluated for nose, and then adjusted with a "--" - he developed a automaticized company that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
About the opportunity to play a tour to Papa:
Steve Jobs ra's anecdote of the "BlueBoyte" that he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that served to pirate the phone networks and phone freely in long distance.
The device has made the subject of many writings to the preliminary, but Steve Jobs' euphory here in his description of the Blue Box as an appropriation act is contagious.
He describes the way he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, guarding a call then connecting from a AT&T network to another whole by rounding as many satellites as possible.
"We developed the ball of different things a half twelve times, and you broke on the public phone, and it came to you a minute later at the public phone nearby," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something able to control billion dollars of infrastructure worldwide."
We didn't know much about both of us, but we knew to invent a little thing that could control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that there would be a day without that.
Steve Jobs continued to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak put in mind: he phoned at Vatican with the Blue Box in the beautiful middle of the night by going through Henry Kissinger and asked to talk to Papa.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are convocated in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomate, the two complaints are crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is wake up.
About her love with la (and Bill Hewlett's departure):
At the age of 12 years, on the chassing of pieces to manufacture a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the calendar and takes a shift.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a noteworthy influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age, and this made my definition of a company and how the employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratorys in Palo Alto, where he covered the "first officer ever designed".
He was as big as a valise, had a catholic tube, and I fell loving.
The teenager I was returned to HP and began to write programs for this machine.
Improving innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about winning new products on a headquarters.
At the beginning of his career, while he is installed to sell a few printed circuit cards, a customer asks him to have a complete holder.
Only 30 days of credit, the assembly and the delivery of finished equipment should be taken into account.
Later, with Apple, he remembers difficulties to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember big disputes... I was crying over as a speaker that I need five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a conceptor."
Four and twenty days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that would be increyable.
On the large enterprises that are covering:
Before he did not make Apple live, Steve Jobs had predicted how many industrial leaders would be throwing and losing control from their market part.
"Let us admit you worked at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copy or a better printer, and then?"
You have the market monopole, so the company doesn't have any success.
Venture and marketing can develop it, so [this are the types of people] that end by leading undertakings and the product-specialised staff are put to the art of decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopol position is completely broken by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have been able to hold all the computer industry.
She could have made its current size ten times. Xerox would have been the Microsoft in the 90s...
They bought the defect to the victory.
Innovation as an artistic form:
"A large part of manual work separates a genius idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn greatly about its subtilities.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, machines, too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (the concepts) by gathering them together.
Finally, the decisions are taken by go personal. It is to try to expose you to the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso said one day the good artists copy and the big artists want.
We're always ashamed of stealing fine ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on were musicians, poetes, zoologists, historians, who simply had the best scientists in the world.
If it was not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of the right of health while the court is meeting
On the day when the Supreme Court meetings closed to the question of political discourse, which is whether the opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Thomas, were noted at a dinner at the lawyers' cabinet that will defend the matter before the High Court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges meet for a conference to discuss petitions for examination.
One of the cases concerned was a trial intended by 26 states who contest the reform of the ambitious health care voted by the Congrès last year, which was a point of dealing with the national military soldiers.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a 5:30 monumental argument is expected in March Next, and the result will probably be of nature to promote the destabilization of the presidential course of 2012, which will be in full exciting at the time when the court's decision will be made.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will be like Paul Clement, who served as a general applicant of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The Clement legal cabinet, P.C. Bancroft, was part of two dozens of cabinets that helped to eat the annual dinner of the Federal Society (Federalist Society), a long-term group assigned to defend the conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet, Jones Day, represents one of the trades that contested the law, the National Federation of independent enterprises (National Federation of Index).
Another promotor was the pharmaceutical gentle Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial injury in the result of the litigation.
The dinner was at a hotel of Washington a few hours after the conference of the court on the case.
It was, among others, Mitch McCon, the top of the Senat and the opposite stated about the health law.
The guests watch at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been presented to the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there is nothing to do with deontology rules.
In fact, judges are exempted from conduct code that regulates the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would certainly argue by Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may assist fund collections of organizations related to law and other, although the judge cannot be an interventor, an honorable guest, or on the programme of such event."
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the lawyers of the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was ready to alarm the activists of the government ethical ethics.
"This violation of ethical and great indifference in relation to the code contradicts the statements of several judges as the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause.
"The judges bu and dinner and a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have cases in the court."
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds of this event decreases any claim of impartiality, and it is inacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little attention to critics claiming that they are too easily mixing the court's business with the group agenda such as the Federal Society.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a high-profile military.
Moreover, the conservators claim that Judge Elena Kagan has a ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general applicant for the administration of Obama when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the court of the first instance.
Her critics pressured Kagan to hear the case, saying that she was too invested in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for online aircraft
The Air Company Emirates commands 50 Boeing 777, bi-cooling aircraft, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sell six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market estimated more than a billion dollar.
There is nothing extraordinary for a company to receive a command containing 50 of its products.
However, it is a matter when the company concerned is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and that the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of $18 billion.
It is also incredible that Boeing has received this command: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future flying orders.
In Monday forecasts, the Chicago company considers that the Middle-East aircraft companies will need in the next 20 years of 2 520 flying a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed the most dear commercial aircraft command in his story - 50 Boeing 777 bi-kloirs.
It's the aircraft Emirates based on Dubai who passed this Pharaoh order.
Boeing announced at Dubai Airport Room of 2011 that the aircraft is also able to buy 20 more plans, which would be the total amount of the order at $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated that Oman Air commanded six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model of important fuel and commodities for passengers.
The amount of these six devices is more than one billion dollars.
"It is very positive for Boeing," Neal Dihora, an analyz of Morningstar.
"These customers especially have a great value."
In the Middle East, oil producers countries have many of their aircraft companies.
Therefore, they have not only the means to pay these aircrafts, but also a summary of the fuel price - of damageable habit for air companies because it represents their most important costs - it would not be so damaged to them because the country would win money with the oil price mounted.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others of a• or to distinguish their plane orders when the oil price increases, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The Emirates command strengthens Boeing's predomination on the market of large-porting airplanes and helps to free the temptation of the Airbus competition with its A350 airplane.
The victory of Boeing at the airport room arrives four months after the announcement of Airbus to report the beginning of the largest version of A350, which directly rivals with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus repairs its beginning to increase the movement on the basis of the request of its clients to increase its loading capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's actions increased by 1.5% to reach $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican President manifestly to the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon says that drug traffickers have helped her opposer Fausto Vallejo du PRI in the course of the Governing Board.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has lost its attempt to access to Michoacán's Governor's functions during violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of its opposers.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was headed for the course of the Governing Board of the West State.
"The intervention of crime organized during all the voting process and particularly yesterday is a alarmant fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon reported at the radio during an interview on Monday after elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... they took up urnes, installed road bargage... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The Pris governed Mexico for sixty-twenty years to lose the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo was noted only for a little time in Calderon, who was headed for the reviews before the election day.
Calderon, candidate to the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, has recognized Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, Left candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently occupies the Governor's functions, has occurred the third, a penalty before the presidential of 2012 for this divided and unfortunate.
Aureoles also recognised the first results.
Vallejo, the former Master of Morelia, the capital of the State, has denied all relations with drug traffickers and has strongly advised the other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has been dominated for a long time by specialized drug cards in marihuana, heroin and metamphetamine trafficking.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offence against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence continued.
A week before the elections, a major of the PAN was disabled while he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates returned locally to the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI, both corrupt and Michoacán's elections have air, a victory will help the party in his elephant.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the course of the presidential, Enrique Pena Nieto, welcomed Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraged for the next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to assist in the euro area
The Asian Development Bank asked India and China to prepare for the euro area to help out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid long-term decrease that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director-General of the BASD based in Manille, said that the two economic powers for the fastest growth in the world "to do all that is in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties of an "independent eye" and reported that a Asian financial support by the leaders and resources of Europe would be allowed to avoid long-term evasion of the global economy.
"We're all in this crisis."
"Therefore, whoever can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," he said to Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bobay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain point but it is not open."
"If China and India can help, nothing will prevent them."
In recent months, the euro area has been severely exhausted by a crisis of the sovereign debt.
Recently, the cost of the Italian premium has been dangerous and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have released.
The flowing crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe made the fear that the global economy would not return back in recession, and encouraged the call for the main economys to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag claimed that the FMI would take all Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - as to buy the obligations of the United States Financial Saving Fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - would offer a greater power of negotiations to the Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, said that "India will do all that she can" to help the euro area since its own economy now suffers from a decrease of exports and deterioration of foreign capital income.
"Nobody wants the euro area to remain instable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to rise and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"What isn't a choice, it's a imperative, because where will we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others stress that development economys such as India should not help European riches while they face their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically difficult to accept an aid in Europe at 1.2 billion Indians, whose at least 800 000 lives with $2 per day, even less.
"Every day, they will find out that the Greeks take their 50-year retirement and leave in vacation to the sun and they will have a bad deal with it," he reported.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reservations should be used to maintain many Greek employees well paid in wrong-handled jobs that generate losses, such as in the railway sector.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis in the euro area could cause " significant impacts" throughout Asia.
The previsions of the BASD of a economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now confronted with "the risk of loss" due to European threats.
He noted that vulnerable markets needed to "build "security plans" to protect themselves from economic return and significant capital flights.
Severe Pentagone warnings on potential defence reductions
The Defence Secretary, Leon Panetta, pressed the Monday Congress, warning that imminent automatic budgetary compressions would know the national security, and has made a reaction in the financial chain of the Pentagon collars to the Afghanistan battle fields, with civil races.
The Pentagone already deserves $450 billion for the next decade, but fears now that an additional amount of $600 or more of compression is imminent if the Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Ar'na, and Lindsey Graham, R-Suth Carolina.
He stated that the failure of the Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from the name of sequestration would lead to 23% reductions, as well as the ice of many new projects.
"A so important reduction, so applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and inexactable building projects - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and have seriously reached other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be obliged to separate ourselves from a number of our civil staff and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost have to send civilians in conjunction without salary in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would enlarge the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect combating troops, continued Panetta.
"When the financing in war accounts of foreign contingency operations is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delay in contracts and the supervision of contracts supporting war."
"The employee managing the salaries would be reduced, providing delays of payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators had written in Panetta 10 days ago, requesting details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Defence Minister.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defence would have caused a rapid decline of the United States as a worldwide leader of military power."
"We are fairly opposed to this draconic action," Senators said in a common Monday afternoon during the publication of the Panetta letter.
"It is not a consequence that we can live with, and it is certainly not that we should impose."
"Sequestration is a threat to the United States' national security interests, and it should not have to happen."
That the letter of Panetta and recent warnings of Senators increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or a call to free the Pentagon of reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta was more virtual about possible compressions, even if it has reached the most high post of the Pentagon, coming years of budget expertise in Congrès and the White House, and knowing that it was confronted with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Secretary has drawn a shadow table of what could happen - a military with a cocktail but not a noise.
"It's a ship without marine."
"It's a brigade without balls."
"It's a flight, without enough pilots."
"It's a paper tigre, a caiser army, buildings and bombs that have not enough soldiers who are able to carry out the mission," Panetta said at its preliminary comments in Pentagone.
"It's a depressed, badly prepared force and impossible to face potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites the agression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta expressed specifically how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time of response to crisis, conflicts and disasters; serious limits to our ability to explore and engage us in the world; and risks are not acceptable in future fight operations."
And Panetta stated that some of the largest defence projects could go to the cover, including those already tested and some just at the first stages of the planning.
This list included Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bombarder, the Balistic sub-sea of new generation, the new ship of literal fighting and the new land vehicle, which would replace the Army and Marine Humvee.
A term for F35's development and testing could generate $80 billion for 10 years, but its parties say that it is a essential step for improvement and response to the potential threats of China and others.
How to find a lie
A view of recent manchettes indicates how thrombocy and lie are all present in the daily life.
The Republican candidate to the Presidentship of Herman Cain is occupied with exchange of sexual charitable claims with several women; each side is lying.
The Penn State administrators have been accused of payment for the reports which have been covered by a football carrier to the retraite sexually aggressed boys.
Last week the French president Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by a open microphone to the American President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the Clebrity of the Internet Anthony We ____________________________________________________________________________________________________
The former candidate to President John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of campaigns related to the covering of an extra-human connection.
And then, none of the people who have vowed the story will never forget the median circle that President Bill Clinton has started in his second mandate on his sexual implication with Monica Lewinsky.
The trichery stories at the tests of the oil and the university are aware.
There were cases where teachers gave the responses of tests to the tests in order to make sure their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message, which lies and trickery are acceptable.
How many troops do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are godly lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or finding lies is an essential competence that everyone must purchase, both for personal and professional reasons.
Instead of being a social game similar to, say, chardas, where the goal is to be: "I have you," the discovery of troppery is a serious knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades in prestigious universities who have conducted a deep research in such projects, especially in psychology and physology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths on the lie have been demystified.
Lighters look at you in your eyes.
They're not kidding, red, or not always acting.
Don't conclude that men are difficult to detect and difficult to dismiss.
A qualified lying detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the micro-expressions, the training of the question and the time of response.
I have spent several years to examine scientific results in the broad body and always excite knowledge of troppery, and it is implied that the detection of troppery is a modern competence that is easier and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibility includes embauch, interviews, negotiations or management.
The good mentors are able to read the others well, by putting them in mind, by manageing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others understand them.
We know from research that extravertises lie more than introvertises, than men say more lies "centered on them" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people lie less often to their partners than not married people (but the lies they raise are tend to be big).
We also know that if you are considered as an unbeliever, the others will feel less guilty to lie to you.
How can you say if someone lying?
All over, observe the normal behaviour of your subject.
That's what we call "building data reveal".
This helps provide a reference point to measure the later changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laughing, vocal quality.
You must know if someone normally removes his feet permanently so that you don't start injustices when you're going to remove the feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for instructions of false and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these indications as red flags, not the evidence of the trompery.
The foolish people can immobilize the body's top when they are trying to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, pick up to an output, change a significant posture or present a "post-interview" lighting - an exagered supper, a posture change when all difficult issues have passed.
Questioners often falsely indicate that the maintenance has been completed just to seek to start the post-interview reaction.
Therefore, take care of the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson deceived by using the past all in advertising that his wife was alive, starting a national research to find her.
The foolish persons can also use a remote language: "I have no sexual relations with this woman... Mrs. Lewinsky" or repeat a completely difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtil.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to say true... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceived answer rather than fatal and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize trooping is possible.
These skills will improve the opportunities for anyone to avoid victimization by anger in their professional and personal life.
The controverse oil plan will be deployed after the late approval threat of the United States
A few days after the administration of Obama threatened to delay the approval of a oil project between Canada and Mexico Golf - providing the wrath of the syndicates while relaxing the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oleoduc says that it is ready to redirect the project to send it on the rails.
TransCanada stated on Monday evening that she would move the pipeline designed out of the Nebraska's area, and it is confident that the project will also win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference to the Nebraska Capitole.
The Officer of TransCanada, Alex Perbax, claims that the company remains confident that it will end with the approval of a oleoduc, but with a different road.
This results from the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal authorisation for the project until it receives new studies of potential travellers to avoid Nebraska's and Ogallala's underground water sources.
"It's a real way to the front," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental examination of the Department of State would probably have rejected any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officers refused the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State and expressed its support.
The 2,735 km oleoduc would be from Canada to Mexico golf.
He would transport 700,000 bars per day from the province of Alberta to the Texas raffiners.
To do so, he should cross six states.
It is hated by Ethiopians, but loved by working groups, which have placed on the 20 000 estimated jobs related to oleoduc.
But the islators of Nebraska, opposed to this plan, press a law for force the distance from the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala Academy, a major source of potable water and irrigation.
The environmental impact study during the Department of State found that the project would only have limited environmental negative impacts, but the energy industry said that the Ministry General Inspector ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is to know whether an undertaking that was emballed to conduct the initial study was an inadequate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle continues for prejudice caused a young child to worry
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle had her in a disturbance of violence in Manhattan's immortal Hall, feared their little girl at the point where she was afraid.
The tired of the song "Lady Marmalade" feared the 18-month-year-old Genevieve Monk, so that she made "the changes of personality, the trouble of sleep" and "the great fear of foreigners," she said during the court of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was on 10 November of the past year, while the Kevin Monk scene technician, his childhood teacher, Rosena, and Geneva, would be prepared for a family travel.
While Kevin Monk was going to search for the car, Rosons Monk descended down to the hall of their immobility of the Riverside Boulevard with their baggage with Genevave in his arms.
Roseons Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Anyone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said "yes" and I went to search for her," she said.
LaBelle advised the zealous woman with anger.
"He said to me about an aggressive ton, "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," Rosen Monk said.
"I answered him, "what you say or think you don't care about me."
She became angry and began to use jurns - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and began to stick me out of the bottle's water.
She said that at that point, Geneva became histerical.
"I said to this woman, "Remember what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself on her mother - who always holded Geneva in her arms - and had to be arrested by her surrounding that drew her into a car that waited for them, says Rosena Monk.
The little girl would weep so hard that she started to smoke.
Later, the family sent a note requesting excuses from LaBelle but received no answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives have not returned our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unexpected damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he took the case freely and that the family intends to give all money to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The objective is to maintain Patti LaBelle responsible for its conduct," Mr. Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally inacceptable, especially towards a mother teacher with a 18-month child."
Climate adversity has released the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment was decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year in which the economic history of Sinaloa will be remembered, this is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations for the progress of the economy, but because of the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the growth is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main economic development indicators.
The low temperatures of the fev, except for losses of billions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the State's growth economy, have caused a general contraction of economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, which is primarily justified by the history of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamic of other economic sectors.
According to the report of infections of irons issued by the Mexican Council of Supportable Rural Development, 582 million 835 hectares were harmful, whereas 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main polluted cultures were the ↓ums, the maize and the silk fish.
The decrease of economic activity has generated a constant increase in unemployment in the State until November, by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three quarters of the year, a accelerated increase was observed, since since January to March 55,053 synonyms were unemployed, with a rate of 4,53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second trimester the rate was 5,28 per cent and the average continued to grow up to 6,19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74,000 unemployment synonyms, an increase compared to the first semester of 18,000 969 people.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactoral, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources under the law approved in the Congrès to fight the whiteness of money, because for people who win dollars in a illegal way it is not easy to work to win them, to invest them and to use them in something," he said.
Migration captured
López Cervantes reported that the growth of unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the State to go to work foreign, in the United States has been limited because of input difficulties, and secondly because they already have many difficulties to find work, these people remain here and ask for work sources, which makes unemployment grow," he said.
Serious Missing
The analysis of the Sinhala labour market increases considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predomates between work conditions, the INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population occupied in this state, without covering it as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Besides the unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for discharge for the state is the lowest salaries, the entity has the lowest payments of the country, the registrations of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Work and Social Provision Secretariat.
The average monthly income of synonym workers was, until September, 5000 352 weights, very lower than the average national, which is 7000 375 weights.
IED contract
In addition to the decrease of the economic activity and the increase of unemployment, in 2011 the highest reduction of the investment in the Eastern Investment was recorded in the last 10 years, the Secretariat of Economy from January to June reached the State's IED 630 billion 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to 5 million 143 billion 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
At its turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17.280 billion weights per year, mainly registered by third-party companies.
Leave this
Since the economic contracting scenario, the Government of the State requested in July the public conference to approve a credit of 3 billion weights for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approving of the State's congress was 2.600 billion weights, and until November no benefit of the entity was observed in any sector of the State's economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of the patronal sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Room of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, as well as the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year was really very poor, we need to work intensely to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and especially the good way already synchronized of this new government team, hope that the next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as ice in the beginning of the year have held the state's economy and have limited its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including ice, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn quickly to generate a economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of e flow in the processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year, we are very lower than the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine Call
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronal Conference of the Republic of Mexico said that the State would be channeled to more dynamic production activities.
"In general, we have noted that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefinites the state's vocation and economic direction, because it is important that all the potential of Sinaloa's material and humid resources are deteriorated."
Many to do
The President of Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a future vision that improves Government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in various areas in the field of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of the policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware of the fact that there is much to do," he said.
Conduited for 8 kg of marihuana
A resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of amendment for eight kilograms of marihuana.
The General Park of the Republic informed that the small convicted trademan is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in its marihuana ownership variety for sale.
According to the case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by mexican Army officers on 7 June 2010 during a monitoring operation in the street Cipriano Valdez, before the number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafiquant was in a type pick-up truck, white, where he was transporting a black color sack in the vehicle port and on the childhot place a small back bag where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available by the Second District Court and the sentence is still located in the Centre of Exhibition of Legal Consequences.
Reports to the contributions to the books
The social works found in programmes such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for people may not be completed where recording serious delays from the lack of economic resources, Miguel Angel López Miranda reported.
The Director of Social Development stated that, even if the construction programmes have progressed, they are in a risk situation, because the Government of the State has not received its obligations to offer contributions exceeding 11 million weights in the three programmes.
It has reported that the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million weights, of which the State must provide 25 per cent, and until now only the Federation and the municipality have provided resources for works, so there is the possibility of a delay at their end.
"They must provide a contribution of 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything, even since July they have given us a part of it," he said, "and we, to not record delays, have started the works and we have made much advance, but we need money."
He mentioned that during the past year, during Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, thus at the beginning of the administration, the Municipe had to request a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided at that time.
"We had already done this during the previous sexual period because the State had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to work, and this year, to have access to these programmes, we have brought the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he described.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by the authorities of the State to provide these resources, he stated that they had made the request to the Administrative and Finance Secretary, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages reached as soon as possible.
"They must provide nearly 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything."
The Valid Court of Analogue Court in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analogue signals by digitals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has deployed the constitutional controverses that the Senate and the Chamber of Members have formulated against the presidential decree for the 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes needed to disqualify it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, namely the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed its commitments when he issued the decree that detailed action to follow in order to consolidate the transition to the digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been deployed to have not reached the qualified majority of eight votes in order to make the Court pronouncement of the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a regulation reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchy subordination and reserve of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Members promoted two constitutional conflicts to contest the decree and accepting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided by the Decree for digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also decided to deal with the complaint formulated by the House of Members without discussing the project of the Minister Sanchez Cordero also responsible.
In its intervention, the President said that he was not in agreement with the arguments of the project, in the meaning that the Federal Executive cannot structure the measures to prepare it through general standards.
"I do not also think that it would affect the autonomy of the Regulatory Agency," and he recalled that the planning of policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Ex-Agency, which has for the constitutional mandate of the State's direction.
The substitution of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the past years, and it is translated into a better operation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more chains.
Updating the change, it supported, would update the benefits of digitalization involved in a decision of public interest which does not only have a technical dimension, "for it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of all a established system, to the principle of the State's economic direction, includes a group of attributes granted by the Constitution to the responsibility of the State's Executive".
He reminded that a lot of countries of all have already completed the digital transition and have made it through the Exhibition, despite having strong technical organs.
It is not possible to conclude that the Executive, by issueing the contested decree, has a form of the field of competence of the Congrès, as it ensures in the administrative area the compliance with the laws issued by the Law.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to the data made by PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total terms.
The possibility of the " vote by vote" is a reality in the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where the data provided by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) are only 27 per cent, even without computing the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total verb processes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Mary of the Llanderal Angles Zaragoza, reminded that a few days ago, last 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of direct lines to harmonize local standards with the Federal Reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of State or His Electoral Justice Act, while the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the time to enable this electoral process to enter into force and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel ford its publication within the periods provided by the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nations (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the mandatary of the State for Constitutional Reforms, because he does not have the right to sanctify or contest them.
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", Mary de los Llanderal said that by the approval of the direct lines corresponding to the IEM General Council it would be possible to carry out partial and all the votes of the local electoral bodies.
Thus, the part of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be: the results of the verbs are not coincident; there are no verbs of audit and records in the orn document are not located by the President of this; or there are evidence errors or changes in the verb procedures.
Furthermore, the total account of the votes received in all the urnes of the election can be carried out when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate supposed to win the respective election and the second place in the investigation is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is a stated penalty of the representative of the Party and/or coalition that presented the second of the reported candidates.
The total account of the audit may also be achieved if at the end of the common account it results that the difference between the winner and the second place is equal or less than a percentage point, provided that there is a stated penalty of the representative of the political party whose second candidate has come out, where the electoral packages are excluded from the partial accounting.
It must be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where the PREP, the difference between the first and second place, is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting the votes of 129 of the 923 total verb procedures.

The new Italian Government will be formed Thursday
The named Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed this country at the border of the economic disaster.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Thursday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the border of the economic disaster and threatened the entire Eurozone.
A Chairman of the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet Thursday with the President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that he presents a cabinet in his majority of technocrates, even if it is not aware when the new ex-effective will have its post.
Monti said that he would present to the President the result of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tonne of its comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well traced," he said.
Monti completed the process for forming a government in less than three days, in a lower time than usually, while Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that has moved the cost of its debt at levels impossible to support.
The new administration governed by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard packet of abstention required by the European leaders to recover trust in Italy.
Highlighting the pressure on Monti to move, the instability of the markets to place the performance of the Italian BTP obligations to 10 years above 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronal Confindustria, said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to cause this emergency situation.
The possibilities of success in Monti have been emphasized by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, for which the crisis has been forced to release last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," said the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Centre-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because many of its members had yet been opposed to the Government of the Technocratic majority of Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably will be immortal reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian foreign forces added to the pressure, noting that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti began its consultations on Monday with political, syndicates and patronal groups and young and female organizations.
He'll finish his meetings on Thursday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, which has been able to have a very quick transition in response to the crisis.
After a short repeat at the end of the last week, when Berlusconi was denied, the costs of the Italian debt have now come to critical levels between the uncertainty of the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a debt of 1.9 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of the Eurozone.
Monti said that its Government should continue until the future elections planned for 2013, despite generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to apply reforms before the elections are being progressed.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the large parties insist on the fact that this must be formed only by specialists, a index of their objections before a process obliged by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that reciprocal failures and disagreements between parties are complicated by the trial of political figures.
The experience of Spanish is greater than that of the Coasts
Of 22 footballers called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convocated attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast with Costa Rica, compared with the 22 convocated by the two countries for today's friendship at 15:05 a.m. at the National Stade of San José.
The National Champions and Europe, the number one of the month classing of the FIFA, accounts for a number of class A interelectional games, the Tricolore only has defensor Michael Umana as the only one with the 50 international matches.
This number was reached on Friday past in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing in the Stars Ligue and in powerful Clubs of the Prime League of England keep an intense activity in ligue campionnates and national coups and disputes in European coups such as the Champions League.
To all these things, experience with Furia Espanola must be made during the complicated eliminators of the European Cope and the Football World.
In contrast, Catholic footballers have a limited international experience to a area, such as Concacaf, which is considered as a lower level in the FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is the guard of Iker Casillas, who previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) compared the record of the old guard of the Objective Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will put a new record for Spain of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, flying Barcelona brain, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even reconstituted in the previous week by EUFA by the other centers of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front center of the Schalke, Raul González, with 102.
Ready for the center number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andres Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the side of the coast, and near Michael Umana are the left side of Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and Bryan Ruiz butter, with 45.
After that, only five passed over the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
Those who have more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even 20.
Pens that Nano Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar only has one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not yet starting.
The historical butter of Spain is David Villa, with 50 mouches, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to collect two travellers
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real."
In the interview with Viva, the Jeff Ament bassist, of Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts on Saturday next on the National Stade.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group will ensure that it will be a real dream for them in this country.
It is that the bassist and funding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in South America's railway of its two workshot collection tour and Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day they will be presented on the National Stade, from 19:30 a.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extrait from the conversation, which is completely transcripted in the National Internet.
For its category adepts, the fact that Pearl Jam will occur in Costa Rica is a real dream. Do you know what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and this has been great.
I went to Costa Rica only once the vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to go over there for a few days.
So this makes us feel that we have our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live intensely in the past days.
What is your message for your most fervent adepts?
Thank you for staying near us all these years.
There were 21 years for us to go in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much, and we are sorry for the fact that so long it had to pass to this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the largest show of the year.
Is this a little pressure for your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we offered during the last 21 years have occurred in the last two weeks.
We offered two giant shows in Sao Paolo and hoped that this made us form for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very impatient to produce it.
We love this country, we love to make surf and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries of the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to make surf?
We have many surrounding friends and I have a very good friend living in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always going to make surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, near Mexico, are big places to make surf; so we learned it through the surfs that love the surf.
By seeing the tour, you offered great shows, with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never produced ourselves there, we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a large variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs of each album and offer our fans a good and different directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that supposed to be?
I think it is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everyone loves different songs, so it is very difficult to choose what songs to interpret each night.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have no longer interpreted for a long time, it helps us to remain disappointed and surprised because this reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we could have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you collect 20 years of travel.
Looking back, is it difficult to believe all that you have succeeded?
Yeah, absolutely.
First, I believe that no one of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock group, and that we did it for more than 20 years ago that it was a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the way that we can continue to do music in ○ we feel very much.
We love and love the creation of music.
We are happy to go to places in the world to which we have always wanted to go.
The things couldn't go better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been an element in the creation of the grong?
This has always been an honour to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friends with people in Sundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a move comes from a group of friends and is not common.
Sometimes a group comes from a city, but it's much more strange when five or ten groups go out at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them in time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their tour, so we are happy to be still friends with them and it is a honour to be part of this sound of Seattle that came up.
It's also very strange that a group as yours remains united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been in ≥ 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has met us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups normally.
First, I believe that we all are happy to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are music bullets that give freedom to each of us to experience.
We have confidence in each other with everyone's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word clebrity was not easy; however, thanks to your success, you could have done what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We assure us that we don't have too much time in turn because it's easy to fall in this game of big and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we need to respect music and what it has brought, without putting the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we have written good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We have been a group for almost three years and we haven't had a disk before Andrew Woods died.
There were many frustrations for the fact that she was so little and the most important is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who began in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he laughed, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising man and we missed him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and so you have chosen it to open it?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals, and that was the group we loved most, so we are impatient to see what Las Robertas could offer directly, and this must be very aware.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's words directly?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It's him who sing it and I think he does it with the first words he thinks.
As a bassist, what are its influences?
There's so much...
Among the first ones I remember there was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many influences that I can talk about the bassists all afternoon I love.
How has Pearl Jam succeeded to keep the grongen relevant despite the fact that this is no longer in the mode?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the grong word.
When I think of this, this reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have occurred at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think that this is wonderful, because it is a music that is worthless to listen and groups like Mudhoney now do the best music than ever.
At the beginning, her music had a more dark content and now it became more positive.
What does this change have to be done?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that are more low, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as very dark songs, even if these can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I wept when I heard them and these are deeply dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a traumatism in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and these songs, of course, represent it for me.
I also think we can be happy and even as we can do of dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle force he presented in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who purchases 25 years of prison for violations of human rights committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various affections, a language cancer for which it has been operated four times and under control.
The Congressist Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told for the TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of Neoplasic diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of force in its members.
Aguinaga commented that in its opinion, Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of penalty for humanitarian reasons, he certainly said that he would not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been operated four times of language cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kg, and other diseases, such as a severe erotic gastrite, a pancreas coast, renal calculations, hepatic hypertension and problems in the feet, mentioned the doctor.
Fujimori purchased the prison since September 2007 to the National Directorate of Special Operations of Police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for the death of 25 persons because of an annihilation scadrone of the army who had worked clandestinally during the first years of his government.
Musica travel to Mexico to consolidate political links
A official courtage, with the head of the Uruguay President, José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and patrons, will start on Monday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and to address the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her mexican approved Felipe Calderon, the highest point of a long meeting agenda with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collectivity of Uruguay residents in Mexico, the agenda distributed by the Uruguay Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in Guadalajara will be "appropriate for exchange of information in political matters between the two nations", the information provided by the Presidency of South America on its website.
According to local media, Mujica wants to convince Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France when the French mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax paradises in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In its speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries who continue to be tax paradises, a statement that caused Urugvay's rejecting and calling for consultations from his ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been presided since November the G20, a stronger and stronger group of countries in the world, and has in force with the South America country since January this year a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguay Government has tried in recent years to prevent the concretation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "green list" of the Organization of Cooperation and Economic Development (OCDE), integrated by countries which do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
Commercially, Mexico and Uruguay have entered into force since 2004 a Free Trade (TLS) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu floor passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struck, insufficiently, for 25 years to save the princess Peach from the attacks of the wicked Bowser, but he never had done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he would fight for the love of the youth in stereoscope.
The title, which comes this month to the stores of everyone, has been designed from the beginning to well exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows playing in three dimensions without use of lunches.
"Mario is the person who has to say how the stereoscope should work without lunettes," said Nintendo's specialized press responsibility in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "The first video game of Nintendo designed initially for this support", since until now successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adjustments of existing titles.
Nintendo's password supported that, despite being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a quick and liquid part.
Alvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simplify" to cross the less capable users.
Once above, the most experts will be able to make a "second tour" at game levels, which this time are more difficult.
Moreover, users will be able to choose at real time between a "agressive D" or one who only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and "not to be able to be able to be able to go up with optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also suggests the return of the person to a mobile console, which has not been passed since 2005.
In these video games, Nintendo looks at the saga adeptes and repeats the form of success of previous games, which consists of the fact that moustachu plumbing must park mined platforms to free the Princess Peach.
Even if I player find newnesses in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom gives its decline to the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Wednesday that he had ordered the former Governor Alfonso Portillo to answer the United States for the conspiracy for the whiteness of $70 million.
Thus, Guatemala shall be completed in order to respond to the request of the North country in which Portugal claimed to judge it.
In conference of press, Colom claimed that his decision was obedient to the independence of the judicial and ex-effective power, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered its extradition.
He acknowledged that during his mandate "He had not helped" in no Judge resolution and had given course to all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extracted for severe lesions, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Strada Paredes will be extracted for drug trafficking.
What Colom did suggest an executive approach after exhausting all legal and constitutional institutions to judge the former mandatary of the period 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Penal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portugal should be extracted after resolution of its legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteed human rights.
Portillo was approximated for department of Q120 million in the Defence Minister when he was president, which was the extraction process, but the Public Ministry called and reactivated the case.
Trinity has helped 6.000 young people in risk situation
The entity is born to avoid the marginalisation of youths without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijov social support entity is important: 6.000 youths with exclusion risk received aid to overcome a difficult situation during this fourth century.
This is the long center of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make the balance in a collected act in an ancient industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, who has assisted more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella quarter in 1986 with the aim of helping the few, without work, with toxicomanie or marginalised problems.
The collection of yesterday in Sant Andreu has made a large number of entities and institutions responsible for those 25 years.
The various political representation, at the full electoral season, showed the unity of the work carried out by Trinijove.
On the side of the President of the Regional Government Catalan (Generality), Artur Mas and his president Jordi Pujol, assisted the former Minister for Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the old maid assistant to the Major and current eco-socialist municipal adviser Ricard Goma.
We also attended in the large room of Fabra i Coats, the current Minister for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director-General of Charity of La Ca®, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current is it, but he said that the work done until now "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijov an example to know the fight against the bad circumstances and to give the hope of people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and the work that it does," he said.
property envahied by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders were suitable to 11 of the 13 apartments of the building in Balmes, 51
12 employees abandoned the property at midnight without any resistance
Everything indicates that the cauchemar has ended the residents of Rue Balmes 51.
Twelve people left volunteerly to midnight the immobility they were illegally occupied and where they organized micro-fests that would despair the neighbors, by judicial order and without the need of a police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door's lock was changed to avoid repeating the situation.
"From this day there will be a control of access," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had envahied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of them were inhabited -, took the electrical installation and part of the water, except painting the walls and left residues in there, especially alcoholic drink woods.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass festivals, which would last until two days and desperate the placeholders.
Near the building there is a discoteque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europe Press that since the employment of the building, her case was decreased by 80%.
The owner of the discetch stated that the invaders of the property did his deliver competence because they sold glasses to three euros, while in the disketch they were worth 10.
Moreover, the owner of the lodging site had to respond to the complaints of neighbors for the voice, while, this, the anxiety was not caused by the discetch clients, but by the occupied households, and especially by the participants in the festivals organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, and the neighbors of the area's irritations.
The responsibility of the discetch explained that the anxieties were so big that she even made an agreement with the owner of the illustration, and that makes nine months that this "forgives" law.
The Guarantee of Urbana ( municipal police) also confirmed that in the last weeks they had received more complaints from the neighbors for this situation.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, president of the municipal group of the Major's PP, had requested "the immediate evacuation of the immobile to end with the common and civil problems that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The people's leader explained that before the south, only a station of the building was busy, but in the last months the squatters had occupied all the areas of the building and almost all the apartments and that there were also flights in certain apartments.
It is in this sense that he has said that it must end with impunity and be implacable against the antisocial behaviour generated in the property."
Yesterday, Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in New Barris.
At 15.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral 35, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people had access to the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or Mount?
Coincidents on the opportunity of convocation besides the Polymetic on Honoraries
The municipal concurrence on the 16 ports opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 1980s, in full support of the already exhausted Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this printed Collserola promotion shows.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of the Metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it also contained a comparison, in digits, with the Central Park of New York.
With the CMB's death, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the highest limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that is not oriented on the north-south axis, elsewhere high (montage) - lower (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is the benefit of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with bloods in the role of the Yogi orchard.
This was the situation until, in September, the Major convocated a mega-competition composed of 16 concurrences for all doors of access to Collserola.
A door returns to the park idea, no doubt.
That's it, or somebody wants to put the doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The concurrence, both on its organization and on the town's thinking, is a theme of the discussion of all Barcelona teams.
It's almost a recurrent theme whose two members of this ancient elix castle speak when they are in an assessor.
And this is just one of the rare opinions on which three teachers of Barcelona, university teachers, were present.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the concurrence is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the literal front "the needs" to discuss on "the mountain front" because the Talk of Ildefons Cerda, the Green House's ships has not been finally conducted.
"We need to get out of the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the verdict gave the architect for which the title of "Coleserola ports" refers to a "lexical stage": you should not think of these "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which you need to act."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanist world, qualifies the proposal as "intelligent challenges" with "some dangers".
The dangers resulting from "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience v's experience in the '80s and had been in the Forum' song.
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which it can be built.
"Limiting something means to set the next step," that is, its oversight.
"We need to think of new urbanism instruments, planning, because current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause disaster authentics."
With the more question, Modol thinks that by simplifying the Valles de Collserola region's versant "can be heard as a park, which is Barcelona's, no."
The modele reminds that there is already a work made by the Collserola Patronat that "not need to be lost" by thanking for the opportunity that the Major offers his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first time".
Moreover, he hears that the neighborhood of the mountain with the city is the non-conduct that allows the teachers to enter into the debate, but "twice" if this technical profile has to guide the multidisciplinary teams ("all a successful", he says) that we have the creation of: "We, the teachers, should be only one instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this room is complex, because the bases of the concurrence miss a global vision of Collserola: "16 transversal concurrences have been convocated - he says - in the meaning of the mountain-sea, but there is no longer reading that sees and understands the area in its enemy."
This makes at least in this case that he has chosen to participate in the 16 concurrences.
Another way, a project so that one of the doors can shoot in the program and definition with the architect of the neighborhood gate.
In its opinion, yes, the lawyer should ensure that the band immediately exceeding that of the Ronda de Dalt should, in all its view, provide a deep transition between the city and the green area.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and this will be free
After 72 days of preliminary arrest, the foundation of Casino Red gave the forgiveness to the brother of the Master of Monterrey for the initiation against him for pre-cantages
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released in freedom after the foundation of Casino Red's power grants him the excuse before the Second Penal Court of the District, which follows a sentence against the Master Brother of Monterrey.
After the expectation of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, held a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás assumed to pay for a economic quota so that the Major of Monterrey allows the clandestin function of the game house.
After the denunciation, the Parquet opened a penalty against the Master PANist brother, and on 2 September he was arrested and maintained in a provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agency of the Public Ministry 3 of Patrimonial Delities, it was transferred to the Center of Detention 1, held in the Ancient Fourth of the Capital of the State.
It remained there for the next 49 days when a second detention order was stated after the Agency of the Ministry of Public Deliverance and Organizated Crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Criminal Center of Cadereyta presumedly because he had sing with a million and half weight owners of Casino Red; but he only spent a few hours in the Media Safety Center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the proceeding in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On October 25, an order of capture was issued by the Secretary of the Second Penal Court of District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation, there were sufficient evidence confirmed to determine the fault of Jonas, as regards the enhancement of 1.5 million weights of the representatives of the game house in exchange to allow its function.
On Monday, Victor Aldo García Gomez, the foundation of the Casino Red power, presented before Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the Master of the region, thus he could recover his freedom during the following hours.
Pengt; the formalities, the Agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been recovered and who of the game house's associates had been the one who had granted forgiveness, but the lawyer tried to refuse the name.
In accordance with the case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted forgiveness, and later no claim on the proceedings against it will be submitted; no repair of damage and any punishment will be requested.
After hearing the foundation of the game house's foundation, at 15:50 p.m., the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to forgive Jonas that he had been forgiven and was classified.
He will also make him the immediate order of freedom which the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome gives the details of the aircraft in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people lost his life
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) informed that the results shown on the a·, in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven others, indicate that the helicopter has shooked directly against the ground in full integrity, without the pilot to try a forced attraction.
Pengt; a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jacome, Secretary of Communications and Transports, mentioned that before the aviation collection, the pilot found that climate conditions were suitable to flight.
"The elements that indicate that the unit had different contacts with the ground, the balls had contacted the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuseling."
He also informed the fact that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it satisfied the requirements necessary for transporting the staff.
Furthermore, he said that research in the impact area does not refer to the appearance of parts in the ground.
"In a research, it was reported that there were no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact had been present in a manner.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and satisfied the requirements to transport them.
The ground had a flash of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary assured that a priority is to have the as soon as possible results; but the investigation may last a few months, even one year.
At his turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the time of the impact, the helicopter of the State of President worked rapidly to cross, and this happened on a growing ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal function crossing at the time of the impact," he says.
The press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jacome, mentioned six important elements in the investigation:
Full visual:
According to the aircraft legislation, the flight was carried out with the rules of visual flight, which includes that the team must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned appropriate conditions for collection, and the aircraft was going to the border area between DF and Mexico State, and there were low-height nebulosity beds.
Selected Rows:
It is said that because of nebulosity conditions, the team has searched for a lower and more visibility area towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the aircraft on the concomitant radar, probably before the impact, have not been lost or changed the flight traveller.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
Available information allows us to assume that the impact has occurred on a right and side trajectory.
The model for the spread of the aircraft residues allows the helicopter to be heated against the ground under the conditions of integrity.
No fire or explosion traces were detected:
There is always no trace in the rest of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the airport had multiple contacts with the ground.
The land travels found parts of the aircraft at a height of 9000 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground had a penetration of seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photographs show the sequence in which it may have disarticulated during his journey.
The information provides elements that indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple effects with the ground.
After a minute research in a larger area than the surrounded area, around the aircraft, no split parts were found, which supports the presumption that the impact had occurred under conditions of integrity.
MSS announces a protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social insurance guides an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and youths; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute (IMSS) announced that it was conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and youths, called the 'Genetical Protocol on the Obesity of Children and Youths', which will enable the markers associated with overweight.
In one case, the Chief of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochimia of the National Medical National Centre of the 20th Sect, Miguel ́z López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, farmers, nutritionists and social assistant was established.
This team is supported by experts and students of the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and the Centre of Investigation and Advanced Study (Cinvestav) of the National Politechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate in the population with or not right, to present the ISS Sport units participating in the Valle of Mexico, where the evidence of minors every Sunday at 8:00 a.m.
He highlighted that the protocol started in the Sportive Cuauhtémoc (Estato de Mexico Poniente) and that since 8 October, the activity was carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sport Unit (Estato de Mexico Orient).
After reaching the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independence Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (North of Federal Distrito).
It explained that the goal of this research and the e is to know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identifying risk factors among children and mexican youths in order to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Day of Diabetes will be collected on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal was to meet three thousand children and youths between six and 14 years, with their parents' supervision and monitoring, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their activity and their family heritage of their diseases to avoid risk factors that cause affections such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It detailed that Sabbaths will apply to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size, reference of size), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (this is seeked to identify people associated with infantile obesity).
López reported that this investigation is the fruit of health professional concern for the weight of weight in the case of minors.
"The health investigations of 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years ago, in the case of boys, there was a increase of 77 per cent in obesity and 47 per cent of girls; in the case of overview, a dramatic increase was also observed," stressed the IMSS specialist.
He pointed out that the justification for the research of the markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others in its genetic history.
He informed that the Mexicans in the meantime have a 65 per cent of Indonesian heritage, a 30 per cent of Europe and a five per cent of African, and that condition reflects in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the genetic obesity generally is translated into the incapacity of brushing the overall energy consumption (calories), which is replaced in the form of grass.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the integral evaluation of children, which allows to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of the darkest colors (acanthosis) on the neck and the front-bras indicates the probability of suspecting metabolic and even pre-diabetes.
The information is administred in a confidential way, doctors send it in writing to parents, to which each of the measures and changes in their lives must be explained to prevent diseases.
López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic affections: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily activity, remain the majority of the day sitting before the television and using transport means instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric advantage, which is the biggest consumption of sugar drinks, carbon hydrates (as - meat of meat to milk meat involved in meat fees -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asfalt would avoid cases
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, develop asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with a better performance, independent of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pave was resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 000 cases each rain season in the Metropolitan Valle of Mexico, Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher of the UNAM Chimie Faculty (FQ), which ensured that if the building and maintenance of the bitumenous pave is appropriate, cases could be reduced or even completely removed.
Pengt; its conference A view of cases, organized under the International Year of the Chemical Year, announced that the laboratory who is responsible for developing asphalts with polymers to produce a mix with similar characteristics of asfalt, but with a greater mechanical resistence, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera considered that this type of ashletes could be used in places where the climate is extremely heavy, as some cities from the north of the country, to improve the performance, and thus the training of cases.
He explained that the asfalt, the heavy part of the oil, is a mol of hydrocarbons, moles with a heavyer molecular weight, called asfalt, and moles with a low molecular weight, called Malthene, which gives to the pave his vicoelestic behaviour.
The viskoelastic behaviour of the asfalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees C its viskosis is very large and 50 degrees C it presents a closely strong state, while at very low temperatures, asfalt becomes falling, it is.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warning the chemical engineer specialist.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City in most of them were covered by a flexible pave composed of six material beds, which included asfalt.
Among the surface beds is the asfalt box, made by small stones in asphalt and compressed later.
Each of the small stones that form the bed, he signaled, is bathroomed in asfalt.
When vehicles make up efforts, it allows forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had asfalt, these would be better spread, thinking of the chemical engineer.
On the asfalt bed, he says, a latest beach called rolling bed, made in fine stone, that is, of the sand that is also thrown into asfalt.
As this is the box in contact with the vehicle wheels, it must have more mechanical power than the asfalt bed and provide accession in the street.
As part of the pave that receives and distributes the effort, the rolling bed also requires a suitable wave and the material it is made should be cared.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because these affect the performance of the asfalt bed.
When the ground goes up, water spreads inside the bed is difficult that this, which collapses all the beds of the pave and thus causes cases.
In the course of a case, he says, the first to be the rolling film and only later is affected by the asfalt bed, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be cared for the first signals with appropriate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National Research System explained that the carriage of vehicles is another important factor for cassing training and thus the depreciation of each pave bed must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction to avoid frequent case training.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asfalt, for example bitumenous emulsions, which already exist in other countries on the market and allows the cases to be repaired easily and without to use high temperatures.
What was missing the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not get the coron of Mrs. Colombia.
Valle receives its title number 14 of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the coron of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that he was on the podium of winners, carrying the money coron and the band that believed it as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result received last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the coron and the sceptre, the department already sums 14 titles of Princesse and Melina with one of the women from Valle del Cauca, who were found near the coron, but who were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), − Domingguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Ever (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garces Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garces Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question that many people ask is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defect of a great favorite that in each presentation she showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been chosen in vain to the Queen of the Police and Best Visage Jolie de Vogue, titles received by the Queens Talian Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the coron of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered the key in the decision taken by the jury to design her First Princess is that she did not convince her response to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? put by Martín Murillo Gómez, the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer of the Valle candidate to this question:
"I read much, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, I'm definitely thinking that the book that marked my child is "The Little Prince," it's a very deep book.
Now I read "Cryme and Penalty", it's a universal book that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirowski, a Russian, a very beautiful book named "The Great of Blood".
This answer was not aware of the term "culturalization" and secondly not to explain exactly how each of the books quoted it had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremonie Melina said she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it is happening what must happen.
And for everyone, please read, "The Little Prince" is a big book."
Among the hypotheses there is that Valle was destroyed by the favoritism.
A journalist of Bogota suggested that it was the preferred, ovationed and candidate who received all preliminary prices (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "he raised the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the Queen, and therefore she did not have the scene."
And this was noted in his first presentation on the beach of Hilton and his two sticks from the guard of the coronation.
Even if she had been sure of herself, it was noted that she had not the power and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como in house" (As home), of the NCN Channel said that Melina has been designed principle "confirms that the candidate who receives most prices during the concurrence does not receive the coron of the Queen".
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has not been able to convince the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Concurrence of Beauty.
That is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman involved in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the face and take care of its social importance, that before the Concurrence begins, they are already involved in projects," she explains.
It is also hoped that Valle has sinned by its deficiencies of his back and fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory, because the jury has chosen it as the candidate 'Natural property' with the healthier, good food and work responsible.
The Preparator of Queen Jorge Hernán Orozco recognized that Melina had not the best body, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which actually had not been too important for me, left her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyo, of the Cromos magazine, considers that the error of the Valle candidate was the surgical interventions she had taken.
"The surgery is good, but the Valle doesn't know to do it.
Her body has never been her own and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this price, that the National Concours of Beauty for the first time, after the bath-shopping, a cruel predict that was accomplished last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo did to Melina to not give him the go of the coron.
The truth is that Melina begins a year of government today, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives him the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international concurrences by designation of the National Concurrence.
However, she will pass through the story as one of the Queens who, despite her exciting passage by Cartagena, did not get the coron.
This was the work of the person in Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscope of Cali passed through the history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officers is essential.
Last 4 November, a dactyloscopeist of the CTI of Cali passed to the history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chef of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his digital prints.
Of the seven dactyloscopists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week was the "Availability" tour of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who worked for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to pass more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the body was identified.
In 2000 he was transferred to the Valle capital, and after having followed appropriate courses, he was specialised to dactyloscopie, which is the study of the fraction skin, namely the paums and foots.
The week of operation against Alfonso Cano we had warned Eliazar to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was taking it.
Friday night he went to Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodys and that it was suspected that one of them was the man who led the older guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the map with the ten digital prints of Guillermo León Sáenz (her true name).
But when he arrived with the team of investigation at the place of the body, he did not recognize it by its aspects, because this was very different from what he saw in the media.
He had no barbecue, he was dressed as a landscape in the area, without bullets and much more mad.
But prints don't lie.
Accompanyed by a Galtonian loup, an encre, a retailer and a lanter, Eliazar compared the digital prints of the body with the cards.
It was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man originating in Puerto Tejada was the responsibility that confirmed the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, as yes, was the Supreme Chef of Farc.
Searching for printing
For a dactyloscope of Sijjan de Cali, the president Juan Manuel Santos did to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people didn't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a precise science, without error margin, which may be crucial in the crime resolution.
Besides identifying the body, dactyloscopests support investigations for crimes such as flight and homosexual and confirm identity of captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their digital prints and search them in the database.
The researcher told that in a case of flight he had to remove a part of the wall from a house, for in that place the flighter had pressed his hand to make a full-fort coffre of boys and money.
"The walls are hard because they are not appropriate surfaces to take a digital print, but in this case we could → print the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in different flights," he remembers.
Prints may also separate or confirm suspicious in cases of homicide.
Recently, a dead man was found with drink bottles around him.
Through the investigation, a parent may be suspicious of the crime and, in fact, a print on the bottom coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the one, it is the place on the scene of crime.
A dactyloscope of the CTI explained that "the digital printing of the objects with chemical or chemical reactions".
When they appear, a retailer or band is used to remove them.
Later, prints are sent to Asif, the declinant database, or the Civil National Register.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without paper," indicates the CTI expert.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI TV programme.
As everything is not gold, everything we touch is not forcely a print.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is made.
"Indignes" defend the authorities in New York
Hundreds of manifestants were walking before the Zuccotti place to camp there.
Many people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a neighbor park.
The integrants of the Ocupe Wall Street movement challenged this Tuesday by the New York authorities trying to enter again, using a Judicial order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated to the coast and when they tried to take a different park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of manifestants were moved before the Zuccotti place, where they wanted to access through a Judicial order that allows the "indigne" to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupating a park more north of the city, where there were new detentions.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the place, we'll go into another place and we'll continue the fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sites and peaceful manifestations," said one of the words of the "Occupe Wall Street", Mark Bray movement.
Bray reported that the answer of the "indignes" to the evacuation of their camp, personally dictated by the Major of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed demonstrators to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the "indignes" occupied a new park with the confluence of the Canal Street Centrals and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which united New York and New Jersey, property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for a hour they succeeded to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and stopped some manifestants, even though Bray could not confirm the specific number, assured Ephe because he saw a few journalists to whom we had also passed mynths.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people have been installed in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders was moved to a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of the police.
Meanwhile, the place Zuccotti - which is a private property center - remains closed in waiting for the collection of a judicial audience scheduled by this Tuesday during which the evacuation of this morning is to be analysed.
Some manifestants moved up to that hour and distributed copies of this Judicial order and even delivered it to the supervisory officers, which caused 'certain small matters', said Bray, who said that some officials had struck the manifestants.
The Judicial Order prohibits the authorities to evacuate the members of the Occupe Wall Street or to apply laws after the beginning of the employment or to prohibit demonstrants to return to the park with tents or other properties they used before.
Major Bloomberg said before the press that because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and manifestants, however he warned that local laws did not allow them to install with tents and sacs to sleep.
The municipal adviser personally defended the evacuation carried out in the place of Zuccotti, a operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the manifestants were "violing the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people were not going to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to do bad to others", because "certain magazines had been threatened" and the residents were afraid "for their life quality".
"The evacuation of this morning at the spring was reproaching and showing that Bloomberg's fund is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of the American workers," says the mouth password, which is the major of "not respecting the freedom of expression".
The responsibility for the "Occup Wall Street" also indicated that they do not think to organize "great actions" for Thursday in relation to Community organizations and syndicates to remember the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virge Marie in a special television programme of Noel
Along with Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will go out in the television program "It's a Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", secretist in "Baywatch", lapin in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actor and model will be the Virge Marie in a special program of Canadian TV Noel.
The CTV private television channel has announced today that Anderson, on the side of "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will come out in the television program "It's a Peters Christmas" next 1 December, interpreting a very special Vierge Marie.
CTV has now distributed pictures of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive distribution on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the battler of "Möttley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared clothed as the Virge Marie, supporting in a cryce a poppe that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently presented a part of the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appeared as Joseph.
Near Anderson and Peters, the special CTV Noel's program also presents the Canadian song Bublé, who at the end of March march married in Buenos Aires the argentin model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not far away from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian 'pute' during one of its concerts in New York.
Japan renewed after land trembling
The PIB increased by 1.5% by domestic consumption and ended with the low spectacular from the beginning of March
Since March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, yet convaincing after the devastating devastater that became nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Nippons country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government calculated the material losses of $30,000 million, which, despite the difficult world context, has been decreased.
After three quarters of conscious fall, the data of the Internal Product Brut between July and September used to turn the page permanently: the BDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% annually.
This recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the largest rise of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the land tremblement and the tsunami afterward.
In fact, enterprises increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of the accounting costs observed from January to March, the first time after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the actual stimulant of the Japanese economy is not based on the Chinese impulsion that invites to benefit from the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use insufficiency for zero cross.
Japan was especially awakened by the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese BDP.
This variable increased a 1%, increased by the expenditure on vehicles, travels and entertainment activities.
The yen stump
Tokyo entered into the internal market when yen - nippone currency - has become one of the "requirement values" chosen by investors who flee the debt crisis in the euro zone and the predicted troubles of the United States, a privilege that has been borrowed as a debt in the accounts of export companies.
With a stronger division, the products are more dear in the foreign, a serious return for a country with the health of the large groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low results between July and September the quotation of yen.
Pensing that markets continue their seats in the EU periferic countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not decrease the guard.
"The risks must be followed, such as the detection of certain foreign economys, the impact of Thailand's inundations and the rapid appreciation of yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And actually, the perspectives are not absolutely encouraging.
The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OCDE) mentioned that most Member States had presented more economic relaxation signals in September.
The leader of the world economy's inspection points has emphasized that the main powers are released.
Because this has decreased four decimal points up to 100,4 points, compared to 100,8 out.
The Eurozone has even been below the average, which is located at level 100, not decreasing eight decimal points to 99.13 points.
Feeding Athens Again Twice
Papadimos says that adjustments will be approved, but the conservator will not sign any written commitment
With the uncertainty reinstalled in parks, Greece continues to meet in the labyrinth that leads to the outcome of the great crisis of European debt.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenian transitional Government is rather imposed by Brussels' requirements and by a real conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
The new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, reported yesterday that there was no alternative for reforms and that the hundred-day period established in his designation could be short to apply them, the leader of the New Democracy Conservative Party, Antonis Samaras, would not be able to support the new emergency measures in any case and repeated its need for new elections for the date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the sum of 26 October," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a trust vote for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officers and new measures against tax eradication will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not doubt about his position: "We are committed to help the Government of transition, but we have not been committed to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step far away in its powder than EU and FMI, the agencies that have to debloque the 8.000 million athenes needed urgently, and said that he would not approve any letter of the implementation of the adjustments.
However, the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the whole of the Papandreu referendum, repeated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not discontinue the aid if the new Government and leaders of the main Hellenian parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambition as soon as possible".
The Portal of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very fast" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranch" of 8.000 million, even if there is no final date.
The Greeks still have much to do.
Queen Sophia: "This are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "president" place of Spain in relation to this type of funding
Spain " has reached a world-based place in the role of Microfinances".
The Queen Sophia recalled that the country has become the second provider of the planet in the last two decades in relation to this instrument of cooperation which "the essence" resides in the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on confidence in human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V-e World Summary of the Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that there is no doubt that this type of operations are " absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very specially, in the one who has aimed to reduce half the volume of people who live with revenue under a dollar per day, which is fixed the "poverty severe".
Spain "continues to work" to enhance the network of benefiters "in all corners of the planet, and to ensure this task with "responsibility", reported Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions of origin during the Sommet, which will be extended until Thursday, "will guarantee the creation of new capacity and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main benefits of these loans.
We "reached a lot of goals" and "we face many challenges".
The summit of the Microcredit is considered not only as a forum of debate but also as the platform from which "two basic objectives" must be impulsed.
Thus, the objective is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that hundred million of these families are out of the poverty in which they live now.
The impulsion in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the road of the beginning a few years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus highlighted the Queen Sophia as a "righteous and due act".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "wonderful idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work of which she knew since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know its loans policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summe in Washington and other meetings such as those collected at the Ivoire Court in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "Every meeting I could find a continuous development", explained Saebeste, whose relationship with this project brought him the qualitative "Family Chief" gathered to Valladolid from the "Poor Banker".
Finally, the Queen of Sophia has completed its intervention by encourageing the people present to participate in the debate and search for solutions to progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for External Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this regard, she expressed that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to economic prosperity times, because it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez believed that micro-credits have a "serious and strict policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty" and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be the victim of compression.
For Spain, the micro-credit is one of the main lines for development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, approved "the success" to give "the trust" to those "excluding all who close the door"; and the Master of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, wanted to be welcomed to those present in a city who "opened its confusioned doors of the solid spirit".
The CDU proposes to eliminate the European President to the universal suspect
On Monday 14 November, Leipzig, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, the Chancial, but also President of the Democratic Christian Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned in the programme, but it was committed to the future, especially to satisfy the soldiers who judge the government's policy too laxist against the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was almost uniform.
Of 1001 delegates only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation for several minutes, on the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel, then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister for Finance, did not have any doubt.
The main idea of the Channelary - and the movement - is in a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less than Europe but more than Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "new million jobs depart directly from the euro".
For the chancelary, "the time came from a perceiving in Europe".
This could be translated by amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, but it could also take place on the election of the President of the European Commission at the universal suspect "to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the invitation adopted by the congress whose inspiration is Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is little that the 20th-Seven agree quickly on this revolution: Great-Bretagne is hostile there and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the yellow is placed.
Similarly, the delegates rejected a great majority of the proposal to put the weight of each country to the Directorate of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of each economy, which obviously strengthened the weight of Germany.
Sorry of the climate inside her party, the chancelary multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not even try to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the movement on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of "the French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not refer to France.
Except in cream.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defects of the Napoleon army.
What is the fraud of disease stops?
Following allocations, the OMP and the Government launch the opportunity on illness arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allocations, and to proclaim a talk on the subject - recurring since 2007 - the fight against social frauds and the assistant.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a will to make economy in a rigorous context, but is not less announcing one axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority want to deal with sickness stops.
The Government intends to impose the private salaries a fourth day of deficiency before taking a work stop.
Without a specific company agreement, a salary that falls sick would lose four days of salary, thus at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure that could rise from anger, but that would allow 280 million euros to report, Les Echos.
And who would be accompanied with another measure, more symbolic: impose to the officers a day of unrecompensed distortion in case of stop of work (they do not have even a time of delay, against three days in the private).
While these issues are discussed, the majority also repeat the thematics of frauds, aiming this time on abuses related to work detentions.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will rebuild," Xavier Bertrand warned at the RTL micro on Sunday 13 November.
As for other cases, the advertising effects are a little disproportionate with the reality of frauds to work stops.
This has actually been the subject of a constant and prosperous political monitoring since 2002, which have most often brought their fruits.
The French are not sicker than in Europe else.
Let's wait for the national numbers.
According to the National Sickness Insurance Case (CNAM), more than 237 million euros were issued in 2006.
According to the Health Economy Research and Documentation Institute, daily payments represented 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with EUR 11.3 billion.
In this sum, 46% covered maternity and work accidents, and 54% covered disease stops, or 6,2 billion euros.
So 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French knew at average 14.5 days of work stop against 17.8 in 2009, a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
One average that hides some divorces: another investigation, held in 2007 by the Monster.com carrier management site, shows that 75% of the 40 000 questioned French salaries said that they had not taken any day of illness.
Another study, this time in the Sickness Insurance , states that in 2010 37% of the disease stops were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% outside.
When they are compared to their European neighbors, the French salaries are not more attractive than to work stops.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that, between 1994 and 2001, the global absent rate (for health reasons or not) was between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud to the disease stops is very small in the face of the work at black.
As regards fraud, it only reaches a low widespread.
Increasing legislation since 2002, controls are systematic on sickness stops more than 45 days.
In 2008, on 1.5 million controls, the CNAM observed that 13% of the 285 000 for short-term detentions were "injustified or too long", or 37.050 cases.
In more than 45 days, systematicly controlled, 11% of cases were "inadaptated or injustified" of 1.2 million, or 132.000.
In total, therefore, 169 000 "injustified" cases on millions of salaries who have been ill.
A number that represents very little face, for example, the worker in black.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of lack of tax per year, or more than the total cost of daily compensations, and therefore more than the fraud to those last.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to reduce its economy.
That was what the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said before Parliament on Monday 14 November, that the hundred days given to his union government would not suffice to carry out this task.
"To continue the effort to resurrect the economy, we need support for our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Government's leader, who spoke his first public talk on the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Monday Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summary of the euro area on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, since the participation of the country in the euro area "is in play", he said.
Hence, Mr. Papademos planned that the country's public deficit would be decreased by "approximately 9%" of the BDP at the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right of the new outstanding measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, gave its support to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not engage in an additional abstention.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of its party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and fighting deficit but hostile policies that would prevent economic recovery.
The European Commissioner on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the FMI and the EU would not disbloke the loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties that they would support the measures provided, said Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign outside pressure.
An expert committee says that it is necessary to adjust euthanase and suicide assistance.
Canadians live in the deadly of death, the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health care institutions and doctors work to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the dead.
Only 9% of the Canadians accept to talk to their doctor about the conditions they want and take provisions for this purpose.
It is one of the conclusions of a reporting of the Royal Society of Canada, which has participated in six experts associated with different areas, including ethical, law and medical.
This committee recommends the Government of the Code in order to enable the assisted suicide and euthanase, when the choice is required, with a patient who considers that he is competent to make such a decision.
Income, experts cite a recent investigation of the United Intelligence Economy, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada classified 10th, the study notes that "the medicine of death in Canada has caused a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicinalisation or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to pallative care, reporting the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire most of the Canadians to go home, 68.6% of them end at the hospital.
In the end, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the dead in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of the assisted euthanase and suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions against the position of the Federal Government, which has already said that nothing would want to change the Code of Euthanasia and the assisted suicide.
However, experts, who have also been revised in all countries where these approaches are analysed or dealed, have no evidence that this dealing leads to abuse in the application, namely the practice of euthanism or suicide assisted on non-compliant or non-compliant persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, said yesterday in telecommunication, would have been found more cases of these disturbments precisely in countries where the assisted euthanase and suicide were not analysed.
"Euthanase is practiced in Canada, where it is illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians favorable to Euthanasia
Remember that 85% of the Canadians have already spoken for Euthanasia because they believe that it would allow people at the end of their lives to deal with their suffrances, a Reid investigation carried out in 2010.
And 66% believe that it will not result in sending the message that the life of older or handicaped people is less valuable.
As regards those who have practiced aid suicide, investigations consider 41% that they should not be continued.
As regards maintenance or suspension of care in a patient, the situation is less sensitive, says the reporter.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Code of the Code that it takes care of which a validly validity is not valid.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect a lifetime care, without fear of persecution.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health care institutions and doctors work to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in the field of pallative or terminal seat, already largely used in the Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it does not use to reduce the pain, as euthanase, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already issued reservations on the conclusions of the report of the Royal Society Experts of Canada.
Me Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, qualified for "extreme" the position of the report signing experts, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanase to sick in terminal phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be fatigued of life and who had more than 18 years could ask for help to self-suicide," Me Deschamps said, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
My Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report have placed the person's autonomy above all other values participating in the social weight of the society.
"In society, he says, there are labels and restrictions."
Margaret Somerville has also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which it has qualified for "pro-euthanase demonstration".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly responsible for the report on abuse in some countries where the helped euthanase and suicide are analysed, either in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad to leave the power
Specifies a "complot"
It is more isolated
Participants of Bachar al-Assad have shown yesterday before the locals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on Bachar al-Assad, which, with Russia's support, resisted them and declared a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of the Arab Ligue, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against it while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of the Arab Ligue, took position for a department of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader who called President Bachar al-Assad to "shoot the power" in the day where a 40% of civilians and members of the forces of the regime were still killed.
"If Bachar had a heartfelt interest in his country, he should leave, but he should also create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, neighboring country, in a BBC interview.
For its part, the leader of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu deceived that Turkish mediation efforts have been made from the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime have failed.
"They who are not in peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, "who are not in peace with the Middle East, making a statement to the neighborhood to which Turkey adopts a more difficult line.
The United States welcomed the "enhancement of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab Ligue and of the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Ligue, countries like Turkey are adopting a more hard tone" against repression, Mark Toner, a portfolio of the State Department.
At that time, 16 citizens and at least 19 members of the regime's forces were lost in Deraa, south of the region, announced the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other citizens have lost "times of shopping and pilonship to the heavy mitrailous in Jobar" in the placed town of Homs, this NGO.
However, during a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem considered that the country was "going to the end of the crisis".
Moreover, he reacted vitally to the decision of the Arab Ligue to suspend its travels, which constitutes him "a dangerous step".
The "nothing will flee", he said, "assuring that the complots of hurdis against the eye will fail."
After its decision to suspend the liague, the Arab Ligue now studies a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab rights of person, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also said favorable to send United Nations observators to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which is closed in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the Ligue is scheduled in Rabat tomorrow to take the point on the implementation of the crisis output plan on 2 November and, in particular, predicting the recovery of the armed forces of the cities in favour of the contest and release of the arrested manifestants.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergueï Lavrov, judged yesterday the decision of the Arab Ligue, while China urged the Commission to implement the crisis output plan, keeping on supporting possible sanctions against.
Italy
Monti requests time for markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future leader of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, requested a little time for the markets to form its team and implement a programme that will contain "offers" to recover the lost creditability in the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner was discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting the syndicates and the patronate today.
It should establish a relatively limited cabinet composed of external technocrates in Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of an important programme with many sacrifices," Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small Parliamentary groups engaged in the interviews after meeting the President of the appointed Council.
The President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, for its part said to expect Mario Monti to ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament on Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will be completed by Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list of 12 ministers to the head of the State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of yesterday and obligatory markets, asking them about time.
In "democracy, there are precise terms" to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying, "certainly, the markets will be patient and will understand."
Its designation by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern was once again, in particular, after an unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Deputy Prime Minister should be a team, particularly of technocrates, even if he stressed that he would like to include "politicals".
The new government must dure until 2013, on the date of the next islatives, considered.
According to the President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive the trust of the Parliament on Friday.
Mr Monti committed, once he entered into force, to work in the emergency and aim that Italy "revend protagonist" in Europe.
A port-order of the European Commissioner O日 Rehn stressed that "and with a new government, our Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome would not reach its budgetary balance goal in 2013 despite the outstanding plans adopted in the past months, requested, in particular, new rigorous measures.
The Italian "patron pattern" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restore the economy, "for a country that does not have growth cannot respect the deficit parameters."
Mr. Monti, considered for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" which symbolizes "the challenge of serious" and "the other Italian", the editors.
The big unknown will be the long-term of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid previous elections, since Italy has to place from April 2012 for 200 billion euros of State obligations.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a useful detonator with a nuclear weapon, said a American NGO specialised in the atomic risk on Monday.
The International Science and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (AIEA) and other documents from this UN Agency to identify this researcher.
The AIEA was part of its "serious concerns" last week on the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, a broad power in AIEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades since the 60s in a Soviet nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamants by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iran Ambassador in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA states that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system was "aided by a foreign expert who was not only aware of this technology but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during its career's essence in the military nuclear programme of its country of origin."
Anti-musulman crimes and crimes increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes against the Muslims increased from nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violences have severely low or lowly progressed, the FBI's statistics made on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violences perpetuated against the Muslims passed from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49 per cent of violence against Catholic progress, 4 per cent of crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased highly to 6 628 cases, including 47.3% motivated by race differences and 20% by religion differences, the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disappointed to see these crimes and crimes again," stressed the Human Rights Organization First, "the anti-musulman violence is particularly significant," the organization said in an appealed.
"Human Rights First has long highlighted that violence against the Muslims, as well as all forms of crimes, must be considered as a serious violation of human rights," says one of the responsibles of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"American Government can and must make more to attack these abuse," he recalls that this could be a better way for police reports on "hate crimes".
"The crime of hatred" in the American federal law is an inheritance of the time of fighting for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, the color of skin, religion, origin, and now sexual pertinence.
Twitter changes its platform and nothing more on Facebook
The microbloging Twitter site introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday, in particular to allow its users to observe the activities of those they follow, which makes his service a little more than Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" allows you to follow more readable, directly, the activities of the other "Twittos", the internates who follow messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have preferred messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percent of users in a aula" before it was spread to the Monday network, the AFP indicated the Twitter password, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known for his little instinct function, with some extreme terms (RT to repeat a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) which makes the happiness of the initiatives, thus opens to a wideer public with a more comparable management of the Facebook and Google+ large public networks.
On the network, users immediately discussed "tweets" on the interest of this innovation.
"It's unusual, invasive, and it's too in Facebook," wrote @jimb123.
"The Activity Functionality will help me better follow some of my Twitter flux elements," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
inscription of a "good rule" budget in the constitution
The Government of Great Social-Democrate/Christian Democratic Coalition to the power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a " gold" rule in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by the sovereign notation agencies of Austria (trip A).
It is the social-democracy Channel Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the outcome of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian debt is 74.6%, widely above the maximum of 60% fixed by the Maastricht Treaty, but just below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was only decreased from one crown, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros for more than each year," said the cancelling and Christian Democratic Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria therefore requests the summary in Brussels of the Member States of the euro area of 26 October: the State and Government leaders then claimed to encrypt this end of 2012 the reduction of public deficits and return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government approaches the "German Model", Germany who was the first European country to adopt such "regulation".
Since 2017, the structural public deficit must be reduced by 0.75% of the brutal internal product (PIB) each year and, since 2017, the structural public deficit of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35% of the PIB, while the regional States and the communes should provide balance budgets.
The goal is to make the debt at the horizon 2020/21 under the 60% criteria laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen strong
Noda threatening a new intervention on the change market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that nippons authorities would intervene again on the market of changes if they had to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we have done the last time if we find a volatility" in the yen change rate, Mr. Noda explained at Senat.
On March, Yen was not far from historical levels that moved Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold yens massively against dollars to reduce the value of nippone devise that just established a new record of force since 1945 face to the green ticket.
But the yen has been regularly raised from the purchases of investors that view it as a "value of refuge" in these uncertain world economic relaxation and detractive crisis in Europe.
The dollar is exceeded on Wednesday under the 77 yens and the euro descended under the symbolic bar of 105 yens, near the levels of the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yens and over 160 yens euros.
This flaming of nippone devise night to the export of the archive because it reduces the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the income from the foreign of the Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan fights to rebuild" since the session and tsunami of 11 March, who destroyed the region of Tohoku (north-East), Mr. Noda stressed that the yen retreat is not killed in the egg.
The third world economic power renewed the growth to the third quarter -1.5% compared to the trimester - for the first time in one year, by rebuilding the export and consumption of disasters.
But the Prime Minister felt that yen's care was not "the Japan's economics".
The Minister for Finance, Jun Azumi, has for its part called the Japanese Bank (BoJ), who opened a two-day meeting of his Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weak yen.
However, the assistant Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", allowing to hear that no additional monetary surprise was to wait on Thursday.
At its last end of October, the Emission Institute increased 5.000 billion yens (47 billion euros) purchases of the Treasury's goods, making up to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) the amount of the amounts she dedicated to the different financial funding purchases to the liquidity market.
Euro area:
grim rate, flashing rate
The risk of counterparty of the debt crisis is always the European indicators.
Despite the nomination of new Government leaders in Greece and Italy and the best growth numbers in France and Germany, the rate of fragilized countries continues to rise.
The European Bourses are still worried about the stability of the euro area, and the European Bourses are a little more in the negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10:00 CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Francfort is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
" With the new pressures on the performance of the euro area loans in difficulty, the worldwide action markets continue to become part of their recent profits. "
"The investors, nervous, are only too conscious of the risk of counterparty," explains Terry Pratt, institutional courtier at the IG Markets, quoted by the Re·s Agency.
The Tokyo Bourse has been locked down by 0.7%, suffering from the renewed fears of the market intervenants on the capacity of Europe to maintain the debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has the eyes on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a heavy currency until investors have no evidence that the situation is stabilised," Mitsushige Akino, managing funds in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resource of concerns on the future of the euro area penalises the unique currency, which continues to be low on Tuesday.
The euro has developed at its lowest level for a month and a half.
About 10 hours, the European department is 1.3570 dollars, a total of 0.4%.
According to the courtiers, she recovered after the party of the Channel Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in Monday Congress, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, the opportunity for a country in difficulty to get out of the euro area without taking the EU.
The Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Italy and Spain's rental rates remain at very anxious levels.
This Tuesday morning, the performance of the 10-year Italian obligations reaches 6.85%, the same Spanish titles of 6.2% maturity.
These pressures on the interest rates of Southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of the interventors.
The leader of the future Italian Government Mario Monti requested time to market the situation in Italy, threatened by asphyxie by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos claimed that the implementation of decisions taken at the summit of the euro area on 27 October would be the " main task " of his government.
Spain is located in the market mirror line, while on Sunday isslative elections in the country.
The rate art ("spread") between the 10-year-old obligations of Germany and Spain reached a new higher history.
In the expectation of euro area growth numbers
As a statistical cost, France has produced an economic growth of 0.4% to the third quarter, or a little better than 0.3% expected by the consumption of households.
The Insee, however, reviewed the number of the second quarter, with a recycling of 0.1% of the brutal internal product (PIB) instead of a stagnation.
And, actually, it's the fourth who's worried about the economy.
Germany, on its part, has produced a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
A first estimation for the euro area is expected at 11 a.m. while the European Commission has just watched the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must take it on the dogmes
If it is a subject that we can not be treated from short-term considerations or under the consequence of emotion, it is the energy policy.
Electricity's ability and costs are directly influenced on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that a electoral appointment is the opportunity to think about such injuries and the place that the nuclear holds there.
The debate will only benefit if it explodes the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, racial data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, the demographic development will lead to a double demand for election from 2050, unless a large part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, the refreshment of fossil resources will be needed to continue to produce "electivity permanently, without forgetting the imperorous need to reduce gas emissions of effect to combat climate disorders, a disappeared subject from the hedological debate.
Fukushima has not changed any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to reject the nuclear.
It is not the case of the bahic, which submits its need to find a source of replacement capable of replacers, or of Switzerland, which only hears to build centrals of the last generation.
In contrast, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to cite only them, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to hold a unit at their park by repairing the construction of a central that was interrupted after the Trie Mile Island.
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is contrary to speaking.
The Berlin election will be translated by the recovery of the electricity price, an increased energy dependence by the accru gas recovery imported, in particular from Russia, a lot of CO2 emissions resulting in the construction of gas and carbon centers.
In a few months, the incidence of these harmful effects has already been felt.
The case of Denmark is to meditate.
Europe's campaign of Eolian, which is 30% of its election, is also one of the biggest carbon and gas users of the wind's emission; its CO2 emissions and the price of its election are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
In contrast, through the constantness of our energy policy, our neighbors receive a higher choice factor than 40% of the French families.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a deal of the maintenance of the industrial tools in the national territory, the French companies are beneficial of the most dear Europe's election.
In this fact, any significant reduction in the nuclear part would lead to a strong increase in the election price, which would make the beautiful statements on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of Frances are to pay, as they do not demonstrate a principle of opposition to this energy, the investigations show it.
Remember that our country's energy policy has enabled the building of an industrial branch of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 employment induced.
It is strongly exporting, leading to a specialized SME galaxie on international markets and makes them very creaters of unlocal employment.
If France had decided to get out of the nuclear, many of these SMEs would be sacrificed by reducing as a damage skin to 6 billion euros annually of French nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would command a EPR designed to work for sixty years when its manufacturer's decline would be planned?
In order to solve the energy equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no source of the production of miraculous electority, not more than diabetes.
The development by Areva of low-emetrical solutions of CO2, renewable and nuclear solutions shows the complementarity of energy sources.
For the nuclear, maintaining the highest safety level is an absolute impairment.
We have a Security Authority in France who exercises an intransparency and transparent control on existing centres as on the Flamanville Chantier.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, are residents of the same security.
In a half age, the nuclear industry knew three serious accidents.
One, Trie Mile Island, has been intervened in normal exploitation conditions; it has remained unconsequently hum and environmental.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reaction and unforgiving human errors caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some have forgotten that it has resulted from two natural disasters of an unexpected widespread that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will treat the teachings of this accident, as it had done for the two.
The fruit of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, the operators and the French and German producers, the EPR provides a design that makes it possible to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all elections wishing to build a central, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the concurrents of Areva and EDF by allowing them the free way to deal with leadership in the incontournable development of the nuclear.
It is essential and important to seek the best energy bucket for our country, but it would be unresponsibility to allow the emotion, dogmes and partnerships to dominate a debat also determining for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles - incorruptible police, judges and administrative services under the number policy, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "Man Rights" of France.
Recently, this is the administrative archaeling of foreign students who have been currently made, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) who declare that France "not needs foreign talents, macements and restaurant servers".
However, it is only rarely analysed under the economic angle.
It is that there is a pretty wide consensus between left and right on this subject.
On the right hand, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who said in 1976 that "900000 unemploymenters should not be a problem in a country that includes nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and at the left, by Michael Rocard explaining that France "not can accept the whole world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by Poland plombing horses was shared on the left and on the right.
For both borders, immigrants are considered a burden for the economic and French society.
The only distinction is the degree of generosity that is to be granted to immigrants.
In its programme, François Holland sing to banalities, indicating that co-development will allow us to solve our "problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electronically paying; but it is economically very costly.
As the economys Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent work that synthesizes the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shape Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton & Press, 352 pages), there is a wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the flows on economic growth, salaries and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Return the immigration to the growth and night to the employment.
The fears regarding the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they can substitute themselves to national workers, especially the few-qualified, with a low pressure on their salaries.
However, the experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than substituted by national salaries, which exercise for the importance of employees in employment sectors.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not affect national salaries, and most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow job offers.
A positive effect on salaries
Similarly, as a chirurgian will have difficulty to work in a country that knows anesthetics penalty, these supplementaries between national and migrant make immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and the employment of the nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of the flows resulted in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of the long-term real salaries.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrations are also net contributors of social systems, a average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Working Organization considers that, in Germany, a 30-year-old immigrant will contribute to the average public budgets on its life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, to search for the growth points "with the teeth".
The tents concerned, in order to disobey immigrants, have had the exact inverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, still thinking of the European Democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has known the tragedies of the Great War, total spheres, Holocaust, goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, Colonels in Greece.
Some believed that it would provide, so that the democracy would triumph permanently from its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon, "The Little", that he was there with an easy thought.
The universal suffocation, to be the condition necessary for democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even be "oppression instrument" as the Republican Ethienne Vacherot philosophy said earlier.
No, democracy renews much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, a organization, a separate and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live is a economic crisis, but it is a crisis of political and democracy.
The palinodia of the true Greek referencendum will have a double revelation value in this regard: the need for a powerful return of the political, but also the feeling of its impossibleity, its incongruence.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overlooked.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic Battle have been moved today, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to require a succession of national references organized in terms of needs and spread orders.
A white-seing at the absolute European monarch or a joined foot-spot in the empty nationalist repli: what choice for the citizen!
No, we don't want covereds but a common exercise, full of right, serin and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would no longer know where to stop the enumeration - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole Europe who is involved in the dictates of markets and notation agencies, which deduces its impugnation and the lack of solidarity.
This is the whole Europe that is humbled on the international scene.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but this is the whole Europe who loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The emergency is to return to the people's sovereignty the piloting of the European project.
Because it is, the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free from markets and prepare the future by investing.
The outcome of crisis will assume decisions at European level that will not be taken without a total democratic potential, unless we are of course leading to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal of socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone calls for the European Economic Government today.
Soat.
But thinking of it without a stronger political and democracy integration, and v ́s like this by the citizens, would be a new foolishness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in the European construction.
In order to make the Republic in France, the Republic had to "fair" the Republic.
Revolution in interests could not exist.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe at the economic level.
This will only be possible by building a more democratic Europe on political level, a real European population sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's do the Europeans.
The "uncontact" cards are generalized
The World Card Room opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in a optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should actually end up with an increase of 11% of the world-wide microcards (cart, phone with SIM card...), more than 6 billion units, the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most poor segment is the of the uncontact that allows to pay the transports in common or to fix its purchases by simply approaching the map of a player.
This year, 460 million without contact cards should be sold throughout the world, against 320 million a year ago!
Their part should continue to progress in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market in the puzzle card (6.925 million cards).
Longtime at the train of Asia-Pacific region, Europe wins land for payment without contact.
Approximately 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the starts are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double bottles.
Carefour has thus issued this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To go to the higher speed, banks need to equip their clients now.
"The two large French institutions have committed themselves to spread systematicly to their clients of free-contact cards," Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the way of paying the future: the mobile phone.
A few apparatus are currently equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) necessary for transactions.
"They took the delay."
"But they should finally know a real essor next year."
"Our sales tables of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the fronts.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next to Caen.
The iPhone of approximately 200 clients and clients will be equipped with an etui allowing uncontact payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also said yesterday to prepare the marketing of a offer that allows her clients to pay without contact with their mobile.
Du Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front was
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaida and the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram Section.
The links between the al-Qaida terrorist group and the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
Saturday, the Algerian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Mesahel, even said that Alger now "acquired the security".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of information services show that there is a good cooperation," he explained without further precision.
Paris → make a similar analysis.
In January, the investigation on the rapt of two French in Nigeria would have been made on the past.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by neighbors of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delة were killed on the next day as many of their ravisors during a operation that was held by the French special forces.
In the breaks of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers find several telephone puces belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the past calls leads to several partners based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to the Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly interested in researchers: a train to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city from the north of Nigeria, a boko Haram barceau, and the other to a man who is close to Aqmi and the section.
"This is an advanced but it is certainly necessary to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known that the sect benefits of external financial and intellectual support and that it is more active," Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In the past months, these "appuies" have been more evident in the development and talks of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now include the recovery of camekazes or explosive engines more complex and the same factor as those used by Aqmi.
Thus, the international community, starting by Washington, pressed Abuja to take into account the problems of Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of unworthly interested irrelevants.
Quick success
Funded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a Mohammed Yusuf mosque, a school and imanist, Boko Haram - which increasingly means "the west education is a sin" - is the establishment of a islamic emirate in the north Muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, there is a quick success.
It policyes and requires strict respect for the charia while its soldiers commit the fight against the wicked central government.
The latests refer to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's soldiers were particularly active, multiplying attacks against Commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, as its habit, without nunces.
The army invested in the city, 800 dead are counted.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
So the sect will radicalize and leave its fifs from the north.
At the last Christmas, she returns an attention that makes 80 dead in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram still takes it to the secure QG of the police during a suicide attack, his first.
At the end, the United Nations local seat will be its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia, which now concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, which the Somalians of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a negotiation in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé watched Boko Haram and said "to share all information".
The World is the Republic's candidates at the presidency
On China, on Iran, on assistance to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are simplified and ignorant.
Can a American weakness by the crisis handle a complex world with simple or even simple ideas?
In listening to the Republican presidential candidates, electors could believe it.
Since a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied tonitruating statements and advice on foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republical point.
In China, in Iran, in Israel's assistance, the slogans - often not steadfast - are.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the course in the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to travel Chinas before the WHO and to take them "for the manipulation of their currency", a portor theme in a America exhausted by its entire industry to Asia.
So much if this should involve the start of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in Obama and only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, failed to interfere with an attitude that "flates" emotions.
He called to a muscle but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depths of the surveys, remains inappropriate.
At Reagan Image
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran, he's fanfaroning."
"If Obama is resumed, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised the military aid to Israel to defeat Obama's obligations against this partner.
Undertaker Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, shows him an embarrassing ignorance of documents.
Recently, he called against the Chinese military threat because Pékin "trys to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignorant because China holds the military atom since 1964!
The Texan Rick Perry Governor, who supports Israel and wants stripes against Iran, said ready to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cards.
Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann are also preconceived to torture against the presumed terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opposers of the current president replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water into his wine in the matter of anti-terrorism.
They are reasonably insisting on the failure of his naiv dialogue with Iran, on the outcome of the "boys" of Iraq, on its territory in Libya, which thus brings him a low label.
But the attack is not so easily.
The population is a positive view of the national security balance of Obama, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, it has lacked military interventions that lead to discharge.
And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resume its leadership, Obama hits more fair.
North Stream, new Russian Gas entry gate in Europe
The North Stream Gasoduc, directly linking West Europe to Russia by covering the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gaseous gentleman, wanted to celebrate the event with eclate.
More than 500 guests whose four government leaders participated on the Baltic borders on Tuesday, between orchestra and buffet fin, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gasoduc that directly connects under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, the German Channel Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his approved Netherlands Mark Rutte turned into the flighting of the wall that commanded the Russian gas entry into the western European network.
With this new gasoduc, 27.5 billion extra Russian gas gas gases will arrive each year by a 1 224 km first tube connecting the region of Saint-Petersbourg in the Land of Mecklembourg-Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, allowing to deliver at a total of 55 billion cubes of gas or the equivalent of all French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third of the same parks is already stated.
For Gazprom, the end in time and hour of this huge Chantier has victory air.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will actually allow direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any earthquake by a third country (Polonia or Ukraine).
On the other hand, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to spend Russia by threatening him to close access to West European markets.
In the strongest debate, Varsovie did not have to compare the North Stream with a "new German-Soviet Pacte", with regard to the covenant between Hitler and Staline to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support to this Russian project, has gained greater security of its provisions.
But it is at the price of a weakness of energy Europe, since the project has created a breach between Eastern Europeans and Western Europe.
In five years ago, Russia knew to triomph its vision of a direct covenant between Russia and the rich oqal countries, highly gas consumers, and their gears are declined.
"This gasoduc is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that reads us organically," Frances Fillon confirmed by inhibiting this gasoduc, demonstrating how political and economic large gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles shown by Gazprom's leaders, present in Lubmin, at the gas array point.
The construction of this gasoduc is also a technical exploit.
The submarine tube is in beton-gained steel to protect it from the boats' anchors.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 m in the average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields dating the Second World War II.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed by caution, " indicates Jens Mıer, North Stream's password.
It was also necessary to multiply the measures to protect fauna and flower.
The tube is a long metal serpent, heavy as 242 Eiffel tours, that nothing interrupts over all its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was scheduled in the width of Sweden, but the responsibles of the project rejected it while the Swedish were unnecessary to see a Russian State company staying at the width of their coasts.
"In the case of avaries, we stop the gas pass in less than a minute", says Jens Mâer.
In the case of escape, the gas contained in the gasoduc, therefore, escape into the air.
However, this case is deemed small by producers who have planned the sudokus to know a fleeting every 100 000 years.
The monitoring of the gazoduc status is ensured by a sub-sea robot, trained by a ship, for external observation, and by a device within the gasoduc.
From the form of a cigarette, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of a meter of diameter, and it is moved by the gas.
After three full days of trip at 3 seconds, he provides specific information about the possible metal deformations.
The gasoduc was designed to work for fifty years without to take up the minimum repair.
Gas is simply assured by pressure.
It's 200 bars at the outside, and 100 to the arye.
Five companies have joined their forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who holds 51% of the parts.
Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and the Netherlands Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies created a common company called Nord Stream, loaded to build and operate gasoduc.
It has its seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then praised this company, for twenty renewable years, the total gas transport capacity.
" Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whether the quantity of actually transported gases, " says Jens Mâer.
The financing of the gas construction was 30% of the shareholders and 70% of the loans.
The total cost of travels should reach 7.4 billion euros for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment was 240 million.
But the minority actors are safe to return to their costs, as only Gazprom’s risk is.
The gasoduc of the Baltic in Lubmin, on a samplenous literal plant of pins.
Valves, a height of 4,5 meters, forms the gas output door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificity of the gas that comes before it is transferred into the German gasoducs.
Since Wednesday, this terminal has received a million cubes of Russian gas at each hour.
In full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a mark book.
Created a fifteen years ago by a Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the go of the writing.
He has a perfume of aventures, last hours to write in the light of a bullshit.
The Moleskine book is easily performable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its feet of a white broken color, as old as along the time.
However, the book of Moleskine as we know him today was born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo Company, based on Milan, decides at the time to launch a design book but separate notes.
Maria Sebregondi, then consulting for the company, is charged for the launch of the new product.
The book is inspired by an ancient production technology, the skin mole (food) that draws a vernis cotton used to cover bankets, for example.
This type of book was very emptied by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine gave to the go of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the pre-gard artists, until the 20th century " , Ra_ Maria Sebregondi, became responsible for the mark at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
During 2006 to 2010, the profits increased by 26% in order to establish 12.7 million schools.
We are far away from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3.000 books were designed.
Molekyne exceeds the Italian borders and exports into 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a portrait robot of the buyer, because the book of notes seduces the businessman as well as the student and professionals.
In the picture of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolite, open and cultivated.
The Italian small company, which had 12 employees at its beginning, has nearly 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the libraries, from the Fnac to the small centre-town boots and has introduced her identity.
"We followed the air of the time and this new need for writing, despite the e-mails, " explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanys the development of Moleskine: recently, the mark has launched a "Return" exposure where artists or artists are exposed to their own book.
In alô, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Professor of his success and this cultural aura, Moleskine suggested diversifying its products: sacs, agendas, computer woods... The mark is declining on a whole range of supports.
Success that made age: in August 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now Syntegra Capital, writeing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the rate of unemployment of handicaps remaining so high?
Approximately 19% of the handicaped people are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabilities is open today.
Despite a voluntary policy established in 2005, the rate of unemployment of handicaped people is even twice higher than the average: 19 per cent, against 9 per cent for the population.
Decorative?
"No, it emphasises E日 Blanchet, Director-General of the Adjustment, who organizes the week for the employment of the disabilities."
" The progress made for fifteen years has been significant. "
At that time, the rate of unemployment was not two but three times higher.
" However, it remains great to do."
It is important to say that for the unemployed unemployment, obstacles remain a lot before the employment arrives.
They are rather old: 37% are more than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a less high level of qualification: 80% are not responsible, and over 2.3 million higher education students, only 10 000 are disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very expansive: 53% for handicaps, against 38% in average.
Shortly, as many criteria that comply with the fully return to employment and which " constitute the node of the problem ", Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, was created in 1992 to help undertakings recruit hard workers.
This is for the targets.
It remains the non-dit, the mentalities that develop, certain, but too slow.
A study conducted in April by IMS-Enterprise for the City indicated that the interviewed managers have " a low knowledge level of handicap " with " overrepresentation of persons in rolling chain, psychical or intellectual deficits. "
Consequently, private companies of more than 20 salaries are still far from reaching the employment goal of 6% of disabilities established in a ... 1987 law.
The last numbers with, which date from 2008, are 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blaová, Director-General of the Agefiph, the charge of collecting the contributions of enterprises that do not respect this law.
The evidence: the number of " taxed " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, with 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Law, which increased contributions, made a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Bla. "
" But this improvement also translates a true conscience, especially in the large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of 20-49 employees are employed in disabilities against 82 per cent of 100-199 employees.
Hazard: "Felicity"
Before confronting the Blue Tuesday evening (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they were looking for this friendly match.
We're not going to write until there was a conviction between them, but the image is symbolic.
Aside coast on the street of the auditorium of the Stade of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace and peace.
Five months after his attack on Turkey, the Belgian elector only has a reasonable reason for it.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go forward," assured Lillois from her side.
As regards the contrast between its performance in club and choice, "is it a whole, if he justified."
"Lille, I'm all the year ago, which isn't the case with the vegetable."
"I need to take my marks."
Measured against Romania Friday evening for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis for the end of "briller".
Without prejudice to the meaning of "pleasing".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 years and the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supporting," he says.
In force, this involves further strengthening the "special" character of this meeting.
As in the face, "There are Matthew (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he replies.
"We crossed up all the time."
"Please play against them, it's just happiness!"
With bonomy, Leekens for his part called "very".
"Free" of disp is a gala match.
"Fetted" also to find - in quality of "voisin" that France is "recommended a very high-level team" a little more than one year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Bla," he enthusiashed.
While the Ethiopian will miss the next Euro, the technician would well share the plane with the Blue Direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little ones become big," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to take account of this in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confidential
Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimists to return to Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the other hand, the two teams had missed realm.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, especially, a happy country."
Paulo Bento has already seen it in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt of the shadow, the Selecçao, who is at the hands since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and a opponent, Bosnia, to deploy.
In view of the match to go (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seemed evident that the games were not made.
Portugal has dominated the part for more than one hour, of course, but it was impossible to mark this so precious purpose, which would have sought it.
"It's a good result, which, however, has a certain risk because we have not marked a goal outside."
But with them, in their amazing La Light's Stade in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, before a public that should be there too wounding, even though the part is obviously announced "very locked," said a optimist but luminous Bento.
"We're waiting for a very busy match, but we're really convinced that we can take it over," said the Portuguese trainer of 42 years.
"We continue to have 50 per cent of chances to be in the Euro 2012," even though Carlos Queiroz' follower has related.
The novel reported Friday in Bosnia requires the Portuguese to mark and win.
A nine can provide the Bosnians, which also need to mark.
"It is a good result, however, that has a certain risk because we have not marked a goal outside," Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team with many technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he said.
Like Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to make a maximum pressure on the Bosnians so that they will not " give them the time to think. "
A good idea, in the condition of being realistic this time.
