"The uniqueness of the current session, in my view, is that the ritorial to which we have been almost used in the past years against Russia was now in order to be more deep," said the senator in an interview repeated on Sunday the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in the past years, the RF was "one of the three main threats of Ebola, as well as the Ebola Ebola, as well as the climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any case, in the exposure of a group of western countries that had been expressed sufficiently single for this account."
At the session, Kosachov emphasized, "the Russian theme was practically disabled in a negative key."
"If you carefully examine the statement of the President of the United States, President of France, the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Greece, or British, in any case, people were not sufficiently accurate," he noted that Russia "I'm not greater than a wall that trains the attacks by the tennis bottle."
The Chapter of the Professional Committee of Sophed does not exclude that it testifies of a trend that, according to his opinion, " will be held to the current session [On the United Nations Assembly], although this trend may be completely manifested in a year after two, three."
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense might be a reverse," Kosachev explained, "too many examples of how Russia's connection is able to move forward in cases."
As an example, he brought situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Until this is, unfortunately, not Ukraine, but I do not doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be deteriorated with time," added the parliamentary.
This is with this, he believes that "adequate, healthy advice of Russia as not simply possible - an independent participant in the solution to global problems of modernity."
"I don't want to fail, but I have a feeling that we're going somewhere a point for which the movement will no longer be moved, it'll be a move forward," he added.
Another "interessable and important feelings" in this context called "request for a Russian vision of how modern world should be developed".
"I attended a lot of meetings of the Chapter of the Russian Delegation [at Genasembla's session] Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sergei Lavrov, and I was very pleased to see that if the Russian view of the world was two or five years ago, the Russian view of the world, no one was interested, the situation would be different now," said the president of the Committee of Sophed.
It considers that "the new liberality that is called for the West has no answers to the way to solve global problems in the world ' s clear deficiency of ideas in the global space, the deficiency of ideas in the way to resolve the problems of the Middle East, the terrorism, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the migration problems."
"And here the request for Russian vision becomes more and more evident," stated Kosovo's confidence, underlined that it considers "the current session of the Russian delegation successful for Russia".

In the "Loko" cat - "Achmat" errors of Turbine fell like the horn of the exhaust
The former Judge of the universal category Vladimir Levitin's procommence of Turbine's arbitr in the 9th tour of the Russian campaign "Locomotive" - "Achmat" and has discovered the events of the game.
- How do you appreciate Turbin's judgement in the "Locomotive" cat - "Achmat"?
- I think that this arbitr has confirmed his inappropriateness to the judge of the Russian Prime Minister.
I'm deceived that the efforts at the fifth "Spartak" meeting - "Dinamo", either Turbins and the RUSs did not make serious conclusions on its low-quality.
The result was not quiet to say in the nineth tour: the mistakes in its actions, the private cross-up of receipt was like the horn of exhaustity.
For example, for the 50th minute, Eder's railway wallets with hands in his trailing area, the Protector of Ahmata Rodolfo.
From the gate eight meters, but Turbine doesn't put the tools.
- How do you appreciate the episode of Iddo, who was in the 82th minute when it seemed that the ball fell in his hand?
- I think there was a planning game with a protector's hand here in his shopping area.
Turbine was near the moment, well seen this episode and his first right assistant.
This time was to be seen by the Reserve Judge Sergei Karasev.
Yet, three of them were not assigned, and the tools were not appointed.
That is why the account in the bag is depreciated, and the fairness of the destruction is justified.
That was the same case when the judges were deceived and buried the spirit of the game.
- To 52 minutes, Turbin didn't decide to remove Oleg Ivan's guest protector, who violated the rules in the fight against Crichovak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstrated his fruit.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second "sheet"?
- Turbine and the first yellow card showed no longer the case.
The second would be unlogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the torture of the double standards of judgement that some teams put the tools for violations such as in the episode with Ida and no.
What do you appreciate the words of the footballist?
- He's thinking what to understand under double standards.
There were tools.
They didn't give it.
So the arbitr doesn't give the second tools to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second moment of double standards, which the judge looks at who plays.
This is the same thing on the "Locomotive" Sabbath, and Ahmata has serious claims to Turbine because the team was deteriorated.

U.S.A. has been reported on the Russian maritime blocking because of oil and gas supply
In the United States, Russia's marine blocking can be started to benefit the world's energy market.
The American authorities had so much success in the world market that they were willing to reach the Russian sea block, which remains one of the main world energy providers.

Despite the world ' s world concern, the American Ministry of Internal Affairs performs not police but civil functions, including natural resource policy.
Therefore, Zinke's statement was completely in the competence of their knowledge, although there was no political decoration.
As a result of the industrial activities in Pi'sburg, Zinke stated that by the United States' military forces, they control the seaways in the nearest region and that they may be locked if necessary.
In Zinka's words, the need may be with Washington's desire to prevent Russian supply on the world energy market.
Zinke said that Russia continues to receive a share of its income from the provisions on the world market of oil and gas.
It was also the main motive for the enhancement of Moscow in the Middle East.
The Minister is able to understand that the United States are still considering the leadership of the world's energy market, which has become the greatest oil and gas supplier.
To this end, Washington must be disturbed by Russia and Iran, and the marine trade blocking, which is the adoption of a measure in this way, considers Zinke.

Valery Belov: Lord has helped the Siberies today
The main "Vietja" trainer Valery Belov - on the damage from Siberia (3:4) in the category of the KHL regulatory campaign.
"The college has spoken about Siberia's sisters, and I want to note our sisters," says Bellow's official website "Highway".
"I hope that they will support the same as because nearly every game is a full stage that is a great atmosphere.
At the game, the Lord probably has helped the Siberies today because they have been very deeply wrong, especially our leaders.
In fact, we lost a micro-mate 0:3 of our leaders, so we were hard to take this bitch, even though there were moments.
But at least, I'll be guilty of myself.
Because it seems to be lost, something in preparation.
Compared to the past morning, it was another team."

Lookers are forced by the choice of Agu in the "Goles" show
The "Golos 60+" shower accuses the teacher Leonid Agu's in "invisible cutting and increasing bathroom".
When he from the first note recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Ahhu in blind hearings, many hoped that he would keep neutral and would not return to the artist.
But the son's feelings were taken, and he chose his family in his team.
Then many thought this as a shit, but they forgave the teacher's ineffectiveness at the first stage.
But the "success" went out, and the father of the star was absolutely unjustly taking place to more valuable artists.
And now the lookers are not ready to forgive Agutina such injustice.
Yesterday, we looked at the show, and we were forced by an improper and openly protashired with our neighbors to the final stage.
I had even doubted that Agutina had enough strength and conscience to not get to the end of his father to the first time," Irena Petrovski and Xenia Larin were discussed in the television program.
However, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "sliel" artists who truly sing, while Nikolai Peterovich had spent a touching song about his mother, explaining this by saying that the lookers want to continue to see his father's show.
But it seems that it doesn't mean that the lookers want an objectivity and see really talentable artists in the final, and Agutin now discreds a show.
"Appealing to the vote party from the Agu team -- they were concerned."
"The last time, Augustine showed how he loved his dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional."
"Concurrs lost his sense."
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave his father who doesn't sing, and how can you then call a teacher?"
"He likes a song of daddy, organize him a concert in Cremele for your money and see how many people come on this concert."
It's the "Gols" show, not the "Crute families" show.
"On the side of Agu it was unprofessional."
"Then, on your own show, you need to propose to speak to Daddy, not to the show that is done for the 1 Canal money."
"This was a real chance for someone and he took some place.
And I don't understand why the unbalanced dad should cause me to understand more than any other party with real eye data.
Why was the slave from Surguth with a great voice and a temper, and the father of Agu brought to the end?
And then we all regret that on the scene and on the screens are the same for decades!
"But it is not because it is not a trial."
"What did you expect?
That's Russia!
Round blue and cushion.
Yes, the money in the family budget will not be enough!
The theater of absurdity continues!"
The students also remembered that in one of the traditional " Voice" seasons, the son of the City came out on blind hearings.
Then the metro wasn't supposed to take the son into his own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all understanding."

Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To take attention to such things, it's an unwide foolishness.
I'm not absolutely aware of what Carrera's doing.
It's just deepening the disorder in the team.
First, it's verses, reading and understanding.
I would never respond to Carrera.
Everyone has his own opinion.

Kemerovchan washing the sheep of the bars on the bathroom

"These are the graves, not the shepherds.
Nothing I'm trying to do there.
The bars, of course, do not say that they are worth, but it doesn't matter."
Anyway, some of the evidences noted that the issue of animals is already in the middle of the bag, and the measures will be taken shortly.
Do you want to pull and do it right?
The words are not pressed.
That's right.
The word "drop" means "drop, show influence, effect" is only phonetically because we hear the sound [a] instead of the word "drop".
We use this word, thinking that it happens from the word "press".
But "pressing" and "drop" are not just close, but even in some sense are opposed.
Make sure that is yourself.
To draw (the church, the chief, the older) means "adequate, full, enough, enough to be satisfied for anyone or anything."
Happy, pleasure is family words.
Earlier, he had the meaning of "nothing depending on anything, having self-compatible importance" -- "build yourself."
The oldslovakian "wheel" familyly with the words "wheat" and "will".
Giving, pressing, it's all other.
These words are actually fearing "family": daos - "volk" (the dead sheep), dey - "dead" and "duidi" - "treat".
Similarly, the phonetical form of words "pressing" and "drop" as well as the imminent olderness of the last were forced to enter them into the contents.
So we had the same "d" input, which are also used through "a" in writing, which, in fact, is wrong and is not in the view of the processes of emergency and development of these words.
That's right.
But this word is older, in its proper meaning it is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/persons have a negative impact on you, use the word "does".
It may also be used to show pressure, but remember that it will be the end.
