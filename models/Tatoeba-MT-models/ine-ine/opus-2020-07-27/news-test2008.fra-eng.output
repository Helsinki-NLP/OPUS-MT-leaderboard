Inflation, in Europe, has lost food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid inflation of food prices.
In November, price in the 13 countries of the euro area was more important than the previsions, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent has been registered, stated the European Community statistics office in Luxembourg.
The official provisions indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian Central Banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not decrease the rate of the direct interest by saying that the reduction of interest, with the growth of the prices of primary materials and the rate of unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationist spirit.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but nearly two percent.
According to an analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "the inflation must be dissuaded" so that it does not have any more to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3,3 per cent is a record during the last twelve years and in Spain, it has increased from 3.6 to 4.
Inflation in the euro area has resulted in rapid consumption of food and energy prices.
The market shares at the end of cereals have increased by 88 per cent and the soja course has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and milk products also increased in 2007.
This year, the global oil price increased by 52 percent and, last month, a black gold baril costs almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the rate of inflation will pass by 2.5 per cent this year, but in 2009 it will be decreased by 1.9.
According to the analystes, the inflation rate of 12 months remains about 3 per cent, however, in the next 3 to 4 months, the annual average rate will be 2.5 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the rate of the director twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of parties of Fidesz (Young Democracy Alliance) has increased significantly early December, and since 2002, it has now been the largest number of parties, while Gallup (The Research Institute) has never seen such low socialist support, which is 13 per cent.
For faithful electors, the difference would, due to the greatest determination of opposition electors, represent a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of one fifth (20 per cent) for MSZP (Hungrian socialist party).
According to the survey, MDF (Hungrian Democrats Forum) and SZDSZ (Free Democracy Alliance) are below parliamentaries: their support is two per cent throughout the population.
On the faithful electors, some voting votes increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to delay with the lowest point, the proportion of those who believed that the economic situation in the country was particularly severe has never been so high, it is 41 per cent, and 46 per cent additional situation is quite serious.
According to the most optimistic perspectives of the early and the latest, the families are more pessimist about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population provides an increase and only one tenth provides a improvement in the situation.
In December last, 71 percent of the investigated persons, which were never seen in the previous Gallup surveys, thought that the Prime Minister did his work rather than good.
13 percent of the surveys have confidence or many confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent are not full confidence in the Prime Minister and 27 per cent in the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in political situation is the proportion of the company that thinks that the miscontent against the Prime Minister can be treated without government change.
As the last October issues, 35 per cent of the investigations wanted the Government and the Prime Minister to remain in responsibility, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
In the matter of vote, 60 per cent of the audits answered that they would certainly vote, and 20 per cent additional say that they would probably vote.
To compare, only 55% of the surveys would be involved in the next Sunday, and 15% of the additional would probably participate.
74 per cent of people would not say to the rights of registration in higher education, 79 per cent would not say to the costs of consultation and 84 per cent would not say to the cost of residence at the hospital.
When we look at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote to the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of registration, consultation costs and residence costs at the hospital.
Auchan is the most dear, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarketing in Budaörs' commercial triangle maintained the average price estimation of 16 per cent of the last year to the difference that the rate of the VAT in this year did not increase.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the trade triangle of Budaörs, the usual Daily Century Panel also increased by 16 per cent in average, an increase in value just greater than thousand forints appeared in all hypermarked.
The prices, which were already involved in the large food stores in the last December, have no longer increased brutally compared to the high base.
However, consumers are obviously surprised to see that the articles purchased just below nine thousand forints in the last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Panel in the survey markets exceeded 91 forints, at least 10 000 forints.
And the highest value of the carrier was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6 800 forints.)
The prices of the Unicum and the living fish have remained almost at the level of last year, but the prices of the bridge, noise and pavot have increased strongly.
In magazines, the price of meat and bread followed the data of the KSH (Center Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, only 139 forint bread was found.
The competition did not decrease the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, too, in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it costed only 257 forints of the bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of Lord daily, Auchan was the most dear and the least dear Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of his Daily Lord with 15 per cent while Tesco and Auchan increased them from about 18 and 18 per cent respectively.
In comparing the most dear pair of the last year and the less dear pair of this year, we find a 12 percent division while the difference between the less dear and the dearest year of this year is 21 per cent.
Prices increased by 1 480 in average.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 in average, knowing that the impact of the TVA rates had already been observed in the last year's Christmas prices.
This process made the trade perplexe, and the hypermarketes could not determine ́ what margin to apply on products so far as they were able to predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If a trademaker fails to calculate the rotation of a product, it may lose a great profit from the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
As a result of the change in the rate of the VAT, the daily Panel's prices have developed in such a way that the most dear patrol was more than 1 720 forints than the value of 2006, while the difference between the less dear payers was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so significant because the value of the most dear patrol was greater than 1 630 forints than the last year and the less dear prices also increased by 1 284 forints.
Reporting to the two Christmas samples, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumption articles increased more than 30% in hypermarked.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for certain foods of first need, the statistics institution has found an increase in prices more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of harvest and egg.)
According to the daily Panel of this last, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, already dear last year, has increased almost more than 10 per cent compared to the basis.
According to the indications, the feed suppliers take a stronger position than the egg suppliers because they have been able to accept the brutal employment of prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hypermarketes are not complained, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, the majority of customers are no longer looking at the prices in the three visited hypermarkets.
They buy all in quantity, take long-containing food by palettes.
Wednesday morning the important queues were shaped in the boxes of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers has increased brushfully.
However, our information, the number of businesses is less important in the province, many multinationals complain about not even reaching the number of business planned, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption articles.
Many hospitals make economy on deinfectants
This year, more than thousand infections, mainly caused by wrong use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the number of insufficient beds, the supermanagement of the medical staff are not helping block infections, says the doctor's head of the National Centre of Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also make economies on deinfectants
There was no longer a MRSA infection in the Janos hotel traumatology service.
Resistance to antibiotics was detected on a hospitalized man due to a serious accident.
The disease was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred at the same place.
The wound of a serious car accident came out of the hospital but a little while after it was able to return to it because of a MRSA infection and, since, the doctors were not able to make her an important operation because of the agency in her body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1 094 hospital infections generated by a multiresident pathogenic agent have been declared to the National System of Nazional Monitoring, Karolina Böröcz, a doctor of the National Centre of Epidemiology.
To know that this is the number of infections caused by a multiresident pathogen agent who has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, otherwise by staphylococcus resistant to methicilline-oxaciline.
A third of the people are porters of Staphylococcus aureus in their nose without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (as anginas, amigdalites, skin infections, traumatic infections) are well responsible for antibiotics, they are easily healable.
However, if antibiotics are used in a rough or inappropriate manner, the antibiotics, which reacts well, will develop a well-resistance to antibiotics that will quickly proliferate in bad hospital conditions.
In the case of a temporary or prolonged immune system, this substance may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sexicemia, on age, small weights or with a weapon body.
According to the doctor of the Janos hospital, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are parts of the hospitals' day.
In particular, you don't need to confuse the infection with the epidemic, you don't only find MRSA or not seek them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These diseases are isolated, the healthy staff puts in caoutcho and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to cure them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
In the first place, hospitalized patients are examined whether they are MRSA porters, but infection cannot always be avoided.
The sample is not in the mode
The majority of MRSA infections could be predicted but the current conditions and circumstances are not favorable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multiresident pathogen agents, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is particularly shown in hospitals and residences for elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalized sicknesses and immediately isolate MRSA sick ones.
However, the microbiological practice is not at the mode in Hungarian hospitals.
It is necessary to know that the National Social Security Case does not finance these reviews.
Most of the cases see the day only if MRSA infection is detectable on the disease, the doctor has said the head of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the adjusted use of antibiotics in medical health and there are also Hungarian directives for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Ancient antibiotic therapy needs to be targeted, otherwise microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent medical resistance, but hospitals do not always take account of it.
The realization of microbiological practices is even rare in ambulatory care and basic cares, Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals make economy on deinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferate from one disease to another as often through medical staff.
It is therefore primarily to wash hands, to put pins and protective masks, but important lacunes are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSA proliferates by inhalation of gouttelets and by contact. However, because of conditions in Hungarian hospitals, contaminated disease cannot always be isolated.
Moreover, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemic, sick ones should be removed from each other at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situation, make economys on deinfectants, lack infirmers, sick ones are many, so the risk of contamination is even bigger, stated Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in demonstrable way or then the proliferation of the patogen agent can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenditure for social security boxes, so we fight all over this infection.
For example, the Government set up a programme to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSA.
According to data, this programme is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in the land.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of diseases (ECDC) provides among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multiresident pathogen agents (as MRSAs) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogenic agents.
The Commissioner, author of a mortal accident, was not in a drinking state
The official evidence of the death caused by the Commissioner of the 22th Arrondment has been drawn up.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22th Arrondment, deputy of his post since, who has broken a piece by providing his death last Tuesday, would have led to a drink or a turd state, held on Friday Attila Morvai, portfolio of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the related evidence has been established.
The outcome confirmed the first result of the investigation that already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before the flight
Last Tuesday, the ancient Commissioner of the 22th Arrondment broke a 55-year-old man in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in the Kossuth Lajos Street of the 22th round. The man wanted to pass through the road, not by the passport for pittons.
(In addition, the fact that he passed the way outside the passport for pittons does not constitute a disturbing circumstances, the Road Code of a car that burns a virage must leave the pittons.)
The pitton died after it was transferred to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner left his post and asked his retirement because, by the police's communication, this accident was very disturbed.
The investigation on this matter is conducted by the Parquet loaded for Budapest investigations.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the judges charged to conduct the investigation.
400 million additional euros for infrastructure
Janos Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed, on Friday, in Budapest, three agreements of a total value of 400 million euros on a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of 300 million euros for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties, and the signed contract relates to the use of 200 million remaining euros.
The 150 million euro credit agreement also relates to the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB totally approved a sum of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million could be used later after the extension of the credit contract.
The Parties signed a 50 million euro contract for innovation, and the State budget will first use this contribution in the research and development project to be carried out at the Debrecen University.
During negotiations, the project of line 4 of the metro was also addressed.
Parties agreed that they would reexamin the possible amendment of the initial contract when Hungary will complete the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to Janos Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its credits to EURIBOR, with a period of 8 years and without commitment committee.
Bulgaria, Paradise of the EU Immobile Market
The development of the Bulgarian immobiliary market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this country of Balkans, which has been quoted by the past.
What, or who and who bought on this EU market that is still the less dear but who will become quickly dear?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is the most involving goal in East Europe with its ski apartments and homes at the board of the good sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and, at the sea border, Albena, the Gold Sales, the "South of the Sun", the old Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are more increasingly looking for an immobile in Kavarna and Baltic region.
According to the analystes of Re/Max Bulgaria, soon or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also wake the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very little dear Russian corner.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade and office surfaces promise the highest rate of abortion.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus to be a priority destination, after the sea season and winter season, also in the two other seasons of the year.
The most supervisory investors already buy a large number, for example in Bansko's corner.
According to the analystes, people buying an immobile in Bulgaria seek at the same time to change their lives, their way of life.
Most purchasers are low, but others come from France, ↓, Spain, and more from Romania.
Malta investors and chypriots are also present. At the board of the Black Sea and in the most estimated ski stations, we traditionally meet a lot of Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are going to install are buying renewed insurance, at a price between 50 and 100 billion euros, or from old deployed houses, to a price of 5 to 15 billion euros, which are then renewed.
The criteria are easily access and communication opportunities, nearby a large city, stores, and generally the local doctor's.
The second group includes secondary residential buyers (from December last, Bulgaria has been quoted among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who are in the hope of purchasing a higher average or long-term value.
The price of capital immobilisations grows increasingly because of a higher request.
In the European Union, immobile prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years they have increased by 21 percent each year.
Immobilization prices are primarily exceeding the salaries.
Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to the Communication of Gábor Fodor, the Ministry of Environment and Water, professional meetings will be ended on Tuesday, however, on Monday after official opening, Ministers' negotiations on international climate regime will continue after 2012.
Experts and politicians coming from 192 countries will discuss on the Bali Road Fe, which must be defined after the reduction period of emissions set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this point, living discussions have been conducted between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, at the moment, they did not want to discuss precise numbers, however they were willing to sign a reduction agreement until 2020 from 25 to 40 per cent compared to 1990.
Another important subject of the conference is to see whether developed countries are committed, without reducing emissions, to provide financial and efficient aid to the countries needed.
A agreement was also signed on assistance to developing countries.
The support fund set out by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Governing Board of 16 members likely under the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), which Piac is Profit (Marché and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role in amiral ships in global efforts to protect climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reduce its gas emissions by 20% before 2020 in comparison to the level reached in 1990, independently with the success of the ‘Accord after 2012’ signing, and was ready to reduce them to 30% if the other large regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to take commitments adapted to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol signing countries had totally mentioned a reduction of 5.2 per cent and the 15 EU members of that time took the commitment by 8 per cent in less than.
Hungary took the commitment to reducing emissions of combustible gas by 6 per cent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, reminds the pressure of the Ministry of Environment.
The end is great in Bali because the international long-term agreement on climate policy should be established within two years, other than the entry into force after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system which has been highlighted in the new IPCC, international scientific body, which has received the Nobel price of the United Nations peace, which has been charged for climate changes.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the average temperature of the Earth of more than 2 degrees could no longer be avoided, which would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British Army recruited on YouTube
The British Army units, on the video share site, provide records made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
On the other hand, this is the British Air Force (RAF) who has suffered for YouTube: special units involved in Afghanistan carrying video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, announced by the BBC.
These records are controlled at the general quarter of air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or the partners carrying them on the Internet.
The political message is incontourable
The air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this way and their "chain" has been viewed by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Defence Defence Department was registered in 2007 as "defenseheadquarters" and videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth (Commonwealth Office) and international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own chain on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos have passed on the network to recruit, and the Department of Defence also will inform the public of the real objectives of the presence of the army in the foreign.
The propaganda that this way costs practically nothing in relation to the normal recruitment publicities passed by the television, to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consulting in defence, but it also brings inevitable a political message because it justifies the well-fonded military operations decided by the Government.
The Americans have played a game
The army is embedded because, outside the composed and carefully censured videos, amateur videos have passed on the share site, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses but never present the blooding side of the fight.
Moreover, many videos have already been passed on the net presenting operation areas in Iraq and Afghanistan which were performed in real mission, but the British army has been packed for the load of these videos only a short time.
The Americans make the recruitment a little differently using the American's Army fusillade game free downloadable. In this game the player can place himself directly in the place of soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and bagnets in the ministry
Monica Lamperth, Minister of Work, is not emotional: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-year meeting with her employees who will be able to say goodbye in 2007 by taking bagnets and coffee.
Another minister will organize a festival with live music, another will enjoy officers with a tombola and will offer a drink to create a Christmas ambition.
Festival, ambition of Christmas, concerts and buffet, so the power is fun.
The authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, the greatest Christmas Festival will be organized by the Defence Minister, but these are not the employees of the Minister who will be invited there.
At Christmas, the Orphelins, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, the soldiers' families currently served in foreign missions are invited and a press receipt will also take place.
The Ministry provides a budget of 25 million forents to create the end-year environment.
In comparison with other ministers, the National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be celebrated.
The GKM Festival will be held in the Future House with a total budget of 4 320 000 forints and, on the six hundred large employees, three hundred fifty were expected.
At this festival, Christmas environment will be rigorous, there will be actors and a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas costs 4 700 000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the building of the National Justice Council (OIT) with concerts and dinners.
The location of the room costs a million forints, and the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFU service is invited to another Christmas Festival, which is organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, the Management Society of Offers Appeals.
The building of the Theatre of the Gaité was praised for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to join the responsible.
Cost is not obligatory
The OIT building was not only the NFU, but the Ministry of Justice and Police, who, instead of a Christmas Festival, organized a ball at the opportunity of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The OIT did not make them pay the use of its rooms.
This ball counted five hundred people.
The festival began with the words of the minister's welcome and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening hold was not absolutely obligatory to this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Work and Local Collections are preparing a whole party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a spectacle and a feast to its employees in its walls for 400 000 forints.
On the contrary, Monica Lamperth, the Minister of Work, does not invite his employees officially to a Christmas Festival, but to an end-year work meeting.
Eighth-eight people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat coffee, to make the press service, and to feast will also cost 350 000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, the Minister for Local Collections, will simply invite his employees to take a glass in the Ministry of Local Collections and Territory Administration.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas Festival in its large room, at which 436 employees are expected.
It accounts for 2.500 forints by invitation, including a buffet and a glass.
Since Janos Veres' array, PM's employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No planned feast environment, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's exhibition but also by the hour of the festival in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a receipt on 20 January to celebrate the new year, the Christmas Festival will not take place.
The receipt will be held at Vajdahunyad's chat, held at the City Boss, and the communication of the Minister, 1 000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail that only the foreign diplomats in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few welcome words of the Minister followed by a modesty food.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Cultural Ministry did not celebrate at all for Christmas, and the respective press services had been made to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of Environment was not aware of the price of the official Christmas Festival.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Discractive Art.
The forces of the green mega races
The Syndicates of the League and the National Association of Ova Council will be their Greece Committee on Friday which will be charged for the undetermined Monday Greenhouse.
Samedi, a General Protection Assembly will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the health boxes law, the grew will begin.
This action will certainly cause important bottles in the railways because the railway traffic will be stopped almost completely and the BKV salaries (common transport societies) will also take up until 13:00.
The Syndicates of the Ligue will inform on Friday afternoon the details of their Monday spring, organized with the National Association of Ova Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ Greece Committee will also be established and will serve as coordinator of Monday action.
Samedi, a General Protection Assembly will be held and, since Monday, the Greenhouse organizations will stop the work for an undetermined time if they cannot find an agreement with the Government.
This means that the date of the end of the greenhouse, from the day of vote to Parliament on health boxes, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the health box law, the syndicates will immediately return the call to the greenhouse.
However, if the law is voted, the Great Committees will meet and then decide to take.
According to the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly, it is considered that the vote on the law on health boxes had to take place only after night or even night.
Because of the greenhouse schedule for Monday, important bottles are scheduled in the eye: railways will stop the work for an undetermined time and during the morning a part of the common transport to Budapest, and more than half of Volán companies can be arrested.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the road will also be locked.
Many civilian syndicates and organizations have joined the call to the Greve, and the list of these are permanently updated on the site of the Ligue.
Some organizations indicate that it was undetermined, and others declared a temporary labour stop.
Until Thursday afternoon, MÁV (Hungrian railway chemistry) and the Free Chemical Syndicat (VDSZSZ) did not find an agreement on minimum services, gold, at the closest of Christmas Festivals, are more and more those who take the train.
According to the current communications, the common transports of Budapest will take from the beginning of service until 13 hours, the Budapest airport between 7 and 9 hours of the morning, the Electricity and Thermal Energy Industrial Syndicates of the Ligue will take four hours, the Professor's Syndicat and the Democratic Syndicate of Professors have been called to take care of for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours respectively.
The National Physician Association will take a step in all other countries, and the Health and Social Affairs Syndicate (EDDSZ) in SZEF will make two hours of warning.
The most important of the four complaints, formulated by the Ligue, requires that the Government repeat its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second complaint requires that the new retraite calculation method should be introduced in several steps from the next year.
The third claim wants a guarantee of retirement before the age, which would allow the system to overcome the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is to be rejected by the Free Travel Syndicat (VDSZSZ), which was ratified to the Syndicates of the Ligue, the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
According to the risk analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the Hungarian Guard's activity, latest, with the support of Jobbik Magyarhországert Mozgalom (Movement for a better Hungary), increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its ‘ risk warning’, the company notes that, in relation to Hungarian Guard's activity, the largest political risk is already that ‘the short-term aggressive ethnic conflicts may occur as a result of the increase in existing ethnic tension between the Tzigan population and the non-Tzigane of Hungary’.
The Research Institute said that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy aimed at provoking this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main parts of Hungarian political actors: "The public actors have passed the public debate on Rome's case to the representatives of radical and extreme political groups which have based a political strategy on the difference between the Zigans and the Hungarians."
The problem is severe, the normal dialogue becomes impossible, the extremists seem to be stronger, and the aggressive conflicts are greater, they say.
However, the research Institute, in the effect of increased attention to Hungarian and international media, has “the Hungarian Guard’s activity“ had significantly dealt with the image of Hungary in the foreign, in particular with regard to the confidence in the stability and democracy of the country.
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme rights groups since August 2006, many of them have been constituted in Hungary since the earlier 2007 with the name of 'national self-defence'.
"The common treaty of these races is that they are defined as a civil organization while they are saying that their adherents are prepared for defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, order defence), army, if necessary, exceeding the inaptitude of the police, the army, otherwise the state," they said.
They reported that everything was happening in accordance with the method that, based on the covering of the political and partial society, seeks to deal with various political ambitions in civil aspects.
Therefore, the accent on the civil nature and status does not only serve to avoid the legal stages of registration of these persons in the court but also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that Hungarian Guard's activity is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighborhood relations.
“In recent months, many neighbors have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential risk source and the ultranational politicists of some border countries want to justifie their anti-Hungrian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This affects the political stability of the region," they said.
According to the research institution, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, but the political risks have increased the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard revers, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in 2007.
The many troubles of Rome that have been exposed to a quarter of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are from the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
By benefiting from these events, the UN decided to constitute a watch, saying that the objective of the organization is "national self-defence".
According to them, in the past 17 years, the Ziganians have "terrified" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, reminds the Political Capital.
They said that the initiative had raised vif debates in the Bulgarian opinion.
As they say, the statement of certain Bulgarian Roma organizations on the constitution of their own guard in the direction of resistance indicates the risk of ethnic affairs.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that Hungarian Romans react to the threat of the same way by organizing their own self-defence, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of information from the Telegraph Agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institution.
As he said, their risk analysis is held every year and if events could have an impact on the change of risk, they inform the opinion, as in the present case, by a risk warning.
The festival is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the Law defines exactly the feast days and, around the feasts, it has become hard to re-evaluate the working days that the number will decrease the next year.
The festivals are also not uniform in the EU and the United States.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state festival days as well as rest days.
The rest days are often linked to religious festivals or important history events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also resting days, the last more so that the wakeholders can rest quietly.
Moreover, in a year, we have on all 11 holidays marked in red.
On 15 March, a national festival in memory of the revolution of 1848, as also on 23 October, which is the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 to 2 November, we celebrate the constitution of our status, 1 May is the holiday of work, and on 1 November and 2 November, we remember members of our family and our dead friends.
Moreover, we have two days in the Passover, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious festivals are rarely falling on a weekend, the calend; it has become hard to repeat the working days in cases, or there is only one working day before or after the feast marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of the long weekends by working or by going to the oil on Saturday on the prolonged weekend.
Since long years, the Minister of Work has been established in a special regulation on the days of replacement of days or after the feasts.
The law was responsible for all employees and all their employees, officers and employees.
However, it is not worth for services companies, institutions who turn without interruption and service, by calling and for rest days.
This year, work days will be held only around the end of the year's festivals: from 24 December, life is stopped almost throughout the country because the experiences the majority of people do in place of additional hours or take vacations that they have economyed for this purpose to be able to pass the days between Christmas and the new year with them.
The next year, many festivals fall in the middle or end of the week, thus there will be less changes at workday level than this year.
The calend_ will be repeated for the first time around the work festival to allow the salaries to stay with them four days of vacation.
The Saturday 25 April will be a working day for a vacation day on Friday 2 May.
Another amendment is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replaced on Friday 24.
Nevertheless, the next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the festivals because from December 24, everyone will take a break even if the day of the new year falls on a Thursday.
Six furious things that can be terriblely embedded by the neighbors
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that act almost more: it's things that "employ" the day of a workplace.
The question is to know whether we are habitually concerned about these anxieties or the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing anxiety to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you have been called the marketing service," said one.
That you missed a meeting?
The best he's sorry and trying to hang things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he's forgotten to pass the message (is the least current solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before having penitent explications, it is useful to think about how you can cause unappreciable moments to your ancestors and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you doing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more incredible than you want to take a document, a office tool or a phone, and you don't find them anywhere.
Remember that the guard you put the grapher on the office but she disappeared next morning?
You're going to find your thought of lost on your office?
Don't take anything to your guards without asking, else they have reason to be disappointed against you because they have picked their goods.
Don't get out of covering, post-it in your pocket because it may be impatient that there is no more and that you need them immediately.
Do you put your privacy in your lives?
There are no good ways to stop potenses that spread.
Who did what, with who?
Or why?
Don't make everyone your information (subjects) on your private life!
If a teacher shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his confidence!
Burn in you the shared information and do not discuss it with your feet in his absence even if your feet are also at the core.
Are you saying sick without just a reason?
When you call the office and tell yourself sick under the pretext of a head-break pain because you feel bad or you think you need to rest that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your missions must be done by someone else instead.
Don't worry about your neighbors!
If you know forward that the next day you're not going to work or that something may happen that will force you to stay with you, don't forget to warn your boss and your guards to avoid that they will be surprised from your absence next day.
Fedronning, ripping, phone
You're driving in your work, but the riding of your clues is brutal?
You became a witness of a telephone discussion that you'd better not listen?
Don't disturb your feet with freshness, songs, high voice discussions (which you carry above their head), feet, big words or mixtures expressed by high voice.
They can detriment even if your feet are not in a project (editation, design, organization).
Are you accusing others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send a court or a significant message, don't accuse anyone for this forget!
Don't put it on the account of the potential chaos in the office or your bruising clues!
Recognize him if you have committed a mistake and if it has presented inconvenients to others, repair the mistake!
Ask how you can repair your fault, repair the neglect!
Do you feel too close to you at the office?
Put a jogging and shoes are comfortable at home but they do not agree to the office!
Don't put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be disappointed, respect your dress and yourself by clothing correctly, and if your function requires it by putting beautiful and elegant clothes, to go work!
If you want to answer the expectations, you're not interesting anymore.
We're going to go in the usual morning mouth.
At the same time, a special melodia is heard by the radio: the voice of a violon with electronic effects associated.
I'm getting the sound up.
Music changes rythm and lowly comes to accompany the tons of all the time, then a female choral comes to it as a real babe.
Mr2 spread the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungarian musical life has not seized us for a long time with a good quality pop.
But now it seems that the bottle becomes different if you listen to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few new interesting productions of the Hungarian digital underground begin to change the image of an enonderboi and, despite the new mode of the garage rock covering the guitar, Hungarian electricop proves that there is a new one under the sun.
Baláz Záger arrived from Pıs and himself played in the Yonderboi group before he runs on his own way, perhaps because there is no space for two feet in the same shoes. ”
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz, dance music, and pop music, began to come to know when he was given the composite of filmed sound tracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season.
The training playing at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger public when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album in 2002 among the fifty most important parts of the Hungarian market and announced Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his enemy became "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to carry this label well.
The group reacted as necessary, out of a new and better disk.
The album titled Can Walk Fly Instead, recently out, can open new ways for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the years past at P′s.
It was a line of the ancient Pıs group of Balázs Zságer.
We are well with the reference to the flight but near the air music now appears, according to the mind and trend of the time, to guit it stronger, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, currently working in literature with the Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs at the first of the album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, a real tube for the radio is found, Mr.2 Petõfi, which has been distributing the popular music of the morning evening, began to introduce Wings of Love melodies recorded with six Hungarian songs ("Underground Divas").
Everything's fine (?).
hvg.hu asked questions at Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube moves me to ask a question: Is your music well staying a music with a certain bed?
Záger Balázs: The term of music referring to a certain bed doesn't tell me much.
For me there are two casts in music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but truly commercial music.
Musicals that say alternative, underground can also be mediacres and only made to sell them and thus become commercial.
However, a good pop song can also be sincere.
The attitude of receipt also works in this spirit independently of the language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and the foreign public, is one or another more open to your music?
Zs.B.: In the foreign, especially in the west, music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts, not only the young people of a dictator or twenty years, but also the elderly.
They follow much more attention to the changes in music because they think it is also part of modern culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I'm obviously happy to see people come more and more to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to reach a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important for concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is considered only in the unseenable changes of the time.
But I noticed that if you want to answer the public's expectations, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has made a career rather than western.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his way even if some people sometimes try to find tracks in our music.
Instead, we are team players who trust the musical presence of the other and let's let it grow up.
At the beginning, it was very sure that our music would be compared to Yonderboi because we are many to leave his group and take another way.
hvg.hu: On the palmarès of Mr. Peõfi, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time by the way of this song.
Having this most popular, have you opened consciously to a wideer bed?
Zs.B.: We have not planned to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to add the orgy of sounds and the most difficult topics affected on the whole disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why were they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choral of the kind of gospel.
We had the idea of composing this coral of good solists from the Hungarian music scene.
So the choral was composed to six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Jude Németh, which was then baptized underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this, or the girls got it a little?
Zs.B.: This song already exists a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that something still missed in this song.
The sequence of agreements reached the song's voice.
I sang even the melodie that the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terriblely spontaneous.
I remember that this made me crucial at the time, but certainly we needed Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same force.
hvg.hu: On the disk and on the concert, I also felt that the girls were back.
There is no soil (excluding a single short of Judy Jay), they don't have a single role, they all sing in and they don't sing stronger than music, so music doesn't just associate their song.
They were back on the scene too.
Does he want it?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind is only technical problems.
On the contrary, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute solist roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes, or, just let these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted the others to feel this euphorical state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song has made you most work?
Zs.B.: In fact, nothing about the musical creation process, we had more difficult songs when we were mixed.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert plan, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove wouldn't work for a long time, and then, small to small, everything was placed as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your preferred on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with concerts and the fact that I've already "sleep" this disc.
At this time, these are the Prophet is a fool, the escape from the Earth and Never The Same.
It's perfid to risk billions because of its inflation complex
A dissimulator fraud.
Thus, his former employee is designed by the French Gentleman General Society, owner of the Czech Bank Commercial Bank.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros.
But instead of Kerviel is only a big player who wanted to equate his legs, and who can also be considered nothing incapable.
In contrast to all the large bank houses, he recognized at times the American hypothics market crisis.
"It's fragile," let his superiors hear him who told him to the police.
However, if the deposition of Kerviel reported by the French media, including the Monde, this man's transactions have produced a profit from 1.6 billion euros at the end of the last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to win money for my bank," he said in the deposition.
The last sea, he succeeded to benefit from the American crisis to win a half billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to be issued in February, which hypothecs called "sub-prime" granted to low income clients or to those who had met in the past refund difficulties would have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the economy's intention.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its benefits are EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I had won my first half-miard, I didn't know how to announce it," Karviel said and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In all the entity, he acknowledges that he has fake the reports to not be devised.
He succeeded in duping his superiors, although the Eurex story began to be interested in its transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything doesn't have anything
Did he want to be covered?
Absolutely not.
"I thought the simple fact that I had received 1.6 billion for the bank would meet them."
Where's the will of risking so big?
He only reached his post gradually.
He started working at the General Society in 2000 just after finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary returned about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already trading assistant and in 2005 he became independent with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the other.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal partners," Kerviel investigators said.
But shortly after his entry into responsibility, he takes his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won a half half euros by putting on the low of this title at London's attendance.
And the mechanism was deployed - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you in peace
"There was like a snow bullet effect," he said to the police.
But the superiors were at the court of all, or instead, they doubted.
"When I won, they looked like closing the eyes."
But then it happens the break from the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
At mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to obscure the sum.
Monday, when he comes to work, he is no longer employed from the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that she lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we discover it?
He became suspicious because of his consequences.
"The past year, I took only four days of congestion.
A trader who doesn't take vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czech Republic at 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech Government signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the next years, bring 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
It is nearly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can be held from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns issued from seven operational programmes will be assigned to the Czech regions.
Czech enterprises will have approximately 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial means that the Czech Republic can › in the framework of these projects.
This silver will result in an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will carry out a sum of 90.8 billion crowns in the next year.
The Enterprise and innovation programme for SMEs and undertakers must use financial means to promote innovation within the company.
Undertakings should provide financial means for the introduction of news, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new more effective management methods.
Today, the Czech Republic was part of the benefits of the EU funds, among the new members of the EU.
The Court confirmed the penalty of 20 years of prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua confirmed Thursday 20 years of prison for the former President of Arnold Germany, which was condemned in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (approximately 1.8 billion crowns).
But later, he was released and was assigned to residence in his frontend near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the ancient head of this Central American State, depending on 1997 to 2002, will be incarcered or not again, according to the AP agency, is not at the moment.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison agents, or they will leave Germany to finish his penalty with him or will go back to prison.
4 years ago, the Court proved that Germany regularly moved the government's money to foreign companies accounts in Panama.
It was fitting companies and accounts were actually belonging to the members of his family and its nearest parties.
A part of this money went into the funds that Germany had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's it.
The statistical budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority of the government without support of opposition.
This year was spent a year ago by supporting the Czech socialist party - CSSD, because it was the Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and CSSD could not allow it.
In contrast to the aggressive debate, the vote of the statement of defence to the Government, this time, is nothing dramatic.
The House of Members has adopted this law without any problem, which, despite the most important, is disappointed.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether or not, each chapter and each article constitutes the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a part of the policy, even if it is covered behind the competition of power against government and opposition.
This last is more attractive in media, and therefore it is more attractive in media.
Political disputes are much more interested in opinion than in abrupt numbers.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments would suffer from three harms that the current budget is not able to resolve at the same time:
The first is the important part given to the expenditure of mandates imposed by the law, not only by the retirements, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent coalition of the CSSD and KSCHM parties.
The second is a deficiency economy, the result of the first evil.
The third obstacle, he, is constituted by the deficiency of financial funds, namely by the deficit of cities and communities.
However, this is not the deficit of the statistical budget that represents the greatest alegium.
This is strict and relatively controlled.
The real deterioration bomb is the deficit of cities and communities.
Many officers often issued, in turn, obligations, detaining their municipalities immediately, in order to, exclude money from taxes, tax rights and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they succeeded to recover these debts by sale in mass of distribution systems, in particular from energy obtained by the State in the context of privatisations.
Today, they do not have this source anymore.
If only the official and checkable facts are observed, it is found that:
Our economy has spent for many years, as the rest of the world, a growth phase and a CSSD has not missed to sell it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successful governments of this party to regulate financial funds.
Instead of this, they had the state increasingly.
Other countries, except some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their business in a much more reasonable way than our Republic.
It's a monstrous shame that is mainly resuming the governments.
We are part of the countries which, at the global scale, are less threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes that have been, just in recent years, unfortunately inutile.
Although a part of the absurd popular expenditures, approved in the last year before elections, has been able to remove, if a decrease of the age limit for travelling, as well as a reform of the retraite system will not occur next, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever is at power will only be managed.
By exhausting the power, political men can say that they will become bureaucrates that mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between traits and social performances.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes the costs to be replaced by the costs of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the governments did not discharge all their money.
If we do not really want that the policy of power becomes simple bureaucrates, we need to be patient and grant this fragile governmental coalition, aware that the State can only cost the equivalent of what is going on in tax and tax rights, the calm needed to prepare new reform laws.
There are only those who will enable gradually to achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Switzerland and Canada central banks decided to combat the crisis of financial markets.
More than 100 billion dollars will be placed on the monetary markets through business.
It will be for banks to sell the interest rates to which they are ready to pay money by a business system.
For example, the American Fed will send 40 billion dollars and will also provide 24 billion to the European Central Banks and Switzerland.
This is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to resolve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that the banks could provide," wrote in its report to Bernard Baumohl of the Outlook Group Advisory Society.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has decreased the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to approximately 50 per cent," Baumohl in its report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
The analystes are still expecting other losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they must really learn what can be followed," said the economicist of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he says.
The Central Banks fear that if the banks themselves have a difficult access to the loans, they will make their customers more dear.
This would reduce consumption and increase the US economy in a recession that could affect the world's economic growth.
The Central Banks did this choice after the rate of London, called LIBOR, was not able to decrease the interbank rate.
This means that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, despite that the American, Canadian and English Central Banks had decreased their interest rates at several times during the holiday.
"This will have the same effect as a new decreasing interest rates," said the Agency Reë's Greg Salvaggio of the Tempus Consulting company.
Some analyzes do not believe that the approach of the Central Banks will not contribute to the crisis because it does not resolve the main problem that is the fall of the immobile market in the United States.
President Klaus: The debates of the Ethiopians are incredible
Global climate changes are particularly vulnerable to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about the problem of the planet heating.
This time, the criticism has declined on the United Nations International Conference on climate changes in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue, not Green Planet, he stated that the debates of theologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, which constitutes an interesting mixture of representatives of non-governmental governments and organizations, which is inacceptable, but also the basic difference between the recipient and the reality.
"The debate is not at all, it is only a word-sheet, replaced by the solutions to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech Chairman underlined that his subject is important for him in the presentation of his book and that he is so committed to this reason.
He also showed satisfaction for what his book also appears in German translation, as he said, "I often meet only the carcature of my opinions."
Now, interested people can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus reminded that although it is not a climatologist, he, however, has enough provisions to edit such a book.
In fact, he is an academic who is able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, has statistical practices and also is economicist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the development climate, therefore the changes of it are normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on the earthquake, the effects of the current changes are not too important or too serious, therefore they represent no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate development are inutile, inefficient and inacceptable.
More than having experience of a totalitary regime, it considers it inacceptable to introduce inverted opinions to others, which it feels a dangerous impact on freedom.
In response to the issues of the present people, he explained several times that it was not against "a reasonable environmental protection but against an integral environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefit they offer."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people have not been able to renew their rights to conduct in time
Six hundred thousand drivers left the expiry of the time and failed to renew their older authorisation to conduct whose validity comes to the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still ask for renewal, so the authorities will be able to deliver them a new licence before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid authorisation will be charged.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their authorisation to conduct, especially those who do not wish to conduct anymore.
While the communes report a loss of the number of licence renewal requests, the capital authorities are invasive of applications and the number of applications for renewal of the licence has increased this week.
The Marie satisfied approximately 2000 customers daily.
There's a half hour ago.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their rights to conduct.
The release of a new licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery within a short time of five days.
In this case, the driver pays a addition of five hundred corners.
The vehicle drivers who will not be able to renew the licence to carry out the end of the year and we will take the road without a valid authorisation will rise from January.
The guilty will be forced to pay two thousand currencies at the maximum.
However, the police may also treat the infraction by seeking a friendly approach.
In the case of administrative offence, the amendment shall be broken to 2500 corners.
According to ancient information, even a person who was not able to guard was likely.
By doing this, she could be forced to pay up up to 30,000 crowns.
The Minister had invited the authorities to moderate and impose amendments not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to Karel Hanzelka Transport Minister's password, no one is able to put tens of thousands.
The authorisation to conduct is a document that people may decide whether they want or not.
It is not like with the identity card which, she, must be valid without exceptions.
People who do not want to conduct anymore should be allowed to conduct.
It is sufficient to bring or send it to the corresponding municipality.
The authorisations of conduct delivered between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of vehicle authorisation.
Persons possessed of documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years to carry out renewal.
The validity of conduct licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court reduced the penalties of the detectives pacted with Berdych
Joseph Opava and Petr Koňařík, ancient police accused of conviction with David Berdych's gang, will take 30 years of prison respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague thus condemned them permanently by decreasing their penalties respectively from 1 and 2 years.
The department's detectives for the fight against organized crime risked penalties from 14 and 12 years of prison.
It is no longer possible to call against the judgment today, but only one call to the Supreme Court is intendable.
Although Berdych is also accused of this case, he has only been the first instancy sentence.
However, he has already received in other cases of penalties exceeding 16 years of prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court recognized guilty for the participation of 19 persons in hold-up, and the Supreme Court was currently interacting with 16 of them.
The majority of the guilty repealed the accusation from the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Court of Justice of Central Bohemia, the police members, after a agreement between them with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to the officers, covered the different hold-ups and assisted the members of the band to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 percent of the larcin in Opava and Koňařík.
In the accusation there is a question of the criminal activity of the gang in 1999 to 2001.
Essentially, armed flights whose victims, in most cases, have been seriously affected by health, but also by the abuse of power of a public agent and the prohibited army.
During the household inquiries, the police, in fact, covered illegally detained guns, obses with a steel node, a wizard for the direct lazer threshold or a mitraillet.
According to the reports, the gang was rich in tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to a twenty-five men of this trial, the courts have already recognised the guilty of other hand-leaving flights of Berdych and a number of others.
Other Neighbourhood men of Berdych are still explaining themselves before the court in another court, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
The main audience for the moment prevented Tomás Pota and Maroš Šulej who are currently detained in Ireland, where they expect the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Children's replacement price: 12 million
The lawyer of Igor Veleba's families wants a 12 million crowns more expenditure from the Hotel of Träbič.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the Hostel Ondrej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We have such a reckoning, this is very high," Dostál said at the outcome of the audience.
"In order to take a view of the contra-proposal, we need the report of experts whose opposite part commanded the editor.
We're going to check if this is a explaining value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostal stressed.
The amount should be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family requested a million crowns for each month where she couldn't lift up her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, published for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document supported for depreciation negotiations.
According to psychological and psychiatric experts, parents have suffered psychological damage and have been stressed at different scales and depths.
The situation of stress was better supported by men, although they had been confronted with refunds that they did not have to prevent the substitution of newborn.
Women, they, remain less severe in front of the V. of the traumatism currently and in front of what is currently happening, resumed the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by officers at Träbič's hospital on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Chermák in Pribysla and Veronica at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The Governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčich, finally in October, reported to each of the families 100 000 coroners for the recovery of expenditure provided by the error of the Träbič Hostel management by the region.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are committed by the civil responsibility law.
In the case of lack, they must be in the reserve fund, exclusively they may ask for aid to the manager.
Until now the courts had relatively small damage, the amounts calculated according to the tables were of hundreds of thousands, especially millions.
Polygon and perdu of the Valash Kingdom (le Kingdom de Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka and perdue only litige au subject de la marque de Valašské kingdom (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the Court of the Regional Court of Ostrava, it was actually he who used the Roy of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was put on by the team around Tomas Harabish, the former actor's team.
Polívka was not present today's audience.
But his lawyer, the case is probably not finished and his client will call.
"The claim relates to the fact that Mr. Harabish and his team are faced with Bolek Polívka's popularity," the lawyer of Polívka said after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valashsko refer to everyone just this actor and comic.
Harabish is the same opinion.
"There's a job of almost ten years behind us.
Search for money and settlement of events," he said.
According to him, it's the money that's the cause of the litigation.
"In many years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are who want to parasite on our work," he said.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used for the first time the Valash King (Roy de Valašsko) in his television emission.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohati had covered him king in 1993.
However, at the time, it was not related to the project of putting on a ficticial kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came with the idea to make passports of the Valašské Kingdom appear.
From a humanitarian action from origin, there has been a business and a lucrative commercial activity followed by the creation, by Harabish, of the Valašské Kingdom society.
In 1997, Polívka accepted that his name and signature would be quoted in the passport, and even offered the pay holders on the price of the visit of its closer and theatre spectacles.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the Court also mentioned that Harabish has only made use of the naked idea, which is used by Polívka in the Maneje emission, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity de Boleslav Polívka and certainly aidée le project Valash Kingdom," said la juge.
However, it concluded that the project was constituted by Harabish and its team that was intensely dedicated to the project.
The enemies of today continued until 2000 when Harabish organized a official protection for Polívka in Vsetin.
But from there, conflicts began to combine between Polívka and Harabish, which have been assembled with the deposition "the first chosen King Boleslav forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabish, taken by the song Jarmila Shuláková as the mother of the Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka made a complaint against Harabish and his company, requesting that the court has been rejected today.
What could lead to the case is the planned tournament for the throne and half of the princess.
He should take a new king out of it.
He did not want to process details and date yet.
"We don't want to go quickly in busy.
It would be something like the royal shot in Slovakko.
The king would be chosen for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can obviously be registered," Harabish said.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
In fact, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling quality was nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, conduct and also the quality of manufacture could be qualified from less than the average.
However, it is currently on the market that follows Peugeot 207 which is just better.
As far as the SW named combi goes a step far away, it's not more than thinking better.
When I tested the classic hackback of Peugeot 207, for example, I was worried about the space for the head on the back seats.
While there you end the complaints because the carrossery means how much it means that even the big devils will be in this regard.
Let's see it quickly done.
I'm going to call the inside very quickly to not repeat too much.
This is a nearly successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems to me poor.
There, I would have loved a little more inventive design, because the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain about seats or too short records is revolved.
The Side Guide has also improved directly in comparison with model 206.
As regards the space, carrosery dimensions are also sensitive.
The combi sees also disappearing the lack of place above the already mentioned head.
A coffee in the coffee
The most important thing on this vehicle is, therefore, his baggage support.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (along with the back pivot ice) and a very easily arrimage.
The blind spaces are associated with detention elastics that constitute a perfect compromise.
It is not covered and it can be extended while it is able to hold pretty hard objects.
But let's stop the volume.
This makes, tables, 428 l in the base configuration, which is compared to competition a more average number.
Except Schkoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
If the 207 SW is compared to the new generation of Mr Boleslav product, it is found that Peugeot remains very sensitive behind, the difference is 52 litres.
When it is to go in congestion to the foreign or to load a powder, this number is almost critical.
But if I had to make the advantages, I would mention the box below after reversing the records of the seats perfectly right, or a very low walkpied.
120 horses distributed on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylindr Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what there should be nothing to do with a 1.6 who makes a family hackback walk.
He's quiet, a little consumption, and, especially, he's pulling well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Schkoda, which often gives the impression of having a pot of escape busted by a serpent, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's park the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not tolerable for all.
However, we must have aware that we have tested a quite well equipped car, with a space inside and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1,4 litres of 329 900 Kch is still employment.
The vehicle we tested cost from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
However, we have had more airbags, automatic climate, automatic glace-suite, automatic command of back windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of account 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try to guard the additional equipment at Fabia's price and you'll get a very similar number.
It is therefore only to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovaks in British schools is wrong
The number of children originating in East European countries in the British schools is growing, which causes the remaining concerns to the development of local education.
The integration of the Europeans is for instance a series of obstacles.
British schools even see where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the residents of origin are transformed into violence.
The case of the North Kent, where it begins to focus on the remaining and immigrated conflicts of Slovak origin, illustrates well the problem of integration of children originating in East Europe.
The disputes, the chicane and the baggage between the ↓s have been transposed into the relationships between parents.
The situation has gone so far that the police arrested Chatham a Slovak woman who struck a 10-year-old iron bar.
The guilty defends himself by claiming that the boy had injured him with racist matters.
The police also had to intervene after the attack against a Slovak immigrant conducted by two teenagers.
Young girls had probably addressed racist comments to this man and cast stones to him.
"When we returned home, a young man gripped on the bus stop and began to break us over.
When I told him to stop, he answered by pumps and pockets and then covered his feet," another unappreciable adventure described a mother of Slovaks.
The complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents has gone to qualify conflicts with immigrants for survival.
The higher cases show that the atmosphere in the British schools between residents of origin and immigrants begins to be tendered.
70 thousand Slovaks come to find work are recorded in Great Britain.
And approximately 30,000 Slovak schools of the British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your congestion can be done if you make a good choice.
Soft and white beaches like snow, high waves, or then a calm sea like an east.
Palms and all included with servers offering you a pizza, ice or many invasive cocktails on the beach.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the Caribbean Islands, you will not find this list only in its integrity, but enrichment.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the biggest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was the basation of their invasion in America.
Christophe Colomb qualified her as the best place that the human eye has never seen.
Havana has become the deposit and the place of transbording the treasures that the Spanish have stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was held at the beginning of the 20ths.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who made it build, because everything that was a crime in the United States (in particular under the employment) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, hazard games, prostitution.
Among his clients, there was, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-level immobiles moved and cars, which belonged to the symbols of worship in the last 50th century, were on the large bullets.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, near Havana, and, in Coyemar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and political men in the whole of America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the National Hotel Bar, a lux hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these worshipped cars have always been in Havana, since the yigoulies and jaddy fiats have already been imported for a long time in such a salt and humid climate, perri.
Although Hawaii, especially the oldest part, or sensitively decrept, nowhere else around there are so many glorious colonial monuments that there are precisely there.
Other places become beautifulr, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
In the past 15 years, new hotels have moved not only to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of the Holguin province, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be especially appreciated by the amateurs of small trains.
The canon was returned from the plants extended in sugars on a stretched road by small vapor trains and motor trains.
Their rolling material has not been renewed for decades of years and so can be seen in the way of small lolomotives whose contemporaries are not only in museums.
Where to go to his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most places with.
So there is no need to write long on Varadero or well on Havana.
Instead of reminding that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that who loves this writer should not delay the visit.
The valley of Viňales on the west of the island is one of the most pittoresc corners of Cuba.
A exuberant vegetation is putting on a calcium ground.
Mootes, calcium balls and rocks ascend into the trading of the valley's bottom, and, from the vegetable ground, even its rocks are covered with a very deep vegetable cup.
The valley is the place where you probably cultivate the cuban tabac of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the Havan cigarette manufacturers.
Someone may also find interesting that it's where the Chile episode of the Zeman Chile has been rotated.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded a little while after the Spanish colonized the island.
This is the market for the trade of slaves and the sugar that brought him glory and richness.
Richness was incarnated in the beauty and town-vitrine character of this town's decreased size.
The Colonial Spanish tecnology, which has been significantly affected by further French sentences, has not changed in terms of four centuries.
Trinidad, which was between the sea and the mountain massive Escambray, is a place so far as the art that was in the past 50th century, there was no way to connect this region to the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the side.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolate anything, everyone was pleased to have a tower over the head.
If there is more time in Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth to go to see interesting places around, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the valley of Sucreries.
Then, the evening, it's usually to go to the Music House who animates after the sun's bed and where the music is just at the morning.
Baracoa
Some design this bourgade to the extreme East of Cuba as the beautifulest in the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the way that leads to it.
The two roads from Guantánamo must be thrown from high and accidental mountains and run a landing almost without marks of the hum's activity.
UNESCO wrote East Cuba, thanks to its intact landing, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate, in the church, there is Christophe Colomb's cross (really, she has seen the day nearly 100 years after Colomb's period) and from the hill where the old chateau-fort and the current hotel El Castillo is held, there are several table mountains, with the most famous one is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rhum, cigarettes, mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Baiy of the Tropicana Island, the Cabaret of the Holy Patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the ancient servants, could be filled with a number of pages.
Just as we just say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the alliances are `effective, says the Americans
The lack of soldiers and needed equipment affects the United States' performance of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should take a specific plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not the same as it should, but the representatives of countries in Edinburgh in Ecosse agreed.
Along with the growing contest of the Taliban movement, the eight involved states today also discuss future plans and allies.
While the United States called this week by the Defence Minister Robert Gates to NATO's troops to a greater activity, Great Britain views as a priority the strengthening of the government of Afghanistan and the enhancement of development assistance.
"Evolution in Afghanistan is perceived, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start a new development of economy and security," the British Defence Minister of Browne said to the BBC chain.
Four-nex percent
The activity of the Afghanistan insured ones is the most intense data of the American Army in the past five years.
The number of violences has increased by 27 per cent in comparison to the past year, up to 60 per cent in the Province of Helmand, south of the country.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, with nearly one quarter in the south.
However, the United States have reached their absolute limits and in the organization and the equip of troops.
In particular, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghanistan troops.
"We should seriously consider concrete objectives for the future period, as well as how to reach them," said Gates.
The OTAN Jaap de Hoop Secretary-General has now had similar matters.
"I am not pleased with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have approximately 14 percent of the soldiers and the equipment we needed, and that's not enough," De Hoop said to the Agency Re′s at the end of the speakers with the Japanese Government in Tokyo that would last three days.
Who's Family
In the last months, there are also conflicts between the countries involved in the issue of whether all alliances actually make them all possible in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its employment.
"The Germans have a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are involved in areas where violence is a minimum, the needs of fighting which they are subjects are, therefore, not as strict as those in the South and East of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British Sun tabloid has qualified the German soldiers of persecutors this week.
"Afghanists covered: The Germans play, while our fighters," Sun wrote in a document completed by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild has passed to the contra-attaque by guarding the photo of a British troop at a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will be billion in 2009
The charge of a debt of the State exceeding 84,000 corones is covered by each Czech Republic.
The total debt has been mounted at the end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.
The Government had planned to employ 159,2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of the development of the economys of the best of the State budget, the Ministry reduced the amount of 152,8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is to the end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.
Thus, Pengt; in the nine months of this year he increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June, he decreased by 13,4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the debt of the State from the beginning of October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84.000 crowns is covered by each Czech Republic.
There were more than 111 billion crowns in the past year.
"For instance, it seems that, through a less important deficit planned for the next year, a billion crowns limit could be exceeded only in 2009.
The next year the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said Patria Finance David Marek's analyst for the iHNed.cz server.
The Next Finance Vladimir Pikor's analysis is similar: "The billion could be exceeded by the year 2009 current.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it appeared that political situation changed, that policy was ready to economy more, the date could be repeated in 2010.
But I haven't made this change," he said.
Debts grow
The State's debt constitutes the debt of the central government and is primarily generated by the accumulation of deficits of the State budget.
The State's debt is financed by goods of the treasury, rental, direct loans or for example by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The internal detention of the State has increased this year for 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt of the State has increased this year by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the State called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and since June, it decreased 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt requirement of the State has increased at 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased interannually from the first to the third half of 13 per cent, which is, given the current health of the economy, a very high number.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly generated by the rental titles where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be a matter to negotiate when the reform of retraits comes," Pikora commented.
Better than what we expected
This is the strategy for financing and management of State debt for 2007 that the Government had planned to empowere 159,2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, through the development of the economy of the best State budget, the Ministry reduced the amount of 152,8 billion crowns.
The sum is mainly constituted by the deficit of the State budget, which is evidently to reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of 91.3 billion initially planned crowns.
It is then the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, 13,3 billion crowns, the 10 billion for the payment of travels, the financing of staff rental credits for 43 billion currencies and the rebuilding of the European Investment Bank's loans to 1.8 billion currencies.
She compared today before a court in Khartoum for having appointed a peached orchard
The British teacher judged in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced on Thursday night by a court of Khartoum at 15 days of prison and on exil, indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of have left ≥ 6 to 7 years of age to give the name of Mahomet to a worm in peak while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was pausable with a pain of fucking shots.
This British institute of 54 years, depending on the University High School of Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday with her and committed to the Islam and meeting under article 125 of the Sudan Penal Code, following several complaints of parents with the Ministry of Education of Sudan.
The story is actually up in September, when this teacher asks for his age of 6/7 years to choose a name for the worms in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouth of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed”, says the director of Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children of 23 chose Mohamed as a preferred name.
Mohamed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Children then made a book for the class with the photo of the orchard followed by the “My name is Mohamed”.
The orchard himself did not carry any label with that name, but the problem is just the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslims of Giiyaan Gibbons, teacher in the same school in Sudan, pointed out that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insultant to a religious faith, "I am just sorry that she asked the children to vote for a name," it was only a "innocent error".
Opinion shared by many institutions who describe it as “very careful towards its Property” and “never speaking of religion in class”.
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, which is written in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by the Muslims is a way to honor the prophet (only given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a game?
Of course, this is a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiations meeting in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanian finished Thursday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without overcoming their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regretable that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status," said the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger during a conference of press in Vienna.
Remarking that peace in the region was "in game", his American approved, Frank Wisner, encouraged Pristina and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“We do not predict violence in the immediate time but we are going in a very difficult period”, he said, “becoming evident tensions”.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, who group the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last be held in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the nearly 90% province of Albanophones could become more when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will report their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika has been loaded from a new mediation by the United Nations to the last.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the freedom of independence in Kosovo to the Security Council, are insisting on a follow-up of negotiations beyond that date.
"Russian was and remained engaged in a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of Kosovo's Onusian administration, the ODAs believe that the EU's independentity is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to proclaim it in a single way if the Security Council does not take it in favour.
It insists on an accurate autonomy.
“Happy, no agreement has been found” announced by the President of the Kosovo autonomous authority, Fat_Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel, where these “latter chance negotiations were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, ancient commander of Cosovarian rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, was part of his regrets.
However, he said that the autonomy plan presented by ́rada “pertained to a past that led to murders and deportations”.
‘Domain Effect’
The Serbian President Boris Tadic, for its part, considered that a compromise was always intendable, maintaining the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a single-lateral announcement of the independence of the province.
In particular, it refers to a "domino effect" in a region still fragilized by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
“For Serbia,” he said, “it does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On March, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision returned to the Security Council, where its Russian Alliance has a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia” said the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“These negotiations have been last two years.
They must end as they started: to the Security Council."
For journalists, Fat日 Sedjiu had answered that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status”, which implies that any unilateral statement of independence from the albanophones would be “in concertation” with the O.O.A.
Bush brings an agreement between Israel and Palestinian
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference, by its care at Maryland, that the Israelites and the Palestinians were finally agreed on a common statement.
He pointed out that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were heard to immediately engage negotiations in order to find a definitive regulation of 60-year-old satisfaction between their two peoples.
In the presence of two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "pace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "the terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its colonisation activities, said Bush, reminding the two parties of their obligations in respect of the "Road Fee" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House emphasized that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, presidented by Abbas, would "conclude a peace Treaty that solve all issues in suspension, without exception, including central issues".
This call covers the three painful problems of the contentious heart between Israel and Palestinian: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the sort of Arabic rehearted from their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the conflict of 1948.
Following the statement after the American President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and deep" and that they refer to all aspects of a regulation, quoting "Jerusalem, re-resolutions, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
On its turn to the court, Olmert engaged in the future speakers to be "direct and continuous" and "a efforts to buckle them in the 2008 court".
Bush fixed at the end of 2008 the time to implement its "visibility of two Palestinian and Israeli states" which co-existent.
Saudi Arabia revealed that she had received a commitment in this sense of Bush before decided to participate in the conference.
The Arabia, whose participation in Polis is a success for Washington, is the origin of a plan, introduced by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its return from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including Jerusalem-East.
It marks "a carrier in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the racines of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saoud considers in his interview in the Arabic daily of Saudian capital.
The police are not responsible for seeking.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
Like each time in this type of fact, official versions and sounds are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the a?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the National Police Inspection (IGPN), a police car was on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-Bel.
“It was not in intervention but in patrol, and was at 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare” explains a police source.
A green motor of the Kawazaki mark, “not approved, therefore not authorised to guard on the road” (read below) and piloted by two youths without casks, was “very living around”.
“He won the police car on the left, after a priority to the right”, states a policeman.
The control of alcoholism on vehicle occupants was negative.
The state of the car (before defenced, star-brise, par-chocked) shows the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the research of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérere de Givry, announced to have granted an investigation for “involuntary homicide and non-aid to person in danger” to the IGPN, co-operating with the Departmental Guide of the Security of the Val-d'Oise.
On the afternoon, at the occasion of a press conference, the claim indicates that the IGPN investigation, at that stage, dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the a., hearing on Sunday evening, confirmed “the version of the police, meaning that this minimoto has reached relatively quickly on their left”.
Yesterday, a kind of rain, of course caused by the breaking of the roads on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained clothed as long as the car of the police was able to break.
The vehicles have been inserted and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsy yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a voice was quick in Villiers-le-Bel, which the police would have quickly left the places, not so helping both youths.
The IGPN, however, would also separate "all serious errors" on this point.
“It is an aspect of the more difficult investigation, which needs more research, on which it needs to be very responsible”, explained a police source.
Libération met a ocular witness of these few instants who followed it.
One of its windows give exactly on the scene.
“We have soon descended, with my cousin who is in the hospital, to try to randomize them, Ra’s witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw “a completely hazard policeman who was drinking.
Two others tried to reanimate one of the young ones, the fourth talked on the phone."
In view of the pressure that quickly surrounded the scene, and is it, of the certainty that the people in the unexpected situation of the young people had been brought to car by the stations arrived.
This testimony always comes to the desk "approximately twenty minutes after the police's department".
They also practiced heart massages in vain.
"I will not say that police services have not been helped to young people.
These youths have been secourus.
The pumpers arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them”, highlighted the search from her side.
The pressure ascends to Pakistan
The Pakistanian police repeated the first manifestations on Monday since the establishment of the emergency state two days ago by General Musharraf.
In Lahore, east of the country, approximately 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the emergency state were hurt by the lacrymogeneal graves used by order forces, witnesses.
The latests have been thrown by stones, hurting police.
At least 350 lawyers have been interpelled.
Similar scenarios like Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police were charged and wounded by lawyers.
Many would have been interplyed.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's Barrier called to a general greeve and announced manifestations, after a vacation of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, military human rights and lawyers.
The streets with access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent race.
Other manifestations would have occurred in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The movement of lawyers collected on Monday the support of the religious parties held in the powerful Muttahida-e-Amal covenant, which the Chairman urged the people to send flowers to judges who spoke against the emergency status and detrites to those who swore to Musharraf.
"The promise of Musharraf doesn't hold anymore"
The Supreme Pakistanian Court is directly referred to by the proclaimed exception measure Saturday evening.
It had to be declared in the next days on the reelectability of the Chairman on 6 October to the indirect suffrage of the President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was invented and replaced.
"All that we assist is illegal, anticonstitutional and contrary to the Court's judgments," said the judge in the journal The News.
The promise of Pervez Musharraf to leave the head of the army and to become a civil president 'not more' after the establishment of the emergency status, said on Monday, the Minister of the Tariq Azeem Information.

More than one third of the pregnancy remains unexpected
This calculation takes into account the undemanded pregnancy (24%) and the badly planned or unexpected birth.
Today, more than a pregnancy of three (36%) is not expected, a study conducted by the National Demography Institute (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuvirth law, which liberalized the contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account the undemanded pregnancy (24%) and the badly planned or unexpected birth.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates the Ined.
Liberalisation of the contraception has also been allowed to improve the 'found control', the institution notes that the rate of use of the pill among women from 20 to 44 years has passed from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight of the ten births would be well planned today.
See approximately for a couple of five and if possible at the early season, considered as the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular reparation on the space station
There will be more than seven hours of work in the astronaute Scott Parazynski and its international space station team friends (ISS) to perform the spectacular reparation of a sun panel, which is essential to follow the scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that accumulated records of its duration, its distance from the viable modules, from the speed with which it was imagined, of astronautes 'brickled' tools to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Wednesday while the astronautes had removed from the Discovery ship the Harmony module, a large cylindric room loaded to receive the European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a type of appointment chain for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to provide them in election.
The second task of the team was, therefore, to move a module for the production of election by solar panels weighting 17,5 tonnes, already present on the ISS to put it on its final position.
After moving it, the team started the reployment of the solar panels of the module with an envelope of 76 metres.
And that is where one of the panels, which spread up as awards, was damaged at nearly one meter by a cabble that fell down.
Deployment has been stopped so that the panel is not more damaging.
The astronautes, which originally perform a control output from the Discovery ship, then going to fix another solar panel with the rotation system was defective, seemed forced to dedicate themselves to the damageed panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to carcule at the end of the 30 meters length of the telecommanded arm of the ship to the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers of Nasa.
Great, resistant, very awesome, he has the very developed torse and long arms.
At 46 years, this training doctor was therefore loaded to "opera" the solar panel "injured".
After exhaust inspection of deficits, he separated the cash cab and installed types of "athle" in the damaged area.
It was helped by a second "spacewalker" staying near his own and, inside, by other astronautes, including Peggy Whitson, the commander of the team.
The tool that he used, an isolating mini-cane of hockey to avoid electricity on solar panels produced several hundreds of volts, was designed and "brickled" by the astronautes at the station board.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be completely exploded before making the inventory of its tools and reacting inside the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts benefited from a half day of detention before today, seven astronauts do not recover the Discovery ship for a return to the Planned Earth Thursday.
The title of EADS sanctioned in Bourse
The EADS action is currently low to Paris's beach, after the aircraft and defence group announced that it would have to expenditure between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to address the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Bourse.
The group was obliged to review its operational result forecast for 2007 after the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the in-ural flight of the plane.
The expenses for the delay taken in the delivery of military transport aircraft, announced in October, are '1.2 to 1.4 billion euros with more than 1 billion for Airbus', was announced by the European EADS manufacturer's mother house.
As a result of these charges, the EADS will be forced to announce new exploitation result objectives (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its next quarterly results, without further encrypted precisions.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new charges is consistent with six months late.
For a reminder, the operational result of EADS was 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to the delays of another programme, the very large porter A380.
Initially, the Group proposed a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension, on Sunday, at the outcome of the urnes: the Russians will choose massively for the party of President Poutine, United Russia.
Confirming their encouragement to stability, or even to the spirit, after a very locked campaign.
At three days of the islative elections, Russian President Vladimir Poutine addresses today the electors a television message on the chains, already stored, but whose content is stored secretly.
He makes it as a head of a Unified Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is announced incrediblely.
Yesterday, the President has not allowed it to transparency by receiving foreign ambassadors, who are pleased to deliver a new burden against the O.O. accused of entry - his predilection theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a real democracy and we want honest, most transparent and most openly elections," he said.
In the eyes of opposition, we're away from the account.
It describes a pressure campaign.
The leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there were "never had so sad elections, even in the time of Eltsine".
After the repression of the last weekend manifestations, Garry Kasparov's ex-champion of failing world, condemned to five days of prison for illegal manifestation, remains prohibited of visiting his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviet man"
After these unsuspened islatives, two more open questions are profiled:
- Who will happen in Poutine at the president?
The Official Journal held yesterday on 2 March 2008 the date of the Presidency's first tour; the candidates have to be informed until 23 December.
Elu in 2000 and re-evaluated in 2004, Vladimir Poutine may not be able to carry out a third consequent mandate.
Or none of the following guests are emerging.
- What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the majority of the parliamentary and all the powerful Russian party who would choose the Government and the Chairman?
Whatever it may be, in the islatives as the president, the power that comes out of triomphera.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet man, and they do not feel masters of their destination," estimates the socialist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
History Nikolai Kopossov, from the St. Petersbourg State University, returns far away: the civil society has delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the Community spirit has delayed the training of individualism.
According to the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine renewed with the model of a paternalist State, perfectly accepted by the population as far as this new patriarch has not been followed by terror, but by a certain economic aid," Mary Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation, states.
Today, the Russian "reject the personal responsibility" which they had shortly demonstrated after the URSS.
“What is good to think?”
The phenomena affects all social beds, including the world of business.
And the administrative elite aims to preserve the status quo: 65 Governors (of 85 of Russian leaders) lead the United Russian local lists.
The newly imported freedoms of O日 are often chaos synonyms, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of which the Russians will neither vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54 - year - old teacher: “What is good to think?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why to change them? ”
A memory weight
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which retract the destinations of 17,5 million of victims of the hitlerian regime, are free to access.
The 47 million archive documents contained at 27 km linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were only consultable for a "humanian" purpose, namely individually and nominatively on request of an ancient victim or his rights.
The eleven States supported their management - therefore Germany, France, Israel and the United States agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The ratification process of this Agreement has been completed by all States, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historicals to Bad Arolsen will allow research " in particular on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Cross-Rouge Committee (CCR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive character of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain deportation victims.
The records of the concentration camps or the arrest orders established by the Gestapo have been gathered after war in practice: to find the civilians who were exported or subject to the obligational work and, possibly, to bring them a evidence of their internal in order to open the road to their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent salaries are decades of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is a limited interest.
"There is nothing new to wait for these documents," said in 2006 Dr. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Research Centre on Antisimetics at the Technische University of Berlin.
EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, indo-European bilateral trade has already reached approximately 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the first commercial partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hoped to sign a free exchange agreement in 2008, indicated the European Commissioner in Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian approved, Kamal Nath.
The EU foreign ministers had last April given their green fire to the European Commission to engage negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian nations (Asean). The Indonesian bilateral trade has already reached about 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the first commercial partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the nineth EU trade partner, the numbers of the European Commission.
"A free exchange pact works largely with the two economys" and "Inde would improve its access to a market of 450 million promoted Europeans," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the ten first products exported by India, stated the European Commissioner. The Asian and European gentlemen exchange annually for "47 billion euros" and "10 billion euros of services", said this week, Daniele ́adja, head of the delegation of the European Commission to New Delhi, which regrets that the bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India are vended for their eighth diplomatic summa in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes attention to concerns by offering 10 billion books for five weeks
The British bank was concerned on Thursday to deal with the current return of anxieties on the credit conditions, and announced a ten billion library at the base rate of 5.75% of the five weeks, a duration of a period of time.
"In order to deal with concerns which the financial market conditions will be particularly covered at the end of the year, and to give banks a greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its provision of reserves provided during the maintenance period on 6 December in the form of an open market operation at five weeks," she points out in an appealed.
The bank indicates that 10 billion euros (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December to 12H15 GMT at the basis rate and up to 10 January.

These are normally on a week.
The BoE says in her owner that she "she's ready to take other measures to maintain the rate" of interbankary loans day-on-line with its basic rate.
The interbancation rate daily was 5.829% Thursday.
The rate of three months was 6.6%, one higher since September 18th.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the sea, the amounts marked by the Bank of England were assorted of a significant penalty rate that dismissed the banks to have recourse.
According to some sounds, corrupted by the evolution of the book course in relation to the euro, many have preferred to subscribe to the amounts marketed by the European Central Bank, to more beneficial rates and with a more safe discretion.
UMP and NC review the PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP groups and the New Centre held Thursday to discuss articles of the proposal of socialist law on purchasing power, which corresponds to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a "nick" socialist (the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined from a division of measures adopted on Monday by the PS national office, among which the increase of 50% of the employment premium, the recovery of the fleeting TIPP, a cheque-transport or a lodging framework.
UMP and NC voting against the review of articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was held at the outcome of the general debate, which sometimes occurred to trades, sometimes vifs, between majority and opposition at a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on the purchasing power.
The head of the PS members Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in form of amendments to the draft rectificative finance law reviewed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following many sounds about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelité, the promotor/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British Republic of Melvin Benn.
“For our business, it is an honour to work with a person who has, not least, inspired the current movement of the festivals in America”, said Charlie Jones of C3 at Billboard.com.
C3 produces the festival Lollapalooza of Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a steady destination for the camping.
The festival should hold from 8 to 10 to 10 on a private closure of 500 acres at about 40 minutes from Philadelité.
In the name of Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the reading Festival bar in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80 000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn took the Leeds Festival at his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Festival Latitude of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been loaded from the production, concession of licences and organizational tasks of Glastonbury Festival, which can now receive up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of the most inspiring event that he has never assisted, Charlie Jones de C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European event festival.
“We have chosen aeroplanes Philadelité as a market and work with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city of Philadelité”, supports Charlie Jones.
"We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiased by this project.
Unfortunately, we have been involved in politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
“Happy, we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are prepared to create a great festival on a exceptional site that will last serve the people of Philadelère.”
C3 Presents resuscitated the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park of Chicago, after being found in the festival landing in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded the respective brute income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the middle of the city.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a festival, while ours are located in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge the two formulas on the other hand to give both the impression of the festival to the European and city to the American."
Vineland is nearly halfway between Philadel et Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the master, supports the maintenance of this event with enthusiasm,” said Charlie Jones.
The last is to reveal the conditions of the hearing, but it states: "They are quite interesting to allow investment in such a event and to accept a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the ability to take this festival is "very large", as well as that of 80 000 people from Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were made to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of pressure.
"Vineland will be at rock salt, but music will be varied there, in the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the price Top India Promoter from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montréal faces the Terminator
It is not easy to draw Hollywood film tables in Montreal when no other than Terminator is opposed to it...
This mission of deduction is part of the delegated functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, declares the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the “Governator” patts?
"The industry is determining where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll go.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best”, he says.
The course to the festivals
However, the priority of Denis Turcotte is the promotion of the film here.
The course in Oscars has been started.
It will be from all the festivals of the West County, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, questioning to present the chebeco films, to evaluate them and to make sure the performers are interviewing.
Dark Age had a beautiful vitrine at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is at the office in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short meters to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end of the year in the bourgeois? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Not less than five weeks after the finishing of the exercise, investors are already striking their hands by expecting the traditional end-year rally array.
However, this year experts are not even sure that this will happen.
Banif believes "of the statistical point of view, a positive behaviour in December.
However, it is not necessary to provide statistical provisions, since, given the current context, uncertainty looks at markets at at least on the short term. "
Although they are not partisans to take the bourgeois in the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the bulb market feeds through the existence of liquidity, intended to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the efficacy of escape to quality values both in the long periods and in the short periods".
For this reason, they believe that the bourgeois will have a behavior rather sideless, unless volatilities "softly because we do not know the impact of the low rate of the Fed, given the high level of the brute and the risk of stimulating inflationist pressures"
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI wins in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rail.
"This is not the best thing," the expert assures.
Ibex, the Spanish boursier, has lost nearly 4% since 8 November when the closure has been closed at 15.945,7 points.
However, not all experts have this view so negative.
Juan Solana, Analysis of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolio and traditional contributions to the retraite regimes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert needs that things will be a little different this year, since he believes that the rally will occur from the second week of December, after the festival of the Constitution (6 December).
The analysis does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, Analysis of Inversis Banco, assesses that we are nearly technical levels and that we can see a rebuilding of the index that could be caused depending on information from the European Union on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysers agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum cottons.
Solana, of Intermoney, states that "the great values of this year are returning to him."
The expert would include the two large banks and some builders "for when the date comes, the electrical sector will be very dear."
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, the increases will be from the bank and the industry.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rail, in the case they put it.
"ACP has received positions for several months and we hope that other constructors such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same way," explains the expert.
The cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to winning in Christmas winning season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the companies will do it very well, although there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
○ In the last seven years, only for two occasions in December was a lower month.
The authentic end-year railing occurred in 2003, during which the bullshire markets were out of the crisis caused by the perceiving of the bullet.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the December month has increased 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consequent year of wins (for the time Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it is successful to computers on its end of the year.
The Popular Bank will open 200 open offices 12 hours from Monday on Saturday
The Popular Bank decided to renew a large number of its offices.
Total 200 banks are in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These contributors, which will work under the Popular Max Mark, represent a large change for the bank.
So for the rest of the Spanish bodies, since it was the first group who decided to start to partake of the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20:30, and to open the Saturday from 10 to 20:30.
Another group who has also repeated several times that he wants to enhance the times of his subsidiaries, BBVA, even though he has not yet decided to do the first step.
It is to conclude an agreement with the syndicates to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening a afternoon but not to the public.
The results of the Experience of the People's Bank will be crucial to associate other bodies with this initiative that coincide with trade times.
This is exactly the aim that the Popular Bank seeks.
Draw autonomous customers in these areas to purchase their purchases in SMEs and the road trades selected to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 implanted agencies throughout Spain in approximately 18 months, because it is not the opening of new agencies but the renewal of existing agencies.
For this reason, the emos will modernize the sugars he already has in the trade areas, adapting them to the profile of customers from different streets.
In this way, the enhancement of timers is associated with a different design from within the sugar and a new design, more currently, with higher colors.
Angel Rivera, the bank trade responsibility, ensures that this renewal does not involve large investments, but the staff employment, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, who will also have spaces in order to meet SMEs there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience was positive, as explains Angel Rivero.
The streets of Murillo Brave, O'Don日 and the Gran Via of Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently, Rivero.
The Popular Bank has currently 2.500 contributions.
And 60 others who work under the brand of Monocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very deep hours, who even open on Sunday and Fridays.
In these PopularMax agencies, they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a large amount of non-financial products for their sale.
'We don't want to competite our customers,' comments Rivero.
For the moment, they arrived in an agreement with Telefonica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.
Double Telecinco for the first time the value in Bourse of its Rival Antena 3
We arrived there.
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, a delegated adviser of Telecinco, expressed its satisfaction yesterday at the conclusion of the Bursian market, when he found that the string he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A unique aspect of his joy was: 'this is not the fact that we have increased, but we have been less decreased', he said.
However, he focused on the fact that on a low market, 'We have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended yesterday with 2.54% progress.
This gain stabilised its loss of 15,66 % since a year.
The value in Bourse of the undertaking controlled by Mediaset (52% of the capital) and year-based by Vocento (13% additional) is thus reached by 4.488.88 million euros, Bloomberg data.
Antena's rival 3, which has lost 1.52% yesterday and has reached a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half 2,193,46 million.
The value of other communication companies covered in Bourse is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million in Prisa (Finco Days editor) and 1.779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is the fact that we speak of two similar companies.
The related fact represents what we are able to do on the same market to what price and how we rent it in terms of audience. '
Telecinco announced the last week that he intended to be the first television chain this year to exceed the 1,000 million brutal advertising incomes, as Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated adviser of Telecinco and Publiespanya, the branch that manages the group's publicity.
In order to be real to this year's data, the television chain should register an increase of 3.6% in its public facturation in 2006 by 965.4 million.
In its part, the pure Antenna 3 calculation increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach ≥4.4 million), while the net television income increased by 0.7% (63.4 million).
One of the factors indicated by the analystes for the best relative development of Telecinco in Bourse is the important payment out that he has maintained until now: in 2006, the company presided by Alejandro Echevarria distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is soon to make a decision, this could vary after the purchasing of 33% of Endemol and with Mediaset.
' We have the official commitment to give for at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analystes, the market presents signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of benefits in Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and 2009, to 7%.
This is due, explaining, to the decrease of the estimated growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same undertaking reduced the estimation of winnings from 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

The Congress approves the transfer of Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
Parallelly to its parliamentary formality, which has ended today with the vote of the Congress of the amendments to the draft Senat, the Government has submitted to an audience the regulation that will develop the new law, with a view to its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to demonstrate the efforts made by the Members and Senators to negotiate and maintain the best regulations to ensure the protection of investors and to detailly regulate the activities of the agencies in order to effectively work markets.
Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, involves modernization of the financial markets, while strengthening the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the National Value Market Commission leaders (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial consultation services to be provided for for socially specialized reasons as well as for individuals or legally and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultation companies (AFI), which join value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
Furthermore, it increases the number of financial instrument operational systems in order to enable regulated secondary markets to deal with multilateral negotiation systems and order internationalisation systems, which lead to competition with the current bus managers.
The Law also requires investment services undertakings to provide on the market information on the key aspects of its business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to maintain a record of all their operations to facilitate the control of the CNCMV.
As a result of the Congress Economy Commission, several amendments have been made, including one that shows that the holding debts will be considered as a "complex financial instrument" given its high risk for the investor, which has demonstrated what has happened with the US high-risic hypothetic debt (subpression).
Moreover, they benefited from the transfer of the direction to delimiter the functions of the Economy diplomatics may be 30 years after approving in 1977, the royal decree which delimits the professional functions reserved to the economy.

The harmonised consumption price increases from five decades in November, up to 4,1 %
This indicator, which serves after Eurostat to include it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance on the development of prices in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the Eurostat policy and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing comparable data in the time and quality of those produced in the United States.
The advanced operator is calculated by using the same procedure as the employed for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelisation methods to estimate the information that is not yet available for the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced operator is only indicative because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be opened on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, claimed that 4.1% of the IPC was a "time number" in November, but at the same time he foretold that the price will continue on "relatedly high" levels in the coming months.
In all cases, Solbes has stated in the Congress curves that "the number is not good" the difference between Spain's inflation on the monetary union continues to be "more or less" as the last years.
He also explained that in November, "There was less surprise" than during the months when the Government did not face such a high growth.
"We hope a number of approximately 4%," recognized the Minister for Economics in relation to the current year.

Northern Rock's deposits have fallen up to more than 50% to 12.000 million books (16.800 million euros) since he has entered into crisis in the middle of September and has had to have an emerging credit to the England bank.
At this time, he collected a few records of more than 25,000 million books, a number gradually fallen within two months and half because of its customers' failure and despite the guarantee of 100% of the money that the Government offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.

The Major of Totana was arrested for a presumed city corruption tragedy
The Civil Guard today has arrested the current major of the Totana's people's community (popularity) in the early morning because of its sustained relationship with the city corruption trame covered this week.
Furthermore, one of the secretaries of the municipal Council and the police officer of the municipality was also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me in May, Juan Morales, current member of the right, and until then the municipal adviser of the Major, and who is the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the "minder" of this trame.
Agencies continue to promote the municipality and the Urbanism Council, and the possibility of new detentions will not be discarded in the next hours.
Moreover, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspicious of the urban corruption trame, covered at the beginning of this week, was imputed.
As indiced yesterday by the SER Chain to the lawyer of the "popularity party" of Juan Morales, it was arrested by exiting Morales' home with the important documentation in its possession of trame.
Moreover, from the sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the pre-consumed committees of Morales in exchange of facilitating the signature of a city agreement with a building company of the Galice to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight prisoners.
Bono agrees to be at the candidature of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo and to preside the Congress if they won elections
The former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the case where socialists will win the general elections.
Thus, the Secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that was held at the federal seat of this party with Zapatero this midnight.
The Chief of Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "the best" in political life is "the best".
Moreover, he stressed that "yes it" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside the Congress if the socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congrès, who last 15 November made its decision to not present the next general elections and to abandon its political career to devote the fight against climate change in the university.
The former Minister recognized that the President of the Government did not stop insisting that he would return to the political forward since he left it two years ago.
Moreover, he noted that, even though citizens already know who will be the economic President if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the President of the Congress in a "transparency Act".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the Room into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and to "remember more to the citizens".
"It is sometimes lamentable that the only local in Madrid where you can't speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the president of the Government in Senat has been interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he had words of appreciation for his current president, Manuel Marín and "he knows how to do" and he did not want to do as if he had already occupied his job to not fall, as he noted, in what his opposers could be viewed as "a domination".
A climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to a perseverance without mercy, the skeptics of its predictions as well as those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
Moreover, it is the case for a leader of the movement that is president of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than the islamic terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach is obliged to explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government, has contributed decisively to Spain's head of the European Union in the non-execution of Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it has been produced and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Moreover, it must explain to the Spanish what measures he will take to free the climate change.
What enterprises will be affected, what habits of citizens will be changed, what individual and collective energy economy will be required to do, what economic consequences it will cause.
That's what's going to sacrifice and pay to save the planet.
But there was no, and there will be no explanations.
Exactly because it is to sacrifice and pay.
The measures against climate change, real measures, are improper.
Co-operative, inconfortable and threatening for business accounts and individuals.
Until the center of the absence proposed by the Spanish socialist party, he seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he was imprisoned.
It is to say that it is to save the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
It has statements that have effect, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for electoral campaigns that are not speaking, who don't declare and who doesn't require, embellies the meetings and inspires the tenderness.
In fact, it is limited to be a purely contracting party and that does not predict that we move to bicycle or refresh us with the event.
The Major and Chief of the Local Police of Totana arrested for a presumed tragedy of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmery arrested the Master of Totana's Murcian locality, the "agent" José Martínez Andreo, the leader of the local police, the secretary of the Marie and a suspicious hotel undertaking for possible urban crimes, reported today the sources of the investigation.
The municipal adviser was arrested at his home and was brought to the city hotel, where many agents at this time met, who also presented themselves to the Urbanism municipal advisory function and to the municipal company for the management of the Industrial Sol and the Location.
These three decrees are held at the last six detentions of Monday in the provinces of Galice, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation on the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Gallian company Nuaria could build 4000 apartments after paying illegal committees during the last issuing.
Moreover, two other persons have not been arrested but are imputed in the Judicial Question, which the Court of Justice of Totana has trained.
The first six prisoners have passed to a legal provision today.
According to the sources, the municipal adviser of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentary of the PP party, Juan Morales, is addressed by the investigation.
Moreover, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, has been imposed, as well as the current trusted of the former municipal adviser, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, the Nuaria Group Agency, and through which pot-de-vins would have been performed.
The survey is charged by the UCO of the Operative Central Unit of the Gendarmery Group, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, have practiced eleven inspections, the majority of prisoners and prisoners in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was therefore arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a very known bird-product company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediate.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing the largest residential complex of Totana, which would include the construction of more than 5.000 apartments, a golf area and two hotels with "spa".
The company gained 2,2 million square metres of land which were requalified and its project would have to double the population of the commune, which currently counts 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is a company such as Autesa and Inomonuar, who care for immobile promotion; Conycase, managing Vigo parkings in the Coruña Streets, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Catholico; Hogartel, who cares for direct marketing; Preconiza, which is on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

An eyegue provides information on the introduction into the Penal Code of Crime on Downloads on the Internet:
A. Download of a song would be a passive crime of a penalty of six months to one year.
However, the flight in a CD magazine for a value less than EUR 400 is considered as a mistake (Article 623.1).
B. The flight in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than the charged for download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and make it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than the charged for download (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a baggage than to participate in the compressed disk traffic.
Participation in a tumultuous bathroom includes a penalty of three months a year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would include a penalty of six months to two years

My traitor's doctor told me one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'The money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less '.
I mean, the feelings that generate the monthly payment of workers depend on what the workers win.
The study has been performed through tomographic magnetic reasons at the University of Bonn, and the results are included in the last number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the student and director of the group loaded neurocognition images of the Life &Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant answered correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers noted that when the two people realized that they received the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has continued eight years of implacation of the Balkan wars since the Pénal Tribunal's Public Ministry for Ex-Yugoslavia, which is located in Haye.
His mandate is completed at the end of the year and Carla will go with a go' amer, because the main responsible for the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8.000 Bosnian muslims are dead - the ex-general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic are still in freedom.
Their names are listed in the documentary of the Swiss realiser Marcel Schüpbach, the list of Carla ' (2006, unprojected in Spain), with the rythme of a police thriller, following the work of the Swiss prosecutor of New York who continues to flee and presses the governments involved to retreat the circle.
What assurance do I have?
The car insurance, covering the driver with potential insufficients, includes an important expenditure that will depend on various factors such as age, sex, olderness of the licence of conduct, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use, among other things.
Having a car is the main one.
And it is that, choosing the suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, choosing the appropriate car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This commitment is materialized by an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the granted premium and in exchange becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in case of injury.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, olderness of the authorisation of conduct, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use, inter alia.
Insurance companies set their prices depending on statistics, in order to increase the probability of a accident is higher, more the cost to pay is higher.
That is why people of more than 25 years and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower deficiency rate than their understanding.
Similarly, using recensements, companies concluded that married persons have a tendency to have less than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, so the probability of an accident.
Increasing frequency, probabilities increase.
They are many of the variables that the insurers take into account at the time of establishing the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must well study the situation to choose the car insurance that is best adapted to his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables at the time of choosing one or other type of assurance, so that, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, it offers him a reasonable price.
Youths of less than 25 years have to face various inconvenients in the time of a contract with a assurance to a accessible price, as it may be the low experience in conducting and the extent of conduct permit.
Although the idea to be well assurance is any risk, there are other economically more options.
The most preliminary drivers can choose to ensure any risk with franchise, so that they get the coverages of any risk insurance but to a more accessible price.
This form of convention involves that the customer pays a part of the amount of deficiency.
"The part of the amount of the injury the customer will be established depending on the value of the premium, which will be higher than the amount will be low," speculates Luis Noguera, the responsibility in Spain of First Europe, the mediator of online insurance.
Another option is the enlargement of third-country insurance, so that the customer provides protection to face damage caused to third-party, but for those caused by his own car.
Furthermore, it would be covered against flight, fires and loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are less than 25 years trying to be disappointed and avoid injury as soon as possible, because it will affect bonification, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonification is a reduction in the basic tariff of the company.
In contrast, a sanction is a majoration of the basic tariff.
"The bonifications and sanctions will depend on the company and benefit of it.
If the company has been a good year, it will be able to allow the bonifications ", explains Noguera.
For more than 25 years, it becomes easier for the drivers at the time of a contract with a assurance, since the deficiency rate is reduced by the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose any risk insurance with franchise.
"Young people are usually not able to benefit from the experience of the pre-acquired experience after an accident," assures the director of the European Company in Spain and ensures that most accidents occur during the second year of conduct, once the ' fear of no'.
However, if the client is married but has not yet children, it is preferable that he negotiate any risk insurance, since his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered as persons with the lower deficiency rate, because majorities will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an insurance of any risk with franchise (which may be EUR 300), or an extended insurance for third-year-old vehicle when the insurance has a high level of bonification.
"They have a more distracted conduct and have a greater purchase power to allow them to take a more important amount of franchise," Judge Luis Noguera.
For retirements an insurance of any risk with freshness is preferable (which is 150 euros) or an extensive insurance for third parties when the insurer has a high level of bonification.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver with potential disturbances, but also because it represents an important expenditure, it is therefore necessary to study the assurance that we are most appropriate to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth end
Milanō and Celtic Glasgow are measured next Tuesday in San Siro to search for the point they miss to reach their respective objectives in the closer of the Champions Ligue, since it serves the Italians first and the Scotch to classify themselves.
The Italians are totaling ten points and have already been qualified during the fifth day by a no match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and receives Benfai who has four, does not pass for him.
These two matches of the Group D will be played a week before the sixth day ends, since Milan shall dispute the semi-finals of the World Clubs Cope in Japan at the end of December 13 of this month in searching for a place for the end of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the nul match at the stage Giuseppe Meazza → be the most expected result, although the two teams are trying to go out victorious, since the Italians will not want to spy with them and Celtic Glasgow know that by winning he would remain first and would ensure a better crossing in the eighth end.
A defect of Gordon Strachan team could be sufficient to classize if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it will not only be able to computer on it because with nine points the game returns to the Ucraine, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct dual.
Thus, the Millenniums are trying to empower the evening to the Scotland, who have a good hope to classify for the eighth end for the second time in the League Champions, after being held during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the prolongations (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the "rossoneri" the triomph would only return to Shakhtar, where Celtic would lose, to classify for the eighth end to continue the liga of the EUFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although it is the last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people assisted in Vancouver at the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
Spice Girls started in Vancouver (Canada), before approximately 200,000 spectators, their first turn since the group was dissolved in 2000.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) have stated a little while before starting their concert at the GM Place of Vancouver stage that the group meeting is 'brillant'.
Approximately 20,000 people have puzzled the tickets to attend the concert that had made a video in which the story of the group has become angry at the end of 1990.
The global meeting and tournament coincide with the launch of a new album that represents their main success and two new songs, ' Headlines ' and ' Voodoo ', which EMI's in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are ascended on scene by showing the bracelets that Posh Spice's wife had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The sport was in the public who filled the GM Place, even if Victoria had prohibited it a few days ago.
Before the spectacle begins, Victoria Beckham noticed that the British footballer had not seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the spectacle.
'Sporty Spice ' who was part of the group in 1998 ' due to differences between us ' and who caused the two-year dilution of the group, also expressed its nervousness during the interview with the press, two hours before the spectacle beginning.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feeling changed, the feeling of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad to have made a decision," Chisholm said on the meeting of the group she had solved nine years ago.
The song also noted that with time, "the things have been arranged and that we appreciate a lot."
But many things have changed since Spice Girl has shown up for the last time in 1998.
To start, CTV TV, the group arrived to Vancouver in a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby-seat army waited for them.
They count to her five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be held in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
They will be presented in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is casting the alarma.
A dispute on the price of gas is between Ukraine and Russia, which thus increases the risk of impact on the exports of fire to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.S.) are transferred by gasoducs, and each carrier is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fire, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, a change between both had caused a decrease in supply to the countries of the U.S.
The last conflict between Kiev and Moscow occurs after Ukrainian Government and Gazprom, Russian ownership monopol company, who has tried to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided for Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices to Ukraine by accepting payment for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from Turkmenistan neighbor.
The analystes said that this would lead to Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the import costs from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, reminding us that we are a country through which most of the gas transites,” announced the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy, Anatoly Kinkh at the Press Agency.
"The gas cost fluctuation would certainly be related to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) through Ukraine"
The last large change between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom supply for Ukraine.
This led to the loss of exports to Western Europe, which resulted in increased prices.
The Russian gas is a quarter of the provisions of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still developed.
As a result, Gazprom completed its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other countries from the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health ' must control its foreign employees'.
The Swiss Health Ministry must improve controls on its extra-Community employees to verify whether they have penalty, stated the Control Committee.
The warning of the General Reviewer, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at the Glasgow Airport of June.
Moreover, Mr. Black expressed anxiety about the fact that the Swiss Health Ministry has no specific data on the number of persons outside the sea.
The report also included other decisive controls, correctly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The General Reviewer carried out controls on the extra Community staff following the attack of the Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, Iraqian in the service of the Royal Alexandra of Paisley Hostel, was arrested at the airport after he had found with his jeep at the gates of the main terminal.
It was part of the three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October, because they were suspicious of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health must carry out prior employment controls on the overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences and work allowance for the United Kingdom.
Although the Swiss Health Ministry uses the Swiss Disclosure to carry out criminal controls, the Agency does not have the right to make such information outside the Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the report of the General Reviewer now states that the committees are committed to the Criminal Control Bureau, which allows employees to carry out controls on various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some information on staff has been well verified, this is not done at every time."
Mr. Black stated that the Swiss Health Ministry performs most of the pre-employment controls he himself, but he also said: "Our report draws attention to the aspects in which the system can be improved in order to ensure that appropriate information on some members of the external staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Ecosse, said that it is " extremely improbable" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could do future terrorist acts.
He stated, "the report suggests that pre-employment checks currently work well in the Swiss health system and that it is uncertain that these warnings can bring some value."
The Swiss health authorities declared employing 1161 persons outside the sea, constituted for most doctors and agencies.
However, the General Reviewer stressed that these numbers must certainly be increased, in part because of the problems relating to identifying the members of undetermined contracting staff, which could be able to choose or not to remain in our country.
The investigation showed that the current procedures for health controls in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glassgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are actually suitable.
These checks are carried out on passport, work permits and qualifications.
The Swiss Government currently revises its policy and its employment pre-employment control system for the members of the outside ocean health services.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was enthusiast to perform this work after the terrorist attack at the Glasgow airport."
It said that the Swiss Government associated with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report that should be held in the next month, and would commit to better implementation of recently updated pre-employment checks and valid for all employees, including outside-sea persons.

The Government requested the Church to make more contrary to the Saudians in Iraq to join Al Qaeda soldiers fighting the Allied Forces and the Muslim Shit Government associated with the United States as a heritage, considered the hard line of the Sunny Saudians.
Al Qaeda's soldiers think that in Saudi Arabia, many clesiasts have been with the authorities to support the rule of the king's family policy governing the government.
The soldiers, encouraged by the calls against the Saudi Government pro oʹ, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudit origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government immobilies and energy supply sites.
Great efforts have been made by armed forces during the last five months” said the door of the Minister of State at the door of the state television.
Among the prisoners, 16 members of the Media are organized in a "mediat cell" aimed at promoting "takfiri" thoughts, the Sunni Muslim radical ideaology, which supports the relief to violence against confidential and apostled muslims.
Among the prisoners, 32 people are accused of subventing soldiers.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists yesterday said that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
The data issued from the European ship in orbits have shown that the planet is probably two times smaller than the Earth, in contrast to what it was thought before.
Venus is the nearest planet of Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that there were billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could even have been resident.
But the severe effect resulted from carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiations associated with a slower rotation led Venus to any other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is private of water, is devastated by uragans and light storms and has a quite hot surface of temperature to blow it down.
The covered Venus Express, the survey of the European Space Agency, who studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to the disasters of climate changes.
The Professor of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We begin to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from the earth, although the planets in them are practically similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario which has been billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, even with a resident surface."
From time to time enriched by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently from the ura, was secure by the Czechoslovakian police and Hungarian police yesterday.
A policeman said that three persons were arrested and that material is currently analysed.
He did not confirm that it was good for ur·, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (480,000).
Open Encore to All
Mitt Romney said not to be as candidate to the presidency to answer the questions of a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidates at the presidency finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many electors who have registered their issues submit them to candidates.
Wednesday, 28 November, no of the issues were as ridiculous as the issue of another debate from You Tube, when a good snowman asked the democrats their position in relation to the heating of the planet.
However, this time, the questions and answers reflected very much the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate to the next elections.
We do not know what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsorized the debate, have chosen You Tube's clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest of one subject, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN requested some electors to phone when they would hear pleasant things: The region has highlighted approval increases when candidates were expressed in a gross way.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is head of the major predicted elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to emphasize the fact that he was appealing to the clandestine immigration during his Major mandate in New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, the former ruler of Massachusetts, to employ clandest immigrants with him.
The two fighters became particularly fervents when they asked them whether they would be ready to promote a "amnesia" (for the clandests a regular status and the opportunity to become citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressist, have succeeded to deepen this subject.
No one of them has the opportunity to be chosen, but both remain in the course, it may be because they began to fight immigration before and more incisively than others.
Generally, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same opinions: stronger borders, and zero tolerance for clandest immigrants.
This subject, associated with concerns in particular by the case of toxic games produced in China, or many other fears for the outer world, promotes the Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between libertaries and Catholic conservators.
However, the debate has become particularly disappointing when other subjects have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for arms control.
John McCain and Mr. Romney have discussed whether to put water into the nose as a torture.
One of the participants asked whether the candidates believed in the whole of it, in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to say that the Bible is his preferred book, even though he is not sure to believe in the story of Jonas and the whale.
Another interventor asked whether Jesus would have been for the punishment of death.
We did not look at Mike Huckabee - in pool position in Iowa at a recent choice, thanks to his long-term Christian conservacy - to say that death punishment is painful as necessary.
When we insisted to know whether Jesus would be in favour, he laughed and said that Jesus was too young to present himself to the elections.
The hum's race remains insolutely open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's rebound in Iowa coincide with the recent wonderful surveys of subventions conducted by the libertary Ron Paul, as well as the suggestions during the breakfast debate.
These two are dismissed by the fact that the two protected parties cannot agree to decide who is the most known and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party of good hour and convincedly through a message of success on the American size that thus refers to leaders.
This time, the party is divorced and the result is far from being.
The pains of the Worklists
Gordon Brown had covered a new wheel in which he had been shaken; even if he had left, the situation would not change.
In view of the trends of the British scandal, this is not particularly fair.
No sales of coverages, nor hotel factors of Paris politicians, nor success extra spouse feet.
But there is a revelation that a rich businessman would have hidden for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Worklist Party, equivalent to more than $650,000 ($3m), that the party would not have said: A new battle with Gordon Brown would have been done well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister went back in his election project, insulting the British intellectual proclaiming that the opinion investigations did not affect its decision, and that he would expect to offer a comprehensive and effective government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the democrate liberal leader, said that Mr. Brown was transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's racket, a difficult bank at the crack border, has shown a failure of directives and a middle trial in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change of tax code have caused the coalition of industrial groups against the Government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative board.
A trio of generals at the retirement has launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reductions of military expenditure: they have declared that the Defence Minister is a part-time employment for them.
Currently, the suspicion of David Abrahams' disgusting gifts; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Worklists (and his former leader of vigilance) made them to leave.
Nothing of this means that Mr Brown goes to the output.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to rule.
People do not love politicians, and they do not trust them, but generally leave their doubts on their part when a new government comes to power.
It is obvious that a Prime Minister cannot improve the things for a long time, while he risks suspension: the administration is not working anymore; the ministers' cabinets make the balance; the press search for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because contrary to other political leaders, it cannot be able to be a starter.
Although he wanted to revoke Tony Blair, he also was his superior tenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are linked to Mr Brown's decisions when he was a chancer of the British treasure.
And even if it is not directly involved in the disasters of Blair, such as the long investigation on the funds of the party "Financiers accounting for the members of the House of Lords", the electors could think the contrary.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she looks like it.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party believe it.
Like in Mr. Bean, there is no victims or scratch.
And the medicine, although painful, could be to concrete the stalinian trends of Mr Brown forever, for a reliable and brutal government.
The new scenario on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular person who compares his donations to charity, said that he did not want any benefit of his benefit.
He may have his opinion, but he doesn't decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the large political subsidiaries are dealt with, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said to be the courant of Mr. Abrahams' programmes, without knowing that it was illegal, should therefore be asked, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, responsible for the collection of subsidies that had spoken of doubtful donations in October.
But until now Mr Brown is not involved: Nothing allows to think that he has been at the core of these steps, even though most of the payments had been made after his arrival to the Government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned the failure of his party, but he did not take attention to the fact that the decision authority is based on something he knows well, to make a investigation committee on this subject composed of a episode to the retirement and a judge.
In this case, lessons to be difficult are.
And if the law has been bafooded, it's the state of the police.
Moreover, there are many other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent president for the independent Committee on the Standards of Life for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financial reform of political parties.
This would oblige the Worklist Party, at a time of weakness, to guard with the Tories, which could bring him to rejection of its special financial report with the conferences; shortly, an amazing pill for a partner like Mr Brown.
But it should face some partisan facts.
The part of the conservators now has a good advantage for elections; it has two years to recover the electors, and the only way to win is to demonstrate unreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Card scanners.
Should the hypothics crisis be the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it's normal to see shots expected, tourbilloon around.
Now that the American Immobiliary Market crosses a critical phase, the preachers refer to the US credit card market.
The Goldman Sachs analysts believe that losses related to credit cards could reach $99 billion if the county is a hypothec to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of pressure are extremely significant.
There are increases in the cost and insolvency rates, which measure the parts of the non-recoverable balance or which are, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced the last month that he took 1.4 billion dollars in its credits to the consumer, in part because of the weakness of card porters.
It's the same thing too early to panic.
The costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the rate of insolvency of 3.89% of the third quarter is nearly a point compared to its historical average.
The detection of rates is partly explainable by technical factors.
A change in laws in the United States in 2005, with regard to the personal bankroute, caused a fracture of bankroute archives, which, in its turn, caused severe losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the loans conditions were to empire.
In addition, the industry announces fixed payment rates, which emphasize the monthly deduction sum that consumers must regulate.
and confidence in the capital security of credit cards is quite strong despite the paralyzation of other aspects of the funding.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, suggested that the emission volume for 2007 would be more than 25% than last year.
The direct infection links between the hypothec crisis and the credit card market are certain: consumers could prefer to deploy their endings now that equitable immobiliary loans have disappeared.
But card emissioners make more attention to the flow of species rather than to the value of the inheritance, and thus the fall of the prices of the immobile has not necessarily caused a change in the creditability of emprunters.
They could even offer advantages to credit credit issuers.
Consumers' premiums for the payment of hypotheques fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; thus the credit card depreciation would become a priority to repay all.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than hypothiaries and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or change credit limits.
This should in theory decrease the risk of a quick re-repeatment of action.
“We will not wake up a morning and re-evaluate all loans.” Gary Perlin, Capital One director.
If a financial disaster on the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk to have a consequent decrease.
If the lower prices of the real estate and a contract on the credit market lead America to recession, the industry must certainly face a macabral future.
Take care of the backsheet.
British bans are guilty for the Enron case.
The three British banks that would go to testify their roles in a fraud committed by the Enron Financial Director, Mr. Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement on midnight.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were awarded by innocent statements of the seven presumed fraud in 2000, made by Fastow in a secret financial scratch to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They should be presented to the Court in January.
But during an audience presided by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all claimed that they had committed a fraud.
The three former frameworks of Greenwich NatWest, a branch of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous everywhere in Greenwich NatWest because of extraditional procedures which have last two years.
In the United States, their case remains still a question in suspension for this investigation after Enron's fall in 2001.
The implications involved in 2002 made Fastow understand that it was the subject of the government's investigation in Enron's destruction.
The bans, called "three of Natwest", said to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a branch of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the scenario of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to call the bankroot procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the branch as null, but the three British people already know their value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the branch bank for 1 million £.
The banks paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million at Greenwich NatWest for its actions in the branch.
But actually these $20 million have gone into the britain banks, Fastow and others.
According to the reports, the banks would have obtained $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty of his active role in two conspirations in Enron's debt.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year prison in a federal prison in Louisiane.
Kopper is in prison for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released after payment of $1 million, which forces them to live in the United States during the trial.
In the previous seventh largest national society, on a bankroute in December 2001 after years of accounting calls, could not hide billions of billions of billion or even offer bidon speculations as profitable.
The discharge has caused thousands of licences, more than $60 billion loss of market value and more than $2 billion loss for travel plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former President-General Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for their implication in the creation of society.
Skilling was sentenced for more than 24 years of prison.
Conspiration, fraud and other crimes have been in vain because of his death due to a heart crisis last year.
Not under, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and had a sufficient fuel autonomy to flight out of Moscou in Los Angeles, part of $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russian people.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Although no one really needs so many seats since it is more than a family aircraft or the President of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the stand of Gulfstream, last Friday, at the Millions Room, an incentive for consumption for four days, which remains in a huge center of exposure around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoped to increase the interest of the new Russian riches for their different products, going from yachts in appeal to the cars filled with diamants like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer examined an oral porsche, exposed to his stand.
"It's a beautiful car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
“ Thanks to a oil boom, the Russian capital rolling in the black gold, like Dallas »
“We have the same thing in the years of 1890, when some Americans became so rich and were shiped in Europe where they were considered materialists, ” said Marshall Goldman, an elder of the Department Davis of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudians in the 1970s, Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are like the largest world expenditure.
The biggest luxe marks are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxe industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxe goods to markets such as Russia.
(The Conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times company.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars worth $282 billion, a list of Forbes numbering the most rich people.
Furthermore, two thirds of the rich are consistent of 103,000 billion Russian billion worth totally $670 billion, a study on the development of personal riches in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economys from the Centre of Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005 15.8% of the Russians live under poverty level).
“ There are hundreds of millions in Moscou, so we are all there, ” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London biutier.
She participated in the room for the first time in association with the Russian distributor, the Soho Biutier Group.
“ Women are all well prepared, and men worth a strength. ”
Going to the room on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 say that they are as their clients, millionary.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, Mercedes and the Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who entered his high-coated clothes like a red cup veteran like Joan Rivers.
The room is first shown to the new rich, the type of Russian brands buyers prepared to make the chew in the bottles to come to a large entertainment where they are exposed to Cadillac Escalades, platinium canvas, Mövenpick ice, customized billion tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund.
The public could buy tickets for EUR 30 ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in definiting the most dear and best marks," said Mr. Gijrath, putting proudly sitting at the Royal Carrier Manufacturer of Holland Delf, before a wall table of Raimbrant on blue carriers, made hands.
"It's sure the Russians are more interested in bling"
In fact, the sellers here said that the Russian owned of old capital (10 to 15 years are too high the Russian standards) have already passed along with a limited edition mark that could not be sold in the room.
Yet, thousands of people, whether millionary, issuers of millions or tourists, argue the exposure every day.
And some even buy.
○ The first night of the exposure, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the King Koil beds PDG, said he had sold two sets of soja, cashmer, and incrossed cotton of gold sons.
In the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 moto sales manager, a company equipped cars with last crying systems, also said he had sold to a Russian millionnary, the Porsche orange, for $170,000.
From this Sunday after midnight, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company who personalizes the luxe cars, said that he would sell three cars like bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms at $55,000.
He showed to a reporter, the road of a car drawn for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted her to be incrossed by Swarovski cristals so that she would react to a roulette road.
The seven four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionnary who wants wheels made of furniture, or a photo of his wife made of zirconium, will not be forced with such pneuses," said Mr. Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the expression “Russian million” is not at the order of the day, having regard to the prices of the real estate here.
"If you had bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be millionary, at least on the paper, if it wasn't in speech," he said.
“ There is more than you could think ”
Those who are not millionary can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of the Continental Alliance, a Russian patrimonial management company.
The company has built four stands representatives of British phone cabins, filled with a mass of dollars of counterfeit.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said that his team printed 500,000 fake billets for the Millionary Room.
Breakfasts arrested to launch money masses, ask their friends of photographers on their mobile, in the middle of this fake riches, or a few million.
“ You, here in Moscow, can everyone feel millionary, ” said Karyev.
Unapproval chirurgian suspicious of homicide in New Jersey
It was the guard of thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked at the vineyard of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observed an ambulance that just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on the West Scott Avenue.
Then the police's patrol comes.
And then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stoping," Mr. Livingston, a responsibility of the restaurant, said Wednesday.
That's where I realized that someone was dead.
The authorities would then be that the dead person was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant of the Department of Police Newark.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to an exempt gesture of an unappreciated cosmetic chirurgian, which the police has not yet identified, resident in the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Mele Arroyo's death, but they expect confidential, the results of the toxicological tests that, despite all, will take time, but that should be allowed to solve this mysterious death that attracted the high ranges of Newark's police.
Mrs. Arroyo was the assistant of the police manager, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenace, ” Mr. McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview, Thursday. ”
“ She was like a pit bull ”
“ She would have done everything to protect me ”
Mr. McCarthy said that Mr. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, an ex officer of the police of Newark who worked for the Alcohol Boys Control Committee, and that she left two sons of 14 and 11 years, as well as a beautiful girl.
Eileen Walsj, speaking of the Union County Park, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo was dead because of an unapproval operation.
"It is a possibility to consider."
“The investigation continues. ”
The authorities claimed to have arrived at approximately 15 hours.
and found Melle arroyo on the coffee.
She was determined.
A few more than one week has passed since, and the authorities haven't said much about the question or even on the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not confirm whether Mr. Castro was asked by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical cabinet.
Wednesday, no one opened the door by Mr. Castro, where a famous roser was in the close cimetric front, and a Dalmatian was rejoicing behind.
A blue bidon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for the kitchen vanille and for the parffs, was driving in a hangar, near a door leading to the ground.
Two cars of every land crossed on the sides.
McCarthy said that since his arrival to Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Mr. Arroyo was extremely valuable, he was to navigate in the new city and abandon his political culture.
“ she said, ‘You must take care of this’, he said.
" she was there when I was going, and still there when I went.
"It was invading"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will decrease the rate associated with the importance of the world's bourgeois.
The actions were exploited from the two sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market had hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the credit conditions, which later reduced the interest rates promoted by the peaceful statements of the President of the United States Central Bank.
Bourser markets explode in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald Kohn, no. 2 after Ben Bernanke, the President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the active financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure irritable markets with these new credit stresses, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence, in part, had “inverted certain improvements in the operation of the end of September and October market.
In the event that this hard turbulence had to continue, it would increase the probabilities of later strict financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital in the US markets and that further decreases of interest rate could stabilize the credit conditions.
These comments also allowed Wall Street to calm with even worse news on the American economy, such as the biggest decrease of immobile wins for October.
The effects of this financial tumult were accentuated after the Declaration of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, announced that it would license 650 persons, namely 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to reduce losses due to the payments of immobile loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank works 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55% concluded at 13.289,40 while the largest, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, FTSE 100 took 165,5 points at 2.5%, which concluded to 6306.2 which exceeded 39€ to the value of the British companies.
German Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 increased 2.3%.
Previously, the recovery of the credit difficulties in the markets was released on the strong request for a sale to the three-month funding undertakings issued by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European trade banks at a lower rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the FED and the ECB and to inject further funds in the London financial markets resulting from credit pressures made the three monthly loan rates of Libor to the British banks caused their highest growth since September, 6,59% after a high increase from 12 November.
England faces an appointment to the judgment in relation to the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the batter #6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in such a broad context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the electors, who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, the leader, and Michael V°han, Captain, take his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President-General of England, begins to fill the candidature forms to become a national elector at least part-time.
Whoever doesn't want to get the dosar #6 will be bad, but life is often unjust and sport is also.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to come to the top of his profession while another would never be more than the lower level, sometimes by lack of chance more than by lack of ability.
There is only a cricket that the selection is difficult, because at the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to get Bopara out?
Is it just about Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, which would choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new frames with good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only place for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless at least one chance is given to him?
Numbers have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eyes, at the same time he must take the door and a batter must be happy to touch the cricketer of one day.
But capturing the eyes of the electors is much more complicated.
Many have better done the last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed sure to play the first test, even if Stephen Harmison had declared himself in full form and continued to learn to serve.
Anderson took 32 first class gates on 33 tours to win a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already v ́ their time to glorify at the largest level and hope to offer yet.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's gonna play at the stage of Asgiriya, it's just a question of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes a little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and successfully played in the first, with five doors and 40 useful tours, but this was Paul Collingwood, who was also fighting for the exciting, who succeeded to become the primary cricketor of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double hundred marked against Australia in ↓ could still be estimated.
The probability provides that Graveney, V°han, and Moores, after another discussion after today's session at the stage Asgiriya, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exhaustion of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his major and considerable beginning at the intakes of the 88 Test in Bombay, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, which at 22ans is seven years younger, and his excellent classing at the lancement.
But Shah did only ten tours during his two intakes in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection of the electors when V'han again in form, he claimed his place for the next match, → have disappointed his elephant as obvious in Bombay.
In contrast to him, Essex' player is full of joy to live.
Nothing fears him on a cricket terrain and he exagered when he recently capoted on a 4x4 in the presentation of a Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He reported only of wounds, it was shocked, even if the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well) and call Alastair Cook, his team looking away, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopara is the best battery from far away, his filant deal allows him to make services that go to him, and that he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choose the just man is one thing, choosing the right time in is another.
Is this the real art of the selection?
I would be pleased to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean Shah should not apply if, as the tee feet suggest it, it will be he who will play this weekend.
Business brings people to work, and fights against al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqic repeated repeateds came to Bagdad yesterday, switching these exiles without silver or non-visual renewals, or other who hope that the city has found the normality.
Some have come back to fight against the soldiers who have removed them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the 800 persons transported in the construction of dozens of buses of the Official Government, the terminal was filled with re-eye and Jordan who came back by their means.
"I've decided to go in age after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubasi, a Dr. Sunni.
"I came back today because I saw the television and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw the city is more secure now."
"They say that Mahdi's army doesn't commit crimes anymore!" he said, refering to the mile Shia of the Church Soldier Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to get away for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher of the Amariyah area dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children, because he couldn't renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqian regime prevented the work.
His neighbors from Shia in Amariyah called him to inform him that the mile assisted by the United States allowed Al Qaeda from the West of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had decided to leave his house north of Baghdad because of an attack on the Greece after he urged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
"There were two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me have set a mile anti Al-Qaeda in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys."
"This is why I come back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many say that they have been attracted by the growing accumulation of the capital since the United States troops have arrived, and in the view of the training continues to be “committed citizen groups” well armed and with the American military forces to defend their neighborhood.
But others say that they have been obliged to come back because of the visibility and deficiency of the capital of ̈cus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqites have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion of all of the exile visa that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two million and half of people would have fled from the country because of the sectoral scenarios of death.
"We had no problem until Al-Maliki arrives and encourages the Government to no longer give visa to the Iraqians, to force them to return to Iraq " said Sunni's retirement.
“ I can’t trust a government supporting the elsewhere that burned my house when I went away. ”
The decrease of violence may be in part explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been cast out from Shia areas and ○ versa, creating places where pressures are smaller.
We are afraid that a sudden flow of re-eyees does not repeat sectoral pressures and lead to fights.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest Federated State leads to professional training, even by international orientation of its high schools.
It is only in a field that a deficit is peasing on the Sarroises, similar to the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the fifty-first time to a non-Sarrois that we are not French," it is the slogan that the smallest federal state shows for his fifty-first birthday.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a great role in the Sarre Training System, which is the fifth system placed in the monitoring of the formations of the German Economy Institute of Cologne.
Thus, in tradition, high schools cooperate closely with neighbor countries.
The University was founded at Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students have the opportunity to finish their studies with a double, or even a triple diploma.
It shows that 15.6 percent of foreign students are high.
The Sarre also led the children of the country to higher schools than the average - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Sarre, we benefit from the professional training system," said Axel Plünnecke, expert in training at IW.
More than one of the five receives its title of studies in a professional school, so Sarre has more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities of combination of professional and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In view of the number of residents, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing request, however, the number of engineering diplomats has been decreased by one third in recent years.
That is why the Sarrois Education Ministry obliged schools to be higher than a marketing campaign in the sciences of the engineer.
"Soon the first PISA studies, we celebrated a lot of reforms in the general schools," said a portfolio of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the Government introduced in all the federal states of comparative tests.
In order to start children to start early, the last year of cryche is free of right - a model that is also copied during other federal states.
Only future comparative studies can show whether the performance of the performance is sustainable.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the risk quantity was decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The bavarians get better out of it.
And despite saroes, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise, we could gain points in this area.
Because the neighbor's language is obligatory in schools - even if the saroees are not French.
Keep Clock Rules
In Venezuela, the clock will soon be stuck-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will bring up a half-hour chronometer in the South America country.
Chavez becomes a carcature in Spain in time.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela, due to a new law, the hours will be regulated at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chavez justified its position among others by the fact that the United States would have imposed the world for the separation of time zones in hours.
Moreover, Chavez announced Thursday (local time) the stop of relations with the neighborhood country, Colombia, because of a case of otage.
Left nationalist announced that until the conservator Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he would not have relations with the head of the state, nor with the Colombian Government.
"I can't, just because of my dignity," said Chavez, who quickly makes a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the Oil country must vote on Sunday Referencendum.
With this reform, he would be sensitively strengthening his power in the country.
The dealer of this dispute was the decision of Uriba to return to Chavez the mandate of negotiations on the release of otages with marxist rebellion in Colombia.
Uribe would have "wrapped in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chavez.
In Spain also Chavez is in all the mouths.
A new mobile phone sonnery makes angry in the country: "Why don't you quiet" (why don't you stop) is the phrase that has already downloaded over half a million people on the Internet.
It was announced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, the latest top of Ibéro-American, was angry by the constant interpellations of the people of the left and who told her to kiss.
Reduction of salaries threatened Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjournation, a pronocy, a real loan-value threatens German salaries this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pronostic pessimists.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the salaries should expect a real decrease in their payment fee compared to the year 2007.
"The fault returns to the low development of the salaries, to the reduction of the Tax on the Value and Monting Prices of Food and Energy," Gustav Horn of the Institute for macroeconomic and conjournal research, said.
New charges may also be involved in the field of employment insurance for salaries.
The Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück said in the newspaper "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the estimated decrease of employment insurance by 3.3 per cent for the new year was certain and reasonable in the present situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be in the ambassador to request the Federation of Loans or Financial Assistance, the words of the SPD policies.
We found on Tuesday that the explosion of the prices of food and hydrocarbons has increased the inflation rate to its highest level since 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the hell of the Earth.
Despite his enemy atmosphere to life, Venus reveals more to the Earth than what we believed until now: the European space survey "Venus Express" covered lights in the atmosphere and wind tours to the pools, like those who appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists assume that there are lights on Venus.
The European Sound "Venus Express" has presented this evidence today - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the border of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus spread at a height of approximately 56 km of cloud, reported Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the Scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of Cyprine, the lights would have made life appear on Earth: the orage would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, an angle of life.
This is not the case of Venus: "If there was a life, it must have been at a very old date of history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institute" in Washington.
There should not be live things today on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about 100 times deeper than on Earth, sometimes there is 500 degrees of temperatures.
"Venus may be the hell of the Earth, but it remains a hole," Russell said.
Why Venus, who does not have so much to the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck with such a different development, is the issue of the ASE mission.
The department of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a major step in Venus research, since no longer survey was on the way for the exploration of this planet since the fourteenth-year-year-old years.
From the researcher's opinion, the most recent research results now presented in several "Nature" articles are not only highlighting Venus' singularity within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of Our Neighbourhood are more than the first border.
So the researchers found, besides the wind turbillons already known at the north pool, a cloud turbillon in the South Pool, which is even faster.
The phenoeder reminds the air curants in the winter hemisphers, wrote a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piıoni de l'Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 km, almost as large.
The qualified star planet of the evening or the morning turns around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 earthquakes.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees of Celsius and 92 bar pressure, does not remember the Earth well, scientists assume that the two planets were constituted in similar conditions.
On both sides, the water was accumulated and remained on the Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in the space on Venus.
And when the carbon dioxide was fixed on Earth as carbonate, it is the largest part of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalaï Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler requires the end of the breakdown of parties on the receipt of Dalaï Lama at Chancellerie.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs due to attacks against the Channel after meeting in September.
The Federal Chairman Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and summarizes the great clor coalition of the crash on the receipt of Dalaï Lama.
"We must not present a divisioned nation in the outer world on this issue," Köhler said in the tradeblatt.
Parallelly, Köhler showed the understanding of Dalaï Lama's receipt by Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Man's rights have a universal validity, even if I have respect for cultural differences," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reprochements which it would organize a new Chinese policy.
The German Channeler did not take its distances with the traditional policy of one China.
"Chinese also knows," Köhler said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly informed his misunderstanding about Dalaï Lama's receipt and had been attacked for it outside the CDU ranges.
Steinmeier claimed, in particular, the "foreign policy" of the CDU on foreign policy.
After Dalaï Lama at Chancelleria, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, not only the Chinese Government recommended the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also Spiegel's information, the dialogue on the strategy of foreign ministers of both countries.
The Chine Government leader Wen Jiabao now requests from German Channel Angela Merkel to recognize that Dalaï-Lama's accommodation was a mistake.
China also supported the Chinese position that European political men receive Tibet’s spiritual leader in its official functions.
The words and actions of Dalai Lama would show that he tries to separate from China the Tibet and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Sheuble is watching against the smuggles like France's.
Road fights with police, tires, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble is watching against the wallets like France's.
Everything must be implemented so that social insatisfaction in Germany does not blow out in the streets by violence, requested the German Minister of Industry.
Barricades burning, carriers shooting the police with jailing areas: after the severe juvenile exposures in France, the German Ministry of Industry Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive is not too with us and distorts himself in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Presse" in Hanovre.
Not all young people would come out with the rapid transformation of social reality.
The Federation, Federated States and Communities have already worked closely to reduce the problems, said Sheuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"Integration summits to the Islam Conferences, this has already shown its first success."
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Sheuble notes at the same time as in the German campaigns, there are no sociological problems or urbanism as in France.
In the North Paris agglomerations, young people were delivered to serious street battles with the police last nights.
In Toulouse also, public cars and buildings burned.
Increasing efforts to integrate from the German Government, this was what the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
With emissions in France, Kolat was watching against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would be a need for action.
Kolat focuses on the fact that the unemployed quota among young people under 25 years of immigration would be greater than the average.
First of all, it should be provided for more training places.
Kolat insisted: "We must give youths a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish Communities implied that social control in the families was more in Germany than in France.
Moreover, many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "We must still be worthwhile."
It should "invite youths to be able to participate in work and training".
Waiting, in the Paris faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were located, a helicopter surrounded the area with projectors.
The postal authorities were part of three arrests and some burned cars and powder.
Since the confession, some 1,000 security forces have a peaceful deployment.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, the Minister of the Interior of Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit of the faubourg.
On Wednesday night, nearly 80 police officers were wounded in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles were overwhelmed in Toulouse.
Emotioners exploded after an accident of employment in which two young people had lost their life Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Park, the police is not responsible for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The outopic scene input of the Channel shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and that there is no more to wait for it.
In what country does this opportunity live to the right?
After his disappointing intervention in the German Parliament's general debates, which was chaotic and poor, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should finally be governed by it.
The reproach of too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel from a hard and predictive phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and she just showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it has made all of how precise that reproach was.
There was neither specific interest nor good feelings for the problems of the country to feel.
Instead, Angela presented himself as a cloud: a politician in appointment, who fled in foreign policy and who even remained in the nearby.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes itself on the agreements of Saint-Endam, but does not say how climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even, the self-elogic - having so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have made it two years ago.
Now she cramps to forms of all facts, that growth would touch people.
Thus it destroys its image of pragmatist, which solves the problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the empire of the cloud Angela, the internal policy problems are a marginal phenomena.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low salary workers?
There are some accessories to him for this.
In this matter, it is evident that the number of times it makes lapsus when it is family allocation.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a specific half-speed phrase.
It tits in an unknown area since it becomes concrete.
The attack
In the Youtube Debat of the Republican candidates to the presidential, both of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favors have been delivered to a heavy offensive battle - and now have to be afraid of an outside candidate.
The pressure of candidates is already in the first area.
He would have made New York a "refuge for Clandestins", reproaching Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This against his side by hardly reproached: "I would say his own house was a hair for clandestins" Giuliani answered and reproached the former ruler of Massachusetts that they used immigrants without paper.
The candidates are on the attack: as the Republic's foundation does not have official favors, eight candidates to the presidential are in front of debates on the CNN in order to discreet their opposers.
The 30-second amatory films that Internet users have sent via Youtube are almost more than sufflers.
"It's with this kind of isolationism that we have left Hitler to come to power," John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate retreat in Iraq.
Romney also makes the lesson vigourously by the Vietnamian veterinarians, when he condemns as a torture which is called "Waterboarding", an intrerrogatory method where the noyade is simulated.
However, the fact that the important theme of the campaign goes outside the war in Iraq and the debates on torture is found in the reactions of St. Petersburg's Common Room in Florida.
Whether preserving values be praised or the future tax increases are decreased, the applauses are deferred in the audience.
This is where it appears again when the weaknesses of the two favours are resident.
"I made a mistake at that time," said Romney contrists and presents his excuses on the basis and television public for being still a party in 1994.
In contrast, Giuliani passes in a node running when it is asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civil.
One day after his return as the leader of the armies, the Pakistanian powerman Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of domination by the army end.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested Thursday for a new mandate of five years.
The Pakistanian television directly transmitted the ceremonie to the presidential palace of Islamabad capital.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the Nation.
Wednesday he had transferred his military head charge to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus was the international pressure, especially the United States.
Eight years after his power was taken by a bloodless puzzle, the former general rules for the first time as a civil head.
Thus Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of opposition and O.O.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency state which Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Shortly after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the emergency status, General Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus will fill another requirement of the O.
The Supreme Court of Justice, which Musharraf had been occupied after the establishment of the emergency status with the jurists of its ranks, had rejected all the complaints against the controversious election of the head of the State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribe region of Waziristan in the North, with an attention to a military convoy, and four other vulnerable.
According to the indications of the military port, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
Krautrock's fathers get back.
The supergroups of Germany for the sixty-twenty years play: the three members of the Harmonia Group have taken their console again in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, records of their great success "Live 1974".
In that time, they were much more with the foreigner.
The planned feeling then occurs in the form of three years of age in the evening office.
Everyone has his little bottle before him, his cable, and all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at 63 years of age, trone in the middle of a white chemistry as snow.
It is flattened at the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old youth and owned by a mobile guardian and a guitar.
On the right hand, observed by all the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, is running on his console.
Each contributes to the sound, including even a Beat.
And sometimes it is inadvertent to a traditional music song.
This is not too distressing the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again has assured some emotions among Krautrock' amateurs.
We have the right to devote it here: targeted investigations show that the name, of course, is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way so sustainable so that this group is so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why would the German also not have the right to celebrate its lives in the sixty-twenty years?
More than what the "Krautrock" is deeply called, it has still grown more in literature and in America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry determined the Echo price for their work in 2003 by Cologne Can's group's superintendents, the German pop faces were seen in the room.
When Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups The Düsseldorf and Neu! in the pangyrical eology, the surprise had no longer limites.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother was running on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance among himself and the transfiguration in the unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio was only two years and that during this period, the power of impact that felt was much weaker than what he had later been assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promised name of Cluster.
We're playing a board in the caves below the Berlin scene.
Following Düsseldorf, for a label subvented by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had shortly deployed in powerwork and finally made a name as guiyaste with Neu!, which may have been the most radical German group at the time.
To 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an ancient closed Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they viewed as members of communities fleeing from the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Commune I", where Roedelius had the right to turn himself as a nurse.
Instead of a artistic existence as Spitzweg.
Soi-disant was in the puzzle a fanion of the Harmonia Ottenstein choral and also a name for art.
Many retire Harmonia away from this.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because it was very severe and modesty as the music sounds, the group suffered from maternal mistress.
The collection of the dead wood served not only to himself.
The "Live 1974" CD that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem before a public record of nearly 50 heads, and someone thinks to remember.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train timely.
It was an immoral need for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother attracted in the isoterism areas and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster reanimated himself in the fourteen years and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We need the Live of Griessem in Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Groenland was determined to hold Krautrock as a German contribution to modern music.
New! had already been deterred at this opportunity as Roedelius' personal work.
Resurrection of Harmonia is located at the World Cultural House in Berlin.
Subventionally, under the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, ancient punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
The inflation margin of Krautrock' influenza would be regarded as regards the future pop music.
The empty place left by the group will be compiled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase planes in the middle of the single sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are photos that show producers with Harmonia in the close room.
The projections of other photos in black and white tools captured on baser serves for the training of the engine.
Before, the three veterinarians are busy again to improve.
But more increasing microphones to org and batteries, to draw the instruments of unused sounds through self-constructed effect instruments.
Today, electronic music is nothing to electronic music.
The three in large technical figs.
In that case, the choral of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we get all and shoot under the sound cloud, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very tragic concept.
He never acted as a rock.
Racines were less searched in blue than in music conservators (Can), in Kraftwerk, or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who cries "68" has no completely wrong, and Harmonia doesn't allow it to wrath now.
But what the most is going on will be covered minutely on the scene.
Where's the music starting and where's it finished?
This can tap on the nerves of someone (?) or give refuge moments of great joy.
Richard Gere isn't just genuine enough.
"The Hunting Party" and "The Morder Peace", two films re-cover the battle of the Balkans.
But they both don't convince.
Or projects are too high on the action and on the exchange of insensitive tissues, in contrast, they are too harmful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news at the border: certain Karadzic and Mladic wars are always hidden in the Balkans mountains, but it is just there, in the lowest country of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
Lastly, we lost the greatest man of the fourteen years, because many too deep and foolish roles in women's feelings and too many press conferences on Buddhism's theme were pleased to show him.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party" - when the jailer becomes thrilled (why should today's films be as long and confused as collective conventions of lokomotive drivers?)
He gives a wonderful representation full of eyes climbs: at the bottom, his personality to report war Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destination and the film industry were not so well-pleasant: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruin at his decline, kept the rest of his former charm.
But despite this hostel, "The Hunting Party" continues with the German "Mord Peace" production, which also comes out this week, the infinite follow-up of films rated on the Balkan war.
The movie is quickly conducted by "Mord Peace": the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb of Cosovarian francs, in which one of the two is still lovingly falling.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not presented for a time as the only causes of all evil, this movie is so blue as a television is lost too quickly in the insensitive action and exchange of insects.
This remains a sort of "Alarme for Cobra 11" without autoway but with a war at the place.
On the contrary, we can examine the perfect example of the Hunting Party, why there was never a real good movie on the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioning to trace the high war "the renard", might have become, with another realisator and another scenario (two at the same time Richard Shepard), a new "Apocalypse Now".
Since the stories are intriguing: two males go into a small team in the forest, to do something that the soldiers cannot do, and for both males, it becomes a travel in foolishness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not leave Simon Hunt to be the cynic desert of a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must grant him a romantic aventure with a Bosnia and later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes permanently bad, when reporting it, in the past five minutes, by a accelerated procedure, reaches that the NATO, → and all the world's primary hunters have failed in five years: catching the war and allowing it for a righteous vengeance to the Muslims.
It is so bad that the International Court of Auditors of Crime should be introduced against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the movie has too deep anxiety.
He wants to declare that Karadzic and Mladic are still in freedom, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exclusively agreed) that they do not drive the jail in a very intense way because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are this time so similar that a famous poem of Brecht comes to the idea.
This speaks of a wooden mask of a Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compatient, I see the vineyards of the thrown front, and it is: how fatiguing it is to be wicked."
The films such as The Hunting Party have exactly such tuscent heads, but suggest how fatiguing it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the type of films on the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this journal that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
It can be said: There have never been good films on South Africa.
What's worth every time: when a star gets on a crisis house or on a mine field, then there comes something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go to border" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Character DiCaprio.
All these conflicts are still too close in time.
Whatever it happens, decades have always passed before Hollywood can turn a good movie on the holocaust with the "The Schindler List".
Some films must still be mature - those who today worth classical works on the Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unifiedly at their time as work leaders.
But maybe we also know today too simply about the world conflicts, where every hecatombe comes directly on two screens at the same time at home,
And this is a pleasure for the scenarios to lack of scrupules they need to tell beautiful stories.
"By or not" or "The dictator" has actually become so good as because Luōisch and Chaplin don't know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when we want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastic and distant artistic view of the romance Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked about the parallel between his historic "Dictionary of Lempire" and the war of the Balkans, he answered: "This is only because some things never change."
"The big cities will always be terriblely dangerous, men will always be embraced in a terrible way and the war will always rule in Yugoslavia."
It's Beust's criticism for the cancellation of Olympiades.
The recovery of the Major with Hambourg's candidature for the Olympics of Eastern Games took place in politics and economics with critical virulents.
Many want to continue to settle for the Water Games.
But Von Beust calls the realm in appreciation of chances.
The Master Director of the Hambourg Trade Chamber, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a leave on Wednesday as a "mal for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had developed as much motivation forces in the city as the idea of Olympiades.
"without this goal, the political-sport-elan could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senat to not bury the project but to find him a new longer-term point of department, "which takes as a point of department another agenda".
Major Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday to its statements, which had the olympical ambitions of Hambourg, at least until 2028.
"This is not Hambourg who decides of an Olympian candidate, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," said Von Beust to WE_ONLINE.
He returns to the expected decision of the Sports Federation on the candidature of Munich for winter games 2018.
This preference means for us that, in the time we had planned up to 2028, we will not have any chance."
However, the dream does not permanently belong to the past, says Von Beust.
The Hambourg Sport Federation (HSB) regreted Beust's statements.
This would be the impression that Hambourg doesn't want to put his candidature for Olympical Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by burying the projects now," the President of HSB Günter Ploß said Thursday.
A cancellation of the candidate would be more contrary to the declarations of the Senate head at the occasion of the receipt at the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hambourg's candidature at the Universities of 2015 as "no substitute" for Olympics Games in Hambourg.
The Supreme Sports Federation had a border in the past weeks called Hambourg as candidate city.
The Major SPD fraction reproached the Senat that he had not used this valuable time in the building of accommodations in Hambourg.
"The development of the Petit Grasbrook has been held by the Senat for years because he has played the Olympias card and has excluded the building of apartments," said the delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quest.
While the SPD has always claimed to the Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiades and a later use of apartments, the CDU would have put on the "Event Factory".
The candidate for the Olympics Olympics in 2012 would have highlighted a great enthusiasm in Hambourg.
But Hambourg was broken against Leipzig.
That's not Warhols' boxes.
Who connects the concepts of Sweden and boxes in wood, thinks about Ikea, but not on Andy Warhol.
Are you sure?
Currently, wood boxes in Sweden cast shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
A large part of the 14th Brillo-Boxs of "Type Stockholm" listed there are contraventions.
After the Swedish magazine "Expressen" doubted the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs in 1968 of Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm today leads to a designer result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former leader of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave a gift in 1995 in the Moderna Museet, are copies - and a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which are on the international market of art.
The ancient history is enclosed, a combining coverage of artificial and curatoric productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painting wood boxes, based on the red-blau-blau-black design of soap cartons in the powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet was present in 1968 - with Warhol agreement - hundreds of brillo boxes made of carton: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol but were directly delivered from the Brillo cartoning factory.
It was not here for art works, but instead of their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given the employment in 1968 to make some wood boxes in Brillo in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the time today speak of about 15 wood boxes that at the time would be entering right in the history of art and business, as Brillo-Boxes originally authorised by Andy Warhol, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached over $100,000 in the winnings.
The problem is now that the director of the Pontus Hultén Museum said wrongly, later than about 100 wood boxes were produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have ceded to him.
In fact, the 105 boxes of Hultén were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St Petersbourg.
At that date, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the leader of the Moderna Museet, examined, near the six Brillo-Boxes of the Museum, three other Swedish private collections, among which two were constructed in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were printed and pointed, then used with a white oil painting pink.
The texture of copies from 1990 shows that the painting has been directly applied on the stratified panels, using a painting roll - it is no longer a oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of the Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," lets the director of the Modern Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the "Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board" in New York is not a decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/material exhibition."
In July, the Authorisation Board has heard that he would ask for the "worries" that will be raised in the case of swine boxes in powder.
But since we've been incrediblely silenced down there.
