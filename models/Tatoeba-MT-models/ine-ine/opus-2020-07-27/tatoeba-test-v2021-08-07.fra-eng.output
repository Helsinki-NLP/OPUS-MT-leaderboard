It is the Algerian regime that creates terrorism in Algeria by teaching islamic requirements in schools and creating terrorist groups to maintain a fearful climate that allows business sales. This is suitable for Algerian who do not want to remove religious education in schools.
It is time for the various nations to understand that a neutral language can become a real removal against the monopolisator influences of one or two languages only, as this is now more evident. I sincerely want to make a rapider progress of hope in the service of all the nations of the world.

It doesn't make any difference, whether he comes or not.
That doesn't have any sense.
It's important.
That's important.
He should rain soon.
He can deny the evening.
It can be crazy, but I think I'm still in love with Marie.

That's exactly because I loved her, I didn't marry her.
It's because you don't want to be alone.
It's been a long time.
That's the way since the night of the time.
It's starting to come back!
It's better to be a winner than a perfection.
It is preferred to return back instead of lose.

It's one of my favorites.
This is only a short-term efficient.
They are only religious and religious.
It's for me.
He's on my office.
It's on Monday evening at 9:00.
It's on the canaphouse.

It's not necessary.
You're gonna do something like that.
It is the judge to decide whether a complaint can take place to a police investigation.

I was afraid.
It's very close.
It's very difficult to know yourself.
It's very funny.
He's very hot, isn't he?
The time to go to your bed is far over.
It's your duty to vote.
It's your money.
It's your only shot.
A hirondle doesn't make the first time.
It must be three to appreciate a good story: one to tell it well, one to kiss it, and one to not understand it. Because the first two are doubled by the incomprehension of the third.
That takes time.
It's very good go.
There was a national investigation to find the death.
It took a lot of time to raise it at our viewpoint.

It was a chance for her husband to come at that moment.
It's been done in hand.
It was his choice.
It was his choice.
He was heavy, I couldn't take it longer.
It was warm in all the senses of the word.
It was late in the night when Tom finally arrived with him.
It costs less than 15 dollars.
They laughed at me.
It was my choice.
It was at my turn to play, and my king was not attacked, that he wasn't done. But any of my pieces could not make a valid movement. So, what is called "noyed king" or "equality by noyade" was characterized. The part was a match no.
It was my turn to break the room.
It's been nice for you to come.
It wasn't concluding.
It was a real miracle.
There was nothing to overcome.

That was the best thing that never happened to me.
It was the only thing to do.
It was very smart from his part to guard the pot-de-vine.
It was yesterday I saw him down the street.
You were wrong.
It will be a great pleasure to translate this story and read it from you.
It's gonna be very hot.
This will take five to ten years before it is ready.
