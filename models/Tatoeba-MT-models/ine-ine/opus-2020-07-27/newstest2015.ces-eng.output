Peter Chech: Overcome for the last moment?
It's all possible
Today is the last day when you can go through the transmission window and make a big transition.
The next chance will come in the winter.
Peter Czech, currently replacer Chelsea, but now he is not sitting over the new professional with Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
It sits in the NH Hotel, speaks with the Czech journalists and wants to be with the Czech representation of the General General with America, and then also on the east start of the Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea, a new season of Premier League has the preference of Thibaut Courtois, Chech first received in the London club in the first ten years of the replacement.
Earlier, it was speculated that it could be interested in Real Madrid.
The Spanish Superpohar was lost at the introduction of the season in combats with the Atletic and couldn't even enter the liquor season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It was also speculated about the interest of Paris SG.
The French League's season split two hours and two puzzles, shot St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
The most relatively pressing AS Monaco boot club.
He's in the lira while the 1-1-2 balance, and on weekend he's disrupted with Lille in the middle of the 1st.
Today, on the bulvary Ethiopian webs, the reports that the Czech could want to be in Queens Park Rangers.
According to Ethiopian bookmakers, but the Czech leaves from Chelsea at the last moment is not too probably.
Scybet writes the course 4:
Peter, maybe you're gonna change your clothes for a few hours during the rest?
I'm not counting it, but there's never anything worthwhile in the ball.
Perhaps there will be a offer that will not be rejected during the day.
How would that offer look like?
(Laughter) "I don't know how the offer that can't be refused is actually looking like.
It would have to reach the meeting of all the parties Previous would be interested in the position of Chelsea if he would solve an eventual offer of the club or not.
Is it technically implementable to do such a transition when you're now in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary to sign a new contract in a new way?
So I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are players today, everyone is somewhere at representative meetings, and it is certainly still going to be closed today.
So it would certainly be a realistic thing.
How many clubs on the planet they could allow you?
Well, I don't really know.
So you're not going to leave?
The situation when I didn't catch the new season in the first three stories is a new career for me after 15 years.
However, it doesn't be able to panic, pack, and get somewhere away.
I want the fight on the position of Chelsea, and it's on the trainer who will choose what decisions he will make in the next weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision?
I'm taking into account all the factors.
It's important for me to understand sport, but I'm looking at it from the personal page in which the needs of the family, of course, belong.
Is it possible that you'd catch for another club in England?
That's the question I thought I would never have touched me.
But there's all possible in the ball.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.

Renewal of the very American idea that the work of rights is equal to human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have made a law that has an organization in the committees to protect as civil law.
"On the way the committees work, the work of the Middle Class is working," Ellison, the Democratic Senator for Minnesota, who is the co-president of the Congress Committee.
That is why I am so proud that I can present the law that strengthens the position of employees together with the pattern of the periodic rights of John Lewise.
This main legislation gives the employees the same legal opportunity to prevent discrimination in the organization of committees as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-committee forces
Adjusting the Law on Working Affairs in order to enable all employees who face discrimination if they want to be involved in the committees, to judge themselves in the civil court - and to judge the damage or replacement of damage - is a right and necessary initiative.
It's certainly not a radical initiative -- at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other law enforcers present is to refer to the American idea again.
Despite the fights of the committee that have been in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other States - the Americans have ever supported the countries worldwide to accept, expand and respect the work of rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country was providing democracy, freedom of words, freedom of printing and right to confusion.
When the United States after the Second World War, Japan, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the constitution proposed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their committees played a role in the forming of new Japan, included the language in them and recognized that “the right of employees to distort themselves, to negotiate collectively and to act is guaranteed”.
When the United States after the Second World War, Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged Germany to create a constitution that will ensure that Adolfa Hitler's fascism will be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees in a new nation would need to organize and promote, and thus included clauses that were openly saying: “The right to create associations that will ensure and improve work and economic interviews will be guaranteed to each individual and to each individual and to each call or profession.
The negotiations that will restrict this right or strive for its damage will be cancelled. The provisions leading to the fulfillment of such a person are illegal.
When the former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt president of the International Commission for Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide conciliation, they included in her the International Committee on Human Rights that “each person has the right to protect his interests to establish and enter the committees.”
The United States all generations accepted the fundamental premises that the work of rights is human rights.
When the country consulted to other countries how to create a civil and democracy society, the Americans explained that the right to create the work of the committees - and their collective negotiation with companies and government agencies in the position of a equal partner - must be protected.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American idea that workers must have the right to organize and promote the free and open society.
As the reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said for fifty years ago:
History is a big teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the group's forces haven't been reduced, but have spread it.
Increased life standards of millions of people, created a market for industrial and production leaded to an unexpected level.
Those who attack the committees are aware of these simple truths, but the story remembers them.
The story doesn't care, and we didn't have too.
Formal recognition of work rights as humans - and enlargement of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organization of committees - has great delay.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewed the ideas that led America and made a promise of democracy.
Judge has temporarily locked the law that could close all the transaction clinics in Louisiana
The Federal Court suspended the Louisian law on Sunday, which, according to the lawyers, would probably close all five clinics to lose losses in the state.
In June 1, September, the lawful signature of Bobby Jindala's Louisian Ruler would require the right to accept the patient in the hospital from 30 miles from the performance of their practice.
The judge's resolution means that doctors may continue temporarily in the execution of legal losses and must be careful for this authorisation.
"The party will be able to act legally and will be authorised," it states in the resolution of the Federal Judge John deGelselles.
The hearing will be planned during one month so that the judge may issue a more sustainable resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to lose the resolution last in a series of similar measures have welcomed and said that he will provide more time to the doctors to get authorisation.
"The present decision ensures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the law that is to prepare for health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, the President and the Executive Director of the Centre for Playing Rights, which, on behalf of three of the five clinics, made a claim to block the law.
It was not immediate whether the decision was related to doctors of two clinics that were not among the complainants, and they also requested the grant of this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven States who have approved similar laws, while the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures as anti-republication.
The key parts of Texas law that would close the number of remaining clinics in the state blocked the federal judge on Friday.
The fighting for women's rights to deal with the United States of Natives and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association claims that the need to have this authorisation for a doctor's demand which is not necessary in the medical manner.
The opponents opposed the objective of measures to protect women’s health and some have also welcomed the fact that clinically closed by measures.
The Centre for Playing Rights has stated that in Louisiana only one doctor is authorised to carry out losses.
The group said that all the doctors in the state would have been forced to stop carrying out losses, so that this doctor would also stop taking steps in fear of his safety.
The Louisian Offices in the reaction stated that the doctors who have losses would not remain while waiting for the establishment of a request for a grant of rights.
Latest diagnosis and bad treatments are more frequently killed by egg cancer
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with their deceased mother's team who died for the cancer of eggs in 2007.
Women in Australia's forestry threaten the risk that they die for the cancer of eggs than for their opposers in the city.
The investigators analysed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians in 2005 with egg cancer and found that only 35 % of five years after diagnosis lived.
Susan Jordan research from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute stated that women in foreign and remote state were about twenty percent higher likely to die during the study than women in towns.
SPECIAL STUDY: New medicines can slow the cancer of pulmonary and eggs
Women's researchers followed during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the possibility of survival affected women during diagnosis, type of carcinoma eggs, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest level of survival was produced in elderly women with cancer in a progressive stage.
In women in foreign and remote states, about 20% higher probability that they died in the study than in women in towns.
Although the study was not proposed to determine why women living outside the city were higher likely to die for the cancer of eggs, Dr. Jordan claims that factors may be late diagnosis and bad treatment.
"The disease is best able to treat gynecooncologists who are usually sitting in other cities," she said.
Even though the improvement of the remote medical services that have to overcome the remote barrier, the doctor said that it would help to strengthen the transport services that specialists can treat women closer to their homes, and programmes to support people who are remotely treated from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study discovered that the survival of women with egg cancer is low regardless of the geographical position, which highlights the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
The link financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today is public Medical Journal of.
In March 2012, the young mother Elish Neave from the city of Gold Coast was aggressioned with the form of cancer of eggs in her 33 years.
Gardens Centre decreases the decrease of the number of owners of homes
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decrease associated with an extraordinary property of the householders of younger than 35 years could lead to that, until today’s young generation of consumers reaches “the main group of gardens”, the garden centre will come to 10 million pounds per year.
According to the reports, people who find residence will be lost for their gardens, in the average 55% of the amounts that people will lose in their lives.
As other threatening factors of the sector, which produce 5 billion pounds per year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanized areas, where they are not gardens, the depth of the depth instead of the pregard used as the parking area and the decreasing size of the garden.
In London, where the share of homes has fallen from 61 % to 43 % during six years, the lowest household costs for foreign products in Britain are covered.
HTA and the Royal Gardens Society indicated that residence in a farm or a lack of space does not mean that people could not cultivate plants.
Guy Barter, the main garden adviser for RHS, said: “The premises have a very favorite plant planting in flowers - when they move, plants can be taken with themselves.”
The HTA report revealed that the “goilty” of the foreign small trade sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was a higher share of home owners and economic prosperity from the 80th to the half of the 90s.
He also foretold that this year would be higher for the best time, which came after the inappropriate events in March and April.
When the east dictator preachs democracy.
After Putin, at the meeting of his youth organization, who mostly attends Hitlerjugend, saved me with atomic weapons and mostly showed that their opinions were stolen by him, he gave us a democracy statement today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows a lot of drawings of the fascist state.
Great nations have one community and it is that they can be controlled as well as drunk nationalism, as well as that complex minority can transform into imperialist shouts.
The time goes eastly different than the west.
While the west world thought that the time of war on the government of Europe was long away, the east thinks that they had already been overseen and that they had to be restored to their international position.
This was the way we and frustration ruled in Germany in 30 years, soon before the capture of Nazis power, and then followed the explosion of nationalism today in Russia.
And then the completely coherent culture of the strong leader, the laughing of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that is, therefore, not a lot similar.
Vladimir Putin, and most of the Russians, probably, are declining after the time when Russia was a half of the world and the second part of the world.
The west politicians may have committed it themselves, perhaps a little Vladimir was paying for his arm, maybe they didn't call him where he was stuck, and they may have started to underestimate him, and he was just being a typical Russian man.
He's done a job at home, he's faced that he didn't want anywhere, and broke his knife at home.
Now he's determined to get a lost position back.
It's starting slowly, it's time.
The leader's probably on the survival, so he's going quickly.
He fell Kawakazani, now the Ukrainians, then they are in a series of patiences from Pobalti.
The Russian wheat's already whiping in the skin enough.
It is clearly that China is noticed, which is too exciting and is sure it makes a deal to the far-east.
And the Germans, that Vladimir, are also nicely black as well and I gave them that in 45, so on the back.
That's how to do a new new news in Karl Varech.
It would be a basketball, and ours are there a lot and how they print them there, and they want to get a lecter of them.
Because our veterinarians still remember what they had in this Czech Slovenia.
Nu vote their Prime Minister on the Sabbath, that is so weak, it will be broken as a cibule, and the whole EU will be dreamed.
It would be so playing to get up to the big Russian.
They need to remember where their place is.
And as an explosion, we use our companions who live in their territory.
The Russians are all over there, and when they say they're printing there, they're just printing there, and we don't leave it, we'll protect them.
And the Russian will rule again, to what else he is born.
Europe, however, is just good as a presentation on which the proud Ivan can dance a goat.
Turkey called an American diplomate for a spion report

We don't have anything to lose.

Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israelites who were near the Gaza Pass returned to the school on Monday after they spent a summer in antibombs, while during the fifty-year war between Israel and Hamas, rackets and minometes attacked their homes. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory remembers the wars.
The beginning of the school brought to the community in the south of Israel known attacks of joy and excitement, but the signs of battle are still clear.
In Asdoda, the city in the south of the country, the staff of the school, which was in the racket, removed from the wall the rest of the wall, and allowed the child to return.
"We have a little fear, but otherwise we rejoice," said Ronit Bart, the kibuc inhabitant of Saad and the teacher of English at the local school.
Many kids from this are actually going back to the daily routine.
She's 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart told that "it's a little special" to go back to school.
"We lived a few hard moments and we didn't leave the house," she said.
Kibuc, near the border with Gazo, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the end of the end of the war, thousands of residents like Saad stayed inside their homes or homes, and went to the safe distances from Gaza to avoid rackets and minomets.
A lot of Naal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, in which she shot from the Palestinian minomete, killed a four-year-old boy with weight.
The Minister of School stated that about twelve families haven't yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
The president of the government of Benjamin Netanjah visited a school in Sderot, a town in the border with Gaza, which was strongly inhabited by the Palestinian fuel.
He invited children to study diligently, and added: "We will put your education and security on you."
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timely unlimited peace last Wednesday.
The stop of the fuel led to the immediate end of the fight, however, the key problems such as Hamas' request for the end of the Israeli-Egypt blocking of Gaza and the recycling of aircraft and the Gaza stations were not resolved.
Israel demands Hamas' weapons and returns the bodies of two soldiers falling in the war.
It is expected that the new road of the indirect acts takes place in this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of the Palestinians and the United Nations in the war, more than 2 100 Palestinians died, from whom three quarters were civilized and at least 494 children.

66 soldiers and six civilians died in the country of Thai.
Hamas and other Gaza's radicals shot during the battles in Israeli cities mainly in the south of the land 4 591 raketes and shoots from the minomets.
The Israeli army again took more than 5.000 aircrafts and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks have hurt or destroyed thousands of houses in Gaza and have been hidden in hundreds of United Nations schools, which have been transformed into a temporary guard.
For decades of thousands of people who remain in secrets, and for persistent battles, school officers have rejected the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened, and they could finish education as the Jewish children and the rest of children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in the largest city of Gaza.

On Wednesday evening, Vrba called as the last player of Spanish founder Luke yours.
He admitted that it wasn't easy to decide, taking into account other center polymers.
I decided that Luke was a perspective player who was 25 years old.
The decision was very complicated, but I'm standing behind it," he hit Vrba to Vah.
What about Shural?
Let's see what's going on with Latata.
It is not concluded that the nomination could still be changed in the case of health problems.
The weekend, for example, the liberal Joseph Schural, who gave hattrick, explained a fine execution.

The worm is not that he has more time to train from the previous meetings.
It is a benefit when you have players eight days and you can practice with them certain things that we must have not had so much time before.
Now we will be able to focus on it, and we will be able to prepare the best for Netherlands," he praised Vrba.
The Netherlands will be presented on Thursday in Italy before they arrive in Prague, and the duel will personally follow the former temporary representative boat Joseph Peschice.
He gives us the information that's from the storage.

Lenny Henry: My father never took me.
He never told me, "I've got you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaica in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the bathroom, they had more cold relationship.
Henry is trying a commodity, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is part of the radio series 4.
Soundtrack is a mixed reggae and rape and melodie is optimistic.
But Henry had to advise some of the uncomfortable ancestors of childhood.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a "based" therapy and now he thinks about his relationship with his father.
He knew it very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice: “Stop with this.
Leave your sister in the room.
Shut up!
Look at the cricket.
My elderly brothers Seymour and Hilton -- when I was a child, they were growing up with him -- they went to the bar and discussed things like the face of a beer or the beer's beer in the cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life was a serious guy in the corner that reads the newspapers.
Henry recently visited the Dudley Sleevar, and although the undermines were better than at the dad's time, he looked at what he had to be for.
Today there's something more light, but it's still dark, dark, dark labyrinth, where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and smoke.
My dad walked into the van and just lied there, then it was hearing how slowly he started to sing for himself, because he was sing from himself.
When I went around, I realized that he did this for years to enjoy the family, and I started to appreciate it more.
Nevertheless, Henry lived childhood without parents' love.
Dad didn't take anybody, he didn't say, "I've got you."
When Mom was sick and died, we began to say, "I have you, I have you, I have you."
His daughter Billie, who had Dawn French, allowed him to enjoy love that was missing him as a child.
Can you stop that "I've got you?"
Don't worry about me yet!
Dad, I'm 22!
S Dawn French.
Why shouldn't they be friends?
It's a great mom.
With French who was married 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
It's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had a sugar.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot of, very big overview, and the symptoms of sugar began to be shown, the doctor said to me, "You have to make radical changes."
So I started walking into a great fitness center, and I had to keep a drastytic diet to get out of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
I'm disnamed.
No one wants to eat darkness himself.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, shortly preserved bridge.
After he got recognized from his criticism for Othella, he was deceived into the district.
She followed the Comedie full of mistakes and the Plots of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than sithcomes and comedies that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16, and he worked in the bathroom.
DJ noticed him on the underground of somebody, and wrote about him in a talented competition of New Faces.
His television career started in the half of the 70s: “I was the only black-comic imitator/comic in the television. ”
He's learned about the travel.
Furthermore, the public had to observe me, I had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to think of functioning whispers, to be a star and to come in television, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the manifest production of the Black and White Minstrel Show, the debt of the program in which the herds were dressed for the black, Henry finally spent five years in it.
My family was no longer aware of that.
I want it to never happen, but I don't.
Although it was a special and crazy position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with a dave.
What was the "years and years assessed by the main product of the British TV", but it was also the "ground parody of the black".
In the 80 ’ s, Henry worked in alternative comedial cross-borders and represented statutes that also dismissed and celebrated the British Black Culture.
By the series The Lenny Henry Show began to send in 1984, and in the 90s, he was known outside otherwise as the Chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedial Serial Chef!.
For the next decades, his advertising, documents, television series and roles in films, but after sending his series LennyHenry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said: "So what you're going to do now, Lene, it seems to be a little like that you've been cut into one place, or you're getting a little down from the way."
The next row was a documentary order at Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
It was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy at Shakespeara.
We didn't learn him right at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone with whom we were talking in order, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't think about what you don't know about what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all have Shakespear like that.
Henry for the document offered twenty lines of Othell's final word and was already in it.
I felt that I could do it.
It's like it'd give me courage.
"It's about it. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn text, find something about it.
So the test was strong, and before I read the game for months and months.
And it was success.
It seemed to be waiting for springs, what happened.
Soon he started playing a full mistake in the Commission.
I was once in the National Division, I couldn't believe it.
At one moment, I thought, "You changed."
It happened to the technical commitment and Henry instinctly felt that he had to take the responsibility for the public's entertainment.
"The story in my head said, 'Before the computer is fixed, you have to buy them now ten minutes'."
Instead, the wonderful register announced that the representation would continue as soon as the problem is resolved.
I went out of the jail and something in me said, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotech in Duchess Theatre
Teaching the text of the Plots was a challenge.
Panica's pretty good, she adds a decision.
The game was also well accepted, so it is like God's sign that says, "This should be done."
Of course, it says by the voice of the voice.
So I'm staying at that.
I have it really.
I'm not in the experiment.
However, Henry remains the brain of a comedian - all the time our conversation interrupts the humoral exhibitions when it comes into and comes out of the role of the imitator.
I decided not to stand up, because having satisfaction from the room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
When you're still looking for something, you can get into a blind hall.
Sometimes, if I want, I'm doing Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy as before.
I wondered if he's still organizing a stand-up tour.
The pleasure to sit in a room with a register that helps give up the start, the end and the road -- I don't think I would ever want to give it.
So your new incarnace?
I think so.
I'm enjoyed by heretics.
It's fun.
You still tell stories, what's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers the State officials to congratulate to non-existing employees
Kenya started with the biometric registration of all its officials in order to try to remove from the payment list of the government without employment.
According to the statement of the Government, employees who are not registered in the next two weeks shall cease to receive payment.
The government believes that thousands of people are payable and after the State service has left.
After arresting the Office in 2013, President Uhura Kenyatta promised that it would be restricted to corruption in the State administration.
The audit carried out in this year showed that the state comes monthly at least one million dollars (700 000 pounds) on the payments of non-existing employees and on further use of official power.
The Government is suspicious that payments are continued to be placed on the bank and after the death of the employee or after the dead of the State administration, the reporter BBC from the main city of Nairobi, Wanyam Chebus.
All State officials shall be delivered to the identification centres during the next two weeks where their data will be biometric mentioned in the statement of the government.
Next, everyone who doesn't leave without a sufficient excuse will be extracted from the payment list.
"The establishment of the public service will contribute significantly to its accommodation and will also be used to clear the payment list at both levels of governments and will solve the problem of non-existing employees," said Anne Waigur, the Secretary of the Ministry for Development and Planning.
Decades of Turkish police arrested for the "suppression" against government
Local media indicate that in Turkey there was a suspicion of the "government commitment" of 33 police.
The case has been commented by the police office.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, there was fourteen highly established officers.
Some of them were involved in the investigation of the corruption, focused on government officers of four ministers.
In July, a number of Turkish police were arrested for data organizing a criminal gang and telephone audience.
The Turkish president Recept Tayyip Erdogan (at that time the President of the Government) signed their negotiations as part of the action of the Islamic Spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all the children returned to the school to Ukraine.
The majority of schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (1 September) after the years' vacation.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the president of the Government of Arseny Jaceňuk brought his daughter to school.
At this occasion, he communicated to the present journalists that not all schools were re-internaled, but that it was decided to protect the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools, the traditional ceremonie was performed to 1 September.
Not throughout Ukraine, there's peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the United Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukov, a school teacher in Slovenia, visiting Jaceňuk's daughter, talked in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace reached and that children will gain the advantages that will be beneficial for them in the future.
By the day of the school they are traditionally celebrated so that children are dressed, bringing balloons and giveing flowers to the teachers.
At Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for difficult times
There is a cloud of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal concerts to preserve the party.
She has experiences from the front lines.
The carrier started in the Bain and Co constant company, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Medical World of Pearsons.
Seven years was the Executive Director Financial Times, which was rejected when the highest in the mother company of Pearson's concealed her youngest colleague.
It seems that her distance was near to a million liberals.
Her political portfolio is also broad.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former BP director when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: it became an adviser of the Government.
Her husband is a former member of the city Council.
In May, I described the work of the manager as a cattle with the eating.
Not only that the BBC is a broad and spent entity in the center of public life, but there is also a internal paradox in its structure.
Corporation turns into two directions: inside the top level of the BBC's own leading hierarchy, but also out to the public's voice in the periods of uncalledness when things do not work.
It's an inconsistent monopol that requires a reasonable reform.
But the manager would risk that he would come into a company complicated as a Chinese dinasty, distribute it and then prepare himself for work.
It's a hard call.
If it wasn't so hard, many people would see how BBC decreases - her power, her finance - and how its status is revised.
With the extension of the competition area and the new doubt of old certainty, there is a big danger without negotiating concesionary payments for BBC.
By a modest amount of 145,50 li per year, the British public purchases a share in something that certainly is the biggest media business worldwide.
BBC reports good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households and each one is only 40 pentions daily.
Furthermore, the BBC's benefits are obviously decreased: 53 % of the beneficiaries exceeding 31 % ten years ago.
The BBC services models have changed: Today newspaper titles are shown to me on the mobile phone and on the order I've been able to look at iPlayer.
But BBC continues to remain a very loving and lowly institution.
He needs a electr-- I hope she's found one.
Texas's Perry's teacher claims that a wretchful twitt did not approve
Tweet from the official Twister of the Texas Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained a worrying image of the Democratic State representative who initiated Perry's offence for the disuse of power.
Tweet was subsequently deleted and on Perry was published another one that was from the previous distance.
I've left a twitt that wasn't authorised.
"I don't agree with the two, and I got it," he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants did not respond to questions immediately.
Although the twitters were sent from Perry's officiality, it is not the one who is responsibility for his administration.
Previously, twitt published an unfounded, humorous image of the State representative of Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, which was sentenced in April 2013 for drinking.
When she refused to reject, Perry refused to pay ́s payment for her office, which Perry, perhaps the candidate to the president in the elections of 2016, brought this month before a large report in Austria.
The description in the Twitter stated: "I'm not driving with three times higher alcohol in the blood than the limit is allowed... but if so, I'm regreting Perry's responsibility for this."
I'm the greatest democracy in Texas.
The Lehmberg's office was not conducted in the investigation against Perry.
He was concerned with Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonia, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry was searched for innocent and the accusation was called a tactic, political manevre.
His disabled legal team requested the judge's supervisory case to refuse the accusation, because the use of laws for the execution of the court of the service officer in the Texas History is contradictive.
Perry suspended the payment of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the department of public interest that has a seat in Travis County and runs a corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to reject.
The refusal caused the formal complaint of the left-oriented group of civil activists.
Perry's official's active - and sometimes it's glorious.
After the end of his presidential campaign in 2012 in Job in the fifth place in the committee of his side, Perry replied on speculating that he could already finish, twitter with his own course running near the lake, and said: "This is I, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the market with residence returns "to normal"
One of the most prominent London developer companies warned that the market with residence in Southeast England “returned” to the normal level of activity.
The residence in the main town was the subject of high requests and growing prices and the increased concerns of the credit bubble were allowed in June Bank of England to introduce limites to hypoteques.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, the founder and president of the Berkeley Developing Company, said: “From the beginning of the current budget year, the market from the top point in 2013 returned to the normal level of transactions." It adds that it provides “stable for functioning”.
The London market with residence was well done during the destruction, because boughters were driving into the main town.
According to the catastrophe official data, only in the past year, the price in the city was 18,5 %, with the average of 6,7 % in England and all Wales.
The average sales prices of the private, available and student residence from Berkeley were about five years ago and at the end of April were spent to 423,000 pounds.
Nevertheless, because of the strengthening of libras, they have not been so attractive in the past months, some of them have also threatened the introduction of new taxes of unnecessaryness and the possibility of "seat-days" with which politics have come before the next parliamentary elections of May.
The London Reality Office Foxtons last week warned that the April review of the market with hypoteques, which represented more deeply loan rules, was also slow during the second half of the year in the market growth in the sales of inability and prices.
The new Bank of England showed a decrease in a quantity of approved hypoteques in June, which indicates that the market with residence is quiet.
Hamptons International, another reality officer, decreased on the basis of that the prices of homes have already started to decrease, its predict to the growth of the prices of Londres injustices for 2015 to 3 %.
The volume of transactions, according to the reality office WA Ellis, was decreased each year in London's lowest quarters such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
However, a request for residence in the main town for Berkeley was a blessing because it increased the preparation for the forward sale for more than 2,2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “The purchase after the right, well-like residence in the good place remained the same and the forward sale was maintained."
In June, the company announced that from the beginning of the year to the end of April, it sold 3 742 incapacities, a third more than before the top of the crisis in 2007.
Annual winning has increased by 40 % to 380 million pounds, by 18 % to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before the annual meeting, Pidgley said that the Berkeley annual outcome would be in accordance with the current market expectation.
Analysers agree that the annual winning before the transmission will be 450 million pounds.
The Berkeley action was stopped at the London Burg on the afternoon at 23,96 litres.

Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that the speaker of the pop stars Ariana Grande claimed that information photos would be true.
Excellent show of the New Roman Howard Jacobson on love and letter “J”
They're disappointed, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually divided themselves as a carton box that someone left on the rain.
Only from time to time, a woman told him that she was too serious, difficult, lasting, isolated, and maybe a little vulnerable.
And then she cut his hand down.
He's allowed it to be quietly.
He was able to kiss like a bullet, yes.
The final sacrifice of this ability was a starting loving floor, which had more than usually promised to take him away from a single life - suffering and may also provide him with such satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a crystal nice with a wild hair and a crossing heart from the village to the northern island, which was even far far off and unhost than Port Reuben.
On the south, the elderly partners of Kevern believed that her tante, who inherited the property in a low, but beautiful valley called the Paradise valley.
There's no one in the house for a few years.
The tubs were prosecuted, in the vans were dead pauses, as if they thought that the place belonged to them, the garden was grown, and the flood was in the great heads of grass.
The house looked like a chaloup of children's stories, anxious, and almost exciting, with a garden of full secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose roman «J» is on the preliminary list of nominations on Man Booker Price 2014.
A better choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on a long-term wooden cross and holding their hands, enjoying unexpected warm jail afternoon, unexpectedly loading the public station that the country had a comfortable music and a calm newspaper when he remembered the old song of a forgotten black comic, which was always listening to his father's roles.
You have too big feet.
Because of their natural aggressives, such songs have no longer played.
They were not banned -- they were nothing prohibited -- they were just not playing.
They helped them get into a decade, just as the word of the decade is alone.
The people's whisper proved that they could never have rules and positions outside the law, and as people in the books choose memories in which the poor becomes rich, cooking, and beloved Romans, so in music the balls are chosen.
Kavern left the day and started playing on the imaginary plane and a gross voice, and with a comic voice he sang a serien of Ailline's big walks.
It's a no-case.
"It was a favorite song from the jazz pianoist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father did when he wanted to cut the letter j before he went out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was still small.
Father told him he played the game with his father.
When you're in the words that started on j, you didn't get two fingers before your mouth, you're worth the money.
It wasn't too funny that time, and it wasn't even now.
He just said that it was expected, it was all.
He had to explain what it was.
Ailinn never heard anybody.
Not I, even if it wasn't directly set out outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvization went out of the mode.
There was only one "if".
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to find out where they'd end exactly.
That's the same in the humor.
His invisibleness came to the people in nerve.
And I was the humor of a loud song.
Although he did not hear about Sammy Davis Junior until ten years, Kevern knew the jazz of his father's local CD collection.
At least, but he didn't have to tell Aillin that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her mother, she could not remember the time when the favorite songs were not black.
No law or pressure, too.
The Free Society is the one in which each part of it with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who were happy insurance - agrees with the principle of the group of thanksgiving.
People of the African Caribbean psy with temperament and constitutions for the bathroom and the athletic, so they sang and walked.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as the nature of electricity delivery, took responsibility for no family without phone.
The Poland who remained was the installers, the Greek who remained, the missing vessels.
Those of the Persian Valley and Levant, whose parents did not leave the land while it was what it was, when it was TO TO - feared that they would be accused of joining them into the fire, feared in fact that the fire was the next hole - they had cut off the restaurant where he sold the labs and smoke the water smoke, not watching themselves, and the inactivity was slowly feeding them.
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballaad, Ailinn was hard to understand how the simple words that Kavern just sang could come out of music.
Music was the exposure of love.
"There are not simple," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people who have too big feet.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song had a chance.
He was talking too, but the deceased garden was providing an illusion of security.
Besides sound sheets, the word could not be avoided.
Ailinn still doesn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say that it was funny, but he was trying to give two fingers back in her presence.
She already thought she was wonderful.
"He seemed fun," he finally said.
She incrediblely cut her head and shaded Kever's view.
In the whole world, there was nothing other than the covering of her crazy hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she doubtfully said.
But it still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She looked very disappointed.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She did not walk so completely.
Maybe a little kitchen...
You say you hate me because I've got too thick kidneys?
I hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too quick.
"Your hot kids just attach me," he tried.
I'm so nice.
That didn't happen.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got it into the mood, because, as his father, he was driving a cup needed to be able to decrease the cruelness that he had in the shoes of the chip.
Maybe his father was cruel intentionally.
Maybe he was prominently cruel Kavern.
Despite the good eyes.
Ailinn Solomons' shot and lifted up from the bed, matched and broke out the wine.
Besin's wine, so it couldn't be drinking for it.
She seemed to be in her disgrace, like palm sheets in the storm.
"I'm disgustingly attractive that you're stupid," she said...
Well, it doesn't touch me.
He was sorry, as well as because of his ungrateful words, so because of the fear she had in her eyes at the moment when she stood against him.
Did you think she'd agree with her?
She didn't talk to him about life on a cold northern half of the island where she was growing, but she didn't doubt that it was the same thing in the foundations as here.
The same wide and ice ocean was stuck about them.
The same reminders of men, then, CO SE STALO, even more incredible and more furious than their forefathers, herories and cazistors, were inflammated from the economy to the economy, prepared to stretch out the hand on any woman who would refuse or laugh.
Blbec?
If they don't care, they'll lead their feet!
First to anointed her - the anointed became the most current expression for herotic distress between husband and wife: the opposite of the mild ballads of love that he had broken - first they anointed her, then eat one murder.
According to Kever's opinion, too culturality, because it was a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons told him to leave.
He got up from the bed as an old man.
She felt hungry, but the deepness of her sorrow surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know.
She looked out - as if she had seen him from the window in the watch -- a man who had found what he had caused himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
He's getting the heart stuck because of him and because of all men generally, no matter what a couple of them killed her.
The man turned away from her, his arms, shameful, deceived, all the fight left him - why did she seem that this view well knows, even though she couldn't get out the only moment until today she had ever seen it?
Ailinn Solomons, again, looked at her feet.
Nearly twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, a 20-year-old research working in Ofnow, the statutory monitoring system of the public relief, prepared a short article on the survival of light and medium-swerm violent acts in the country where it was mixed or directly stopped, mostly expected to have been found enough money and energy on its removal.
“It has been done so much and much more to do,” she wrote, “to calm up the natural aggressiveness of people who were fighting in many battles and gained a lot of them, especially in the difficult places of the country, where, even through the spices of the churches that appeared on the living areas of human kindness of history, it was rarely. ”
Some things, however, are unreplaceable.
It might seem to be the higher than the church, the lower is the pudding.
Inhabitants breathe over emotional balades, rejoice in disturbing stories and declare that they are strong in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that old brutality remains as strong as in urban aglomerations, but evidence also shows that at home, in the workplaces, in the streets, and even in sports games is a new and attacking hatred.
"Therefore, you have tend to be too florated," said her superposed.
I'd like you to read less Romans.
I'm Nusbaum's head cut off.
I have to ask, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to answer it," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesb?
Esme again threatened her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Next quiet.
"I don't ask me why," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I should have something against atheists, lesbs or feminists.
We don't have any prejudice on this job.
We're serving an unsupported company.
But some kind of oversensitivity, which is completely acceptable and grateful about himself, may sometimes draw the judgment as you predicted it.
Obviously, you are preached to the church - things that you call "great" and "brutal" others could also interpret as the expression of natural power and energy.
Continue to resolve what happened when it happened, as if it had happened, yesterday, it prepared the land with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
After his head on the light table, the recommendations that Ofnow sent to the world in the last fourteen or more years.
Laugh on your neighbor, care about your partner, listen to the balls, come to the musicians, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, excuse.
Speaking is better than silence, the song word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I understand completely your recompense," Esme Nussbaum replied silently when she was sure that her superposed ended, "and I do no longer say that she didn't hurt as we hope that she was deceived.
My concern is, in particular, that if we are warned about this, we repeat the same error that led to what it happened when it happened.
But this time we're going to ventilate on the rest.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingers of his fingers.
That would mean an unnecessary patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when the steps that may have been done and may not have done your parents, you're described as a mistake.
You're too far in talking about the ventilation of their "speak" and "uncertainty" on "others".
I shouldn't want anyone in your place to understand the past, and in the protection of the presentation, we will not talk about "we" and "they".
There were no "we" and no "they".
We only know that it was a chaotic time.
“When we are sincere to ourselves, ” Esme gathered courage, “No one is innocent.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it's just or not what happened, it's happening.
That was before.
It's not what to add -- we agree together.
And just as there is no guilt that would be given to someone, there are no things that should be done, neither if the correction was suitable and possible.
But what else is the past than that, and they learned from it?
The past exists, and they forgot it.
If I can add something to that...
Luther Rabinowitz solved the fingers of his fingers.
"Your message will be taken into account," he said and left it.
On the day when she went to work as a customer, the motocyclist hit her, who put it on a traveler in a way that the rounds described as “brutal and furious”.
The accidents will be able.
The Army of the Kingdom of Lesoth claims that no army plans - the President of the Government remains in South Africa
The soldiers of the Kingdom of Lesoth emphasized that they would organize a band for the government's decree, and they claimed that they acted against the police of suspects from the attempt to weapons of political fanatics.
The president of the government of Thomas Thabane fled from the country and said that the army surrounded his official seat and conceived government buildings in the main city of Maser.
After he declared that he was threatened by death, the Prime Minister took his family to the neighborhood of South Africa.
The speaking army Major Ntle Ntoi said that it wasn't the gun, but the answer of the army to the "political fanatics", which the police tried to arm.
"The Government of the Defence Components of the Kingdom of Lesotha today acted after a number of reports received of the information service that in a number of police groups planned to army some radical, political fanatics who wanted to be made in the country," said the vote of America.
The speaker of the South African government said that military action looked like an attempt to deal with the government.
"Although no one has declared that the government's power has been captured by power, the lesoth defence components are, according to all, to the action of the lesoth defence components of the state defence mark," he said.
The military representatives of the kingdom of Lesoth said that soldiers returned to their cazars on Sunday and the main city was calm.
During the Thaban's inadequacy, the Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane announced that, according to his opinion, it is a hard attack because of my attempt to fight corruption in the country.
Since June Thabane has stopped the Parliament's meeting on behalf of internal disputes, he has held the pressure in Lesoth.
He announced that despite the opposite statement, he doesn't bury his government.
Country in euro is at a minimum of 13 months
The growth of the production, according to the deeply followed investigation in August in the euro, was delayed to a minimum of 13 months.
The final index of shopping managers in euro (PMI) from June 51.8 decreased to 50.7 in August.
The number above 50 means expansion.
The new negotiations and manufactures have harmed the growing pressure between the EU and Russia for Ukraine.
Numbers shall be entered from the Quarter Meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets will want from the bank a plan to arrange with the remote healing of the euro and with the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
Speculations were shown that the Director of the ECB Mario Draghi may have indicated that this week he considers the quantity of the euro release, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States have arrived during the financial crisis.
"Although at least a growth is better than any growth, a heavy effect that has growing economy and geopolitical insufficiency to the manufacturer is still more visible," said Rob Dobson, the main economy of Markit.
The German SMEs, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 11 months 51.4.
In the second largest area, France, SMEs fell on 46.9.
Anxiety is about France, Italy has returned to the expansion of the stagnation.
The knowledge that the movement of growth in the most important industrial in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared is also not too quiet," Dobson said.
The slowness of the industrial will probably add to the fire analysis expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax stimulations.
One position of the report came from the Republic of Ireland, where SMEs increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economy in IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing is to be done about the production of the purchasing managers for the sword is to say is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
Added: The employees in the euro have a very difficult life at the present, because the increased geopolitical pressure - mainly between Russia and Ukraine - adds to the continuing increasing submissions in many countries.
This increased incidence of trade has proved to be evident - and mostly the trust of the consumers, which will probably cause some claims to be released or even cancelled, especially the costs.
He noted that as “although more likely” it appears that the ECB will finally have to carry out a quantitative release form, “although we expect that it will be just adequate”.
Ten years of hell of survivor: Ten years of fear from occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, Czechical radicals at school in South Russia were arrested as hands for thousands of people
More than 330 people, of whom more than half were children, were killed during suffering three days and that shocked the world
We returned to the scenario, and we looked for some of the victims that were avoided by death during the beast in school.
Exactly ten years after the disturbance of the school in ́lana, where 334 people died at 186 children, warned the heroes last night before the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they arrested and killed the fancy of the terrorist children and parents, it seemed to be the deepest end of the hell.
The opposite to the tragedy was the east and the west, which led to action and future in this disaster accident.
After ten years, we returned to South Russia, and we looked for some of the victims that were avoided by death during the beast in the school.
We have found young people who have suffered unfortunately, even though the raising to the hell caused terrorists in them will continue to live.
What is their biggest desire?
That the war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children as they were died - has already ended.
A girl trying to go from a devastated school body
It was captured by the Russian first photographer Dimitria Beliakov, as only in the bottom floor trying to go into a bombed school body after the bomb was exploded.
Lady Aida was looking for her mother, Lariss, who is now 40.
They were afraid they were both dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to flee and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida that time.
I had my feet from blood.
I got up and walked out of the cup to find my mom.
The soldier saved her.
After some operations, she thought she had been fully healed, but yesterday she said: “The pains returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take another operation.
I've got a kidnapped kids in my knees.
Her goal is to be a teeth to help people as doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it has certainly not destroyed it," she decided.
"I just got it, and it can't change.
Once a year, I'm going to the bodymate to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
This pain is too big.
My best friend and the future partner of Jer Gapoe's class killed there.
As small, we played together and imagined how we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to give up until I finish the school and start the career.
I'm going to think about the family.
She says she wasn't forgotten to get in prison, but it's a little bleeding every year.
I'm sure that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we're very thankful for the help we received from British and other countries.
When I look at the Internet, I say I'm going to see it first, they'll understand the disaster and threaten it to repeat.
The boy who was driving the rain and believed his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (the children begin in Russia in seven years) and survived the three-day school divorce in the subject of his mother Tamary.
At that time, the seventy-year-old said, "Mammy told me if the explosion had come, I had to sleep on the ground and keep it in my hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Return."
He was afraid that he was dead, fled, and saw the paying bottles on the road, fell down the child's hand, and they fled the bullet.
His father Vladimir, who catched him outside, said, "Give me that his mother was dead."
He says, "I couldn't save her."
At Vestia, Tamara came to freedom and lies in the hospital with a hurt leg, and she thought her son was dead.
After their meetings again, she said: “I wept happily.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and took me.
Da's later flying to London (based on the news of the World), where he was the former Prime Minister Tony Blaire and his wife, Cherie, announced by Bernardo's Children.
"The fear comes back every day, but I would like to stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the springs are already flat.
I remember that I've put all my guns on play right afterwards.
But today I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I don't have any problem with it.
"I don't be afraid to go from the bodymate, but I don't think of myself.
I'm taking the kids with whom I played in the court and who didn't get out.
We never say they killed or they died.
We're saying they've stayed in the body.
To go to London, I remember well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted and how I went to the cabriolet.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where he and his friends suffer as he suffered because of war.
The fear comes back every day, but I'd like to stop thinking about it.
"I'm very sorry for everyone who has to take such a fear," says Dahá, who has participated in voluntary activities in the class last week.
It's terrible to help.
I want to work at the police once, and I hope they'll take me to the academia next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no kids who would cry and run here, and it was quiet for a few months.
Lifely, he remembers the way with Damire to London.
When I told our story in London, people wept.
Then I realized how people on the other hand of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was thankful to Cherie Blair and her opinion for the granted price and for the opportunity to go to London 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say personally, even though it's ten years old, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how Da and I have helped me and Da.
I'm looking at how Da's got a shot at the bar, and so they called all Russian restaurants.
I also remember how he played with the chickens in the restaurant, Da's shot them from the water gun and they fled and played with him.
And it was just a month from that fear.
I was surprised how the Brits wanted to share with us about our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed to better in these ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it was, and there's still a lot of kids killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think war is just something in the reports they'll hear when they're hurt or when they're doing something else.
I know what people's going to do with you, what it's for fear.
I still feel that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so cruel.
That has grown up and is from nice and quiet boy, not at all aggression or excited.
For example, he doesn't complain after the consequences, but this doesn't care about him.
I know he's not likely to do that, but he's very close to six fellows, and he's coming into the body and burning the lamps there.
When he was smaller, he had problems with that -- I'm getting up how sometimes he slept on a cock with his face turned away from us and sometimes lied so hours.
Don't sleep, he had open eyes.
I remember too that he's cut off all his weapons or other weapons on play. Da'a is 17 today, is higher than I, beautiful, smart and healthy.
I can believe that I was sure for a few hours he's dead and I'm never seeing him anymore.
When I remembered and stood up on my feet after the explosion, I looked around, and saw that hell, and the human body's kiss were all over.
I was absolutely sure my boy had no chance to survive this hell.
“I remember how I cried, ‘Damire, run, run!’, but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and fled.
So our life goes away from the other sides.
Ilyin Grigory, 17
The boy whose ownership after an attack became a symbol of fear in the face
Reconfort: Overleving from Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatimou after attack in 2004, Gregory today
When he fled for his life after the Czech terrorist shot his fellow servants, he was a crushed fear in his bloody face.
His maid was one of the most shocking symbols of the beast.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, set him at school at the first day and quicked her older son Vladimir at the university.
"I went two minutes before the terrorists dropped into the court, so my boy stayed there three days alone," she arose.
Not completely alone because we had family there, but everyone died there.
He just survived my Grigory.
As the date comes near, it is even more difficult to think about it and talk.
It's not the only day, and they didn't see the tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time ago, I feel that it was yesterday, some moments I'm still going back.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Continuing to return: Photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was evaluated as socha (right)
I'm looking forward to how the day Grigory was very happy at school, he said he wanted to take his teacher.
That he's alive, I learned when I saw him in the television.
In San Marino, there's even the socket of the paying Grigory.
Grigory's looking at this cup, and we've saved it in the bookbook at home.
I understand, but I also think that through that image people around the world think of the pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important to not repeat this.
“I doubt we will sometimes learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still investigating, but no one will ever discover the truth.
Now they're investigating this boeing hawair in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what was the cause?
This world's waiting for something too bad.
"I don't understand why, because when people ask, no one wants war as possible?
There's nothing for that pain for ten years.
And at least a little forgotten, for tens of years.
It had a effect on my health, I still feel it.
I had three or four years to attack the night morning, but then it improved.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and friends who killed.
That's why, when he's close to 1 September, I'm going to the body.
Just honor the memory of your children's friends.
It's hard for me to enter the body, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is the past.
I won't forget that, but I don't.
My life's going on.
This year, I finished the school and started studying the doctor at the University of Vladikavkaz.
It's a cardiochirurg.
First I wanted to enter the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but because of health, I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Gregory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, although they kept him at the feet of a murderer terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderer terrorist, yet he was able to survive
When the attack was in full run, he was arrested in the body, sitting near the bomb at the feet of a murderer terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"We feel like it was yesterday," said Gregorius, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service Agent, but because of the damage he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I've put on my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that children with bad experiences can get better - I need to say that it's not true.
“In 2006, I went to psychology and then was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd never forget.
In 2005 - the following year - it was the first and the last thing I went into the body again.
I'm stuck.
I'm never going there again and don't want me to show you where I sit on this well known image.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on the notebook with his photos made in the hospital after attack
This pain is great and I don't get it with you every day.
Friends think I don't like to think about it or talk and never ask me at school.
With regard to physical health, I'm okay.
I have to be careful about my gentlemen I've hurt, but I'm already walking normally.
But even because of health, I couldn't stop and study the FBS academy in Petrohrada, as I wanted.
I sent my documents to them with medical reports, and they told me that it was impossible.
My next love is animals, so I've been throwing to the veterinary.
I've been there the second year.
It learns how to treat all animals from “coat after cow”.
He said: “I know that I never want my child to talk about it.
It's not something kids should think about, and they're not any more to live.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain will always be here.
He's inside, and he's worrying about the next year.
I'll participate in the ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for it, because he was there for a distance from me.
I waited home and couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful that he returned him to me.
It's left with us.
Gregory's adult today, but the fear's getting away.
It's hard to accept when something happens to you so badly injust.
He's a boy, he has a sport, but he can't do it because of his gentlemen.
He's running a few operations, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that I've already overcome the 50%, but to overcome it completely and not forget it.
This horrible experience will still be with us.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors killed, and the pain is just worse.
I lost a lot of people I had and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the biggest gift that God could give me, but the loss of killers is painful.
I know the family in which other children were born, but also the widows who did not get back.
It's hard to accept that life's going on, even if you don't want.
I will never forget how my heart almost sprang out of the throat when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world -- wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is now close to our country, and I can be able to believe.
In the past, we were a friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure there was a lot of kids in Ukraine and they're still killed.
When they could take all the rebels and throw them away, as far as it's going on.
Alyona Tscaeva, 10
Children brought to security special command
Saved: Allion Tskaeva is carrying into a secure Russian special command (left).
Now it's ten (right) and it doesn't see it on the tragedy.
In 2004, the world was captured after the breath when the small Alion was taken out of the Bosnian prison by the Russian police officer.
The terrorists left her, however, in prison in the school body, her thirty - year - old mother, a decade Christian sister and the brother of Makhar.
Makhar, who was three years old, avoided, however, the mother and sister of Allion died at the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan married again, and his new wife had a girl named Christin after the dead daughters.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, doesn't look at an attack, and she has grown up a big and happy girl.
A close friend announced that “is a great happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Russlan is a good father and wants children to keep away from the raising that he's ten years old.
You can understand why.

4 types of how to arrange better and videos under water
You're interested in focusing or driving under water, you have a large selection of equipment.
The most important options are compacts such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which cost about $300.
I arranged these photos for a family celebration of a few photos, all were less than $350.
It's one of the equipment you use, but the best results are applied to a number of rules.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a water camera, make sure the battery and other parts are closed.
Further set up the camera according to what type of photo or video you will be able to make.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenary or an adjustment mode that optimizes the exposure on dark under water.
And before you leave in it, see how deeply you can be disturbed with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only to 5 degrees, next to 50 to 60 degrees.
Read our fingerprint by purchasing and evaluation of digital cameras in running and waterful performance.
Make a few photos -- a lot of them will not go out.
Compact cameras have LCD that will help you with the composition of photos, but outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, it'll be wrong to see under water and the composite of the collection will be incredible.
So do more photographs.
It has a camera bracketing mode that makes a series of photos with a quite different exposure, use it.
Keep close to the level.
The deepest brightness of the light is expressed.
It is possible, keep on focusing in the basin, lake or sea near the level.
This will also enable you to catch on more lights -- with which you deeply get down, you will see less colours.
Get close to the photographed object.
It's a fine advice if you're on a dry, but under water it's even more important for the light of the light.
It is particularly important if you draw with the outdoor camera: Such equipment are usually a strong and wide angle of a bitch, which means that if you want to fill the photos, you need to draw closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality force could change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As anestesiologist, he dedicated his career to the pain of the disease and the treatment of the sick ones.
His wife stresses that one of those who were seeking his help was the MI6, who had to live with the results of the torture that made him frozen.
Lawson realized that while doctors focus on diagnosis and illness, patients treated in mildness carefully interested in something else: pain.
On one day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May that year.
I felt without energy.
He addressed the symptoms of the throat and found that he was not patient, and Juliet's wife includes the figures.
He said, "I want to do everything better than it's later."
When Juliet went on the service road a week, Lawson was unusual and unexpectedly disappointed.
Something was wrong.
His colleague made his rentge.
Once two weeks ago, he was lying in the French Al's Al's.
The results of the rentgen came.
He had a mizotelium, an unhealable box that has an inflammation or if a pulmonary exhibition.
It is hard to determine what was their cause for cancer species.
Although some kids get a lung cancer, not all patients with cancer pulmonary smoke.
Mezotelium is different.
However, in all cases it is the cause of the exhibition of azbest - the building material that was previously marked as “mirely” but today it is known that it is mortally dangerous.
For the most of us, it wasn't difficult to ignore mixers.
Asbest, finally, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbest in Britain has not been used since the 60th years when it has entered into force the prohibition of use of asbest in the industry.
Even in the time when asbest was used, only certain groups of people, such as isolation, builders, teachers and employers in ships, came to him.
Toxin used in industrial in another era is hard today seeming to fear.
But it's not in place.
As it is shown, the mezotelium epidemia is today in Britain.
The beginning of death on the mizotels is higher than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths for this illness are twice a year more than a number of victims of car accidents.
Beginning of death on the results of mezotelium annually since 1980 and estimated death in the future in Great Britain
Although the use of asbest is illegal for years (all types of asbest were finally prohibited by the law in 1999), it is usually a few decades before the mixers are developing.
The sepulchre in the form of mezotelium does not apply only to the veterinarians of the building industry.
Asbest was, and in many cases, it is still present in the houses in which we live, in the offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in business in which we buy.
Thus, it does not respect social levels, riches, calls or guards.
Privileged bathrooms from London business houses after public school are not hidden.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the storage of this mortal cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put the isolation.
He tried to find out where he could get contact with azbest.
Then he came to it.
"It is likely that a lot of azbest was in Guy's Hospital towns, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
Everyone - students, sisters, doctors and ports - used walks.
The question is how many of my moderns will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was the question he could have answered partly.
“For four doctors who were in practice in Guy's Hospital and who were in the past five years,” he noted in the letters in 2010, “I am the only one still alive.”
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was stuck with mezotelium when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
To survive with this diagnosis, it's not usual.
55 percent of people with mezotelium will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is mortal.
Now we can only ask Lawson, "How many of us are sick with the same disease?"
According to the former British expert at the mizothelies of Professor Julian Pet, the best estimation is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbest epidemic in Britain is played, about 90 000 people will die.
Most of them today have no idea that they will die in this way.
Azbest Dollar in Quebec, Canada
In the review of the lists of courts that often turn and require compensation, it shows how the mezotelionic coverage has increased.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that she had exhibited Janice Allena asbest.
She worked nine years for the string, from 1978 to 1987, when she watched two sales on a clothing section - one of the places was a flagship of the company, a trade at Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today, she's got two kids who's over twenty.
"Before it happened," he says, "I have never heard of mezoteleum before, I've just done something about asbest.
Never even in my dream, I thought he could have touched me.
There's not too many people who do something about asbest.
There's no azbest, but a group of six minerals.
The name was obtained by his fibrous structure, which gives him power and honor.
The six minerals were used in the building three.
Most often, in buildings today, there is potential of crisothy, runningly known as a white asbest.
It was used in the floor panels, underground walls, boiler sticks and even in the coast.
It is not as mortal as other forms of asbestos, however, the EU and the WHO consider it a "great health risk" that can cause death.
It is more dangerous but it is a noise azbest (mosit) and blue azbest (crokydolit).
British has ever been the world's biggest importer of nitrogen asbest and experts claim that “is a convincing but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of a high gain of mezotelium [in the United Kingdom]."
Lady Marsk & Spencer was set up asbest in a flag sale in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical sacrifice to mezotelious, but Julian Peta's work indicates that her story is not unusual.
His study of patients states that “the essential part of the cases of mezotelium without a known exhibition of asbest at work or at home was probably caused by the exhibition of azbest in ≥”.
A significant part of this exhibition is caused by “current use and lighting” of buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he's safe.
Goddard Consulting report, who examined the Westminster Palace, shows that neither people in the middle of the government have to think that they are possible to be exhibited asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that the service exemptions and trumpets were contaminated by asbest by the Committee's rooms, whose mortal flames could be violated by something such as “the powerful air stream”.
Ministers are often accused that they are only concerned about their own interests, but in this case it may be true.
Although the Government of the Parliament's Services continued to get the Westminster Palace “positive medical certificate”, it is now considered that it will need a million frees and a few years of work to be adequately reviewed, modernised electricity and removed asbest, and that, after the elections in 2015, the rapporteur will be more than on the Green Law in Westminster to sit in the areas of the Conference Centre of Algebra II.
The Goddar report states that “the presence of azbest is not in accordance with certain provisions”.
It's not possible to say if this unlaw will be life.
Everyone can just wait now.
One of the persons who never were able to determine when the exhibition of azbest occurred in them is Graham Abbott, doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) has a suspicion that asbest was exposed to the work in sicknesses.
"I worked in the hospital where the presence of azbest was demonstrated," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
Of course, but he remembers the day at beginning 2009 when he was capable of something like a winter.
He was 45, he was evening, and he was just at the operation.
I was broken up once.
It's been a crap.
I was terrified.
I thought I wasn't going home the car.
'Cause he was a doctor, he thought the pain was coming out of the cockpit, the exhibitions around the powder.
But just as Janice Allen hadn't supposed to think it was a mizotel.
He finally spent a month at home.
The doctors have made him a rentge of the cocktail and brought him a warm category to remove the liquid that they sent to the divorce from the powder.
However, they didn't determine diagnosis.
His state was slowly improved and returned to work.
But his symptoms have been returned from time to time, often after he was trained and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott patients with similar symptoms came to the operational salon and followed by mizotels.
But not even then Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was over a few decades older, and in his work he reached direct contact with azbest.
In this case, the community was connected.
In September 2011, Abbott's status was again worse and his doctor ended his photos from the CT and the rentgen with the expert panel.
In January 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he was in the space between the spring of the hot dust and the spring of the pulmonary sondae invoked by the camera.
I'm optimist.
I have the trend to take nothing too much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry about it.
But Rachel, my wife, did anxiety.
The results of the biopsie arrived between Christmas and the New Year: "They told me that it was a mizoter."
Graham Abbott: with mezotelium
Abbott started to meet sisters from the charitable organization of Macmillan, and one advised him to contact the lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the range of epidemies.
“The azbest was very useful, especially in large public buildings, often having a heat isolation of azbest in the trumpet,” he says.
People who have been built in these buildings of azbest are now starting to be sick.
Thus, the middle is now starting to apply younger people who have no risk calls.
The most dangerous tubes of warmly isolated asbest in diseases were injured in sutherene, so it was unlikely to threaten patients.
Of course, the members of the staff who passed by sutheren walks between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or eat in sutheren farms (as often Graham Abbott) have certainly come into contact with the toxic substance.
As shown now, some decades after the war of the hospital were places where patients could save life, but also places that could threaten the life of doctors who had treated them.
Asbest is removed to this day.
Bunsen's kids set up on asbest bases.
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbest was often used in offices, trades, books and advisers because of his excellent isolation and immortal property.
In school, too.
Many people have been designed asbestos in the school.
Sometimes, the chemical students built Bunsen's cahan on the azbest basement.
The websites were available with asbest issues in schools.
Injurious things such as the ground cowboys or the boxes of the tools in our homes were running azbest.
"It's about the industrial food built in a large quantity of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his complaint against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with the asbest that a woman had been able to remember with mizotelium, in the 70s of the warning of the garden house.
So take care of how you're driving the garden house.
I feel that the disease is untreated, the impact of diagnosis is great.
"It takes a while before it happens to you," Graham Abbott says.
I came back to work and tried to continue, but I found that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and arrange with myself.
Well, I don't get the next Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was a transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As an unfair quantity of patients before him, he also remembers how he felt deceived from the quantity of information that he had to organize.
"It was hard to understand all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I stay?"
I was told that twelve months.
I remember what I said: “Well, I don’t get to the next Christmas.
That's it."
Mizotelium is particularly devastating, because the mechanism of what keeps us in life -- a single breath -- is what causes cancer that kills us.
Most cases of mezotelious are caused by the exhibition of azbest.
Azbest makes small flames.
When the azbest is broken and the flames are breathed, they can be placed in the cotton, the pulmonary manufacturer.
Azbest flames travel and can cause mutation of cells.
"There are a problem with the inspired azbest flames in the face of a glass," explains Professor Tom Treasure, cardiochirurg, who was in Guy's Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exhibited asbest and which is paradoxly leading center in the treatment of mezotelium.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were probably exposed to azbest during the practice in the hospital.
Treasure says: “Some breathing is pressured on the border where the hall is located.
Their honor is from the beginning of invasion.
The current treatment options used for other types of cancer are not so high.
It is discussed, for example, about the ability of the operation.
Some of them said she would have been attempted.
Treasure fails.
"You can't remove the injury," he says.
You're not getting a scalpel around her.
Cancer “too doesn’t correspond to chemotherapy”, which even has“a effect ” but does not treat.
“ Sometimes somebody who survives cancer, ” says Treasure.
But finally everyone will die.
Unfortunately, some patients live longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half year from his own diagnosis Graham Abbott still fights.
After discovering mezotelium, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years ago from his diagnosis, became individual support and adviser for the same affected people.
When they called, he was glad to imagine: "Good day, you called to the centre of cancer."
“It was very positive”, says Abbott.
He was ill four years ago and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and probably would have longed his life for a month.
"I was missing," he says.
I wanted to give it.
But Lawson "he was able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treating with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the division of the hot surgery in Guy's Hospital hospital.
"I had the advantage that I had not to wait until I was sent to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," Graham admits.
The normal patient would have to get a bathroom and have to approve his replacement.
In order to achieve the best available treatment, the question of money is key for patients with mezotelium.
But when different treatments endlessly fail inevitably, many patients face another financial age -- the future of the family they leave here.
That's why they turn to courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse .P.
"From 1898, asbest is harmful for health," Morgan says.
However, in the 60s, it was found that its very small quantity could also represent a health risk.
And here we're meet with the lack of fire.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally were equipped, but Morgan said that it was not “full-valuable compensation” because Lawson could not definitively demonstrate that the mezotels were the result of the exhibition of azbest exposure in Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigation of the case, speaker Guy's Hospital confirmed that “the deterioration in the incriminated sutheren part was removed in the 90s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove azbest
To consider the exposure of a mortal asbest to one company or the place of work - usually decades after that - for patients with mezotelium seeking compensation was a serious problem.
A lot of former work has changed the owner or has decreased.
The evidence was lost.
And those who are now in charge of accusations have a time on their side, and their complainants do not determine.
In response to this year, a significant new legislation was approved, which is more easier for patients with mizotelium to make compensation, even if their former employee is not possible to monitor.
The Law has created a 350 million financial reserves building insurance and appointed by people after July 2012, which can prove that they have been exhibited asbestos, but they have no one to complain.
In such cases, 80% of the amount that the court would add to them as a compensation - approximately 120,000 pounds.
Each year, 300 successful demands are expected.
Andrew Morgan also thinks with mizotelio patients that 350 million pounds are "work".
"It is an agreement signed by insurance assurances," he says and points out that the sum is a quarter of what the assurances should pay if it doesn't take time and people with the mizote would be able to treat former employees and to demand them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister for Work and Social Affairs, admitted that the law had “scale”.
But Penning and Morgan admit that, due to seven deaths each year, it was necessary to negotiate.
"The people are too suffering and helping immediately," Penning said in the past year during the second reading of the law concerning mezotelium.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After the starting conferences, he recommended the Lang-Lazdunski operation, which he thought he would have a positive effect at the end of Toma Treasur.
After operation, radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed - three-three treatments in which Lang-Lazdunski may be stumbled with a measure of overliving five years to 40% of patients.
Abbotta has strengthened it.
"It is, of course, not the most important thing," says Abbott.
You still see that in patients.
There's something that hurts you.
When you get up, your status can be very worse.
Graham Abbott approached the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, the last of six cycles of chemotherapy ended.
Control reviews did not show any symptoms of disease.
I went to further control in March [2014].
I've had a few bullets [cacs] in the coat.
My fifty-first birthdays were just near.
It doesn't threaten this life.
Get it.
Abbott re-covered six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there are no traces in his body.
But it's physical and emotionally exciting process.
You have to think of practical things - for financial security when I die, or to show to the woman how the building works on the coat.
If you find bad reports, you will continue to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for the fathers of Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it is not easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After diagnosis, I said to the boys that my condition means that I'm never old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin's a lot of community and divoke.
She said it to friends, and suddenly we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more sustainable.
She didn't say so much.
All patients with cancer must be held in such conversations.
In patients with mezotelium, but such discussions are not reflected on a ≥ 2,0% or only on a sign of the chance of survival.
The disease with herself (and finally brought Stephen Jay Gould's) unpleasant security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "the mixers are not threatening life."
The bodies of Pharaoh's balls are packed into the asbest plague.
Asbest fibres are used to stick to the wheel and increase the opposition against the wheel.
Plinius Elder describes asbest.
It was found a weight that is unheavy.
I've seen her makers of her, and they've been thrown in the throat on the hotels.
In Italy, asbest begins to be found in commercial use, it is used to produce paper (a.k.a. banks) and weight.
Great asbest valleys are decorated in Canada and South Africa, soon then in America, Italy and Russia.
During the industrial revolution, it is an excellent isolation substance in couples of engines and turbines.
The world production of azbest is increased to more than 30 000 tonnes per year.
Insurance statistics of Prudential find more mortality in people who work with asbest, and they are then rejected.
In Rochdale, Nellie Kershaw dies.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that parts of azbest in her pigs were "without doubt the cause of her death."
This is the first case of this kind.
Carshaw's employees, Turner Bros Asbestos, reject the responsibility.
He's not paying any compensation.
During World War II, ships are intensely built, work in ships represents the highest risk of azbest exposure.
Prohibition to import blue asbest
The Revocation Court confirms the first successful complaint for the consequence of the exposure of asbestos in Britain.
The world production of azbest is increased to more than 4 213 000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Health and Security Constitution requires all asbestos suppliers to have licences.
Imports and uses of blue and furnace asbest are prohibited by the law in Britain.
In British, use of all types of asbestos is prohibited.
The United Kingdom shall enter into force the Mezotelium Law.
It's been launched a 350 million compensation programme.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, the white asbest continues to be used as a leaving building material.
World production is holding two million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose lead - demonstrators promise the vengeance
The Chinese Parliament, despite the numerous debates on the democratic reform on Sunday, decided not to enable electors in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will cause promised protests in Hong Kong's trade quarter, because the activists have started to organize and lose only a few hours after this notification.
China's human conference generally allows communist leaders to organize any candidate that is not loyal to Peking.
"We were not surprised, but we were disappointed," said lady Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
People in Hong Kong lying.
And it's fair that we have what to do with the authoritative regime.
On defence of the Chinese decision, the Secretary-General of the Standing Committee on the National People's Congress of Li Fei said that to enable public nomination in Hong Kong leading elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when British returned to China to Hongkong, Peking promises that in 2017, people will be able to choose exercise power.
The Chinese leaders presented a Sunday decision as a democratic front, because Hong Kong allows direct vote, but also shows that Chinese leaders are firmly held in the process of nomination of the committee, which is extremely controlled by Peking.
And, according to the new clause, only candidates will be allowed to "love the country and Hong Kong".
The decision came after the months of the year, which had been exchanged by one of the largest and most followed protests in Hong Kong for a few years.
For the democracy protests in Hong Kong, the Occupation of the Centre with love and peace, which the organizations have threatened to close the financial quarter if Peking does not give them the general voting right.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the notification, hundreds of Occupation movements in the rain were stuck before the seat of the Hong Kong government.
The organizations reported to the demonstration that their movement comes into a new stage of civil disobeyment and that protests begin in the next weeks.
However, they did not provide any other details, they obviously wanted to avoid the problems of the authority.
In their Internet declaration, the organizations said that the movement “was considered the occupation of the Centre only as a last step in the case of all the options of dialogue and will not have any other choice.
We have to notify with policy that today all the options for the dialogue have been exhaustive and the occupation of the Centre are inevitable.
The offices in Hong Kong were prepared for the notification of Peking all the days, and on Sunday, strengthened the protection of the government seat and distributed police and barikades.
Increasing disappointment is, according to many Hong Kong people, a sign of the loss of city control slowly.
The additive of peakin people increases competition in products and services.
Also, fear that values such as democracy and word freedom are increased by the pressure of Peking.
Some people criticize the movement of the Occupation of the Centre and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - a salvation of Hong Kong.
"The protest that he is talking about could cause much more economic damage according to how many people are involved and how," says Political Regina Ip, which is criticising at times.
We don't want to widespread fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such considerations could damage investment.
China's state media has also come to reports that democracy activists in Hong Kong are considered as a reverse agent in the west.
In the year of activists organized an official referendum on voting rights, to which 780 000 voters arrived - more than five electors in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in history.
Pre-elective agitics?
Liga in Jihlava has a name by political movement
A small coppa is playing in the town of Highshot approximately 1 600 amateur sporters.
And their highest competition is renamed Commonly for Jihlava liga.
The name was obtained according to one movement that goes to the October communal elections.
The tenth of his candidate is also the leader of the small buried in Jihlava Jan Dark.
"There was a wallet, where there was no problem with it," said the Dark.
Situation around the first small bottles had already been concerned by the lawyers of the Southern Council and recommended to change the award distribution system.
The small cave obtained a lone on the town's web about a million crowns.
This year's about the amount of hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, there is no process of small buried in contrast with the law or the Directorate's Directives.
The situation is, however, an adjustment rules for grants and awards for the Office," said the speaking director Radek Tulis.
It is probably no longer going to take up the city's contributions and expressed as a small buried support in the elections of one political side.
A similar demand from politics has not yet come to the high "great" ball.
It should be found by the CSSD national transmission, ODS division or KDU-COL 1.
And class and similar competition?
I wouldn't be for.
Instead, I would be worth if sponsors turned on us with a series of fires," observed the President of the National Bale Union Miroslav Vzzáček.
Chief of the small ball of the other side and movement in the name of the ligue shall not leave
According to players of small tombs, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six games, shoes and social equipment.
"For example, the crossing on Stoups is not our, we're in the procurement," warned Andrew Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most appropriate locality would be the Czech monkey.
But there, for example, will be built by my opinion, an insensitive area for scatters that are about fifty in Jihlava," he warned the Dark.
The primator Jihlavy Jaroslav Wymaszal (ODS) reacted that the small cow uses a cup with a artificial grass in the streets of Rossica and On Stoups, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a wheel that has a maximum use.
We wish to modernize or build sports at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon hours.
I think that for a little tobacco, he made a big progress in the last years," he added.
Other political parties in the names of the ligue will not appear according to John Dark.
We have a restriction.
We're not going to partnership with one of us, so we're not doing the other anymore," he explained.
"Politic movement in the name of the ligue, I think it is at least an unfortunate step," said the member of the Working Committee for Sports Karel Voldán.
"But let the electors appreciate whether Mr. Dark uses together the Small Jihlav's grave and the touching of the city for the political areas, or not," he added.
America's tradition goes into a university life - the first can fly a trish aircraft
We are thinking we can answer the request by launching the first luxual way of service for students in Britain.
After leaving the best income at the arrival to the university, the company also offers the possibility of transport for a private driver or vehicle type Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P.
Stewart also announced that the service has its security site.
Service is the ideal option for students who would otherwise have to talk about their stuff throughout the entire state in a dangerous car.
We are pleased that with our VIF (very important fresher - very important elements) the students in this year will make sure that they will come to the university with the minimum nervosity and the maximum luxus.
The speaking company said that because the service had already been released, they have no reservations yet, but he added: “The students will continue to make reservations during a few weeks.”
The company also noted that although students pay a yearly school at 9000 pounds, she expects the market service to find its place.
In comparison with students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, students today are different about expectation and desire - it is more important than ever to make the right first idea and the VIF program is exactly the appropriate way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, but the service was criticized as an inevitable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is inappropriate.
Many students who are going to the university in this month must be equipped with the financial crisis because available financial aid in the form of loans and grants is not able to keep a step with the costs of the basic needs.
Feminists stand against racism and behavior of the police after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of a month, he killed a police officer in Ferguson in Missouri.
The presents waiting for the sepulchre with their hands up scandal: "Do not shoot up!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, because of the shooting of the unarmed young man Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoil Perez was mentioned in the Internet discussions of white feminists.
She concluded that when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and equality of revenue, white feminists preserve race sex.
With the growing pressure on the Mediterranean, which reached the attention of the national pressure, Perez noted that the reaction of the white is 100% concentrated on the race.
In comparison with the reactions of the black boy soon after shooting 9 August, personal articles with the headings such as "the thought of the white over Ferguson" or "Feminismus not only on the damage" were reported relatively late.
But, according to Perez, it represents a significant change.
"I think there are not too many people in the feministic movement who would talk about race and privileges in such a level," she declared.
People felt that what happened had to be exhausted.
For the crisis we face is characteristic, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially obliged that they have to warn about it.
According to the professor of English at the State University of Ohiu Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson expressed the problems that African people must face every day and which are not considered as “women's questions in the cultural field”.
"I can publish funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and get 150 people from people around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about that bars are in their own country in the sand, it's quietly proclaiming.
"How can a woman be able to speak publicly about issues, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black people like Mitchell, who were concerned about the question of race, sex and sexuality in the American history, it does not exist between the race and the gender of dictatory.
The black ones, according to it, could not allow luxury to divide these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white people today coincide with the question of race and gender in mainstream feministic cross, Angela Hattery, professor who is a woman's question and a gender study to George Mason, says that their preachers did opposition.
between 1865 and 1890, at least 10 000 black men were linched and the d' had been in all cases of the violation of whiteness," said Hattery.
You needed to cooperate with white people in order to deal with the linen.
According to Hattery's division between white and black, he came when warriors for election right such as Susan B. Anthony studied at the end of the 19th century the territory and realized that the electoral right could only have one group of people - women or black.
"They have decided to put cards on the voting law for women and on the right of black people to deal with," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important view of why the colorful women don't believe white women.
We didn't take a good job.
We never helped the black people to protect their husbands and children.
Even after women received electoral right in 1920, there were ten years before they began to organize the linching in the Southern Women's Association for the preliminary linen.
The group arose 40 years after the black boys first told them about help.
According to Mitchell's rebellion to the reaction of white feminists to the questions in Ferguson - the question of behavior of the police, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "do" the issues with which the black people were dealt with.
"It would not be wonderful if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] took the right to educate the child as seriously as they took the right to anticonception?", said Mitchell.
The second feminist wall, who made a fighting career for reproduction rights and access to anticoncepts, now find out what it means.
Excellent feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after the shot of Michael Brown by Facebook attack, where the column of Rebecca Carroll from Guardian, which requested the white Americans to protest racially against racism.
"I hope that women who have different, but yet the dangers of the company - and the views of race that are very different in the public opinions - will strive to change," said Steinem.
Despite Steinem's intersectional feminism, which includes the issues of race and gender, her comments on the question of race in America some people are killed.
The American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book "Who stealed feminism?", said for She The People that young men in the United States, especially young bar men, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but the comments of the Steiner Party of Ferguson are critically criticized before.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but no one for boys.
But when the White House started a small program My Brother's Keeper, which had to help the vulnerable young black and His's, it was in many feminists of Glorie Stein's disappointed reaction.
The police to the Black Community is not the only problem that faces the interest of the mainstream feminism.
After the United States Police held this year on the southwest of the country, at least 63,000 youths without prejudice, the question of the reform of immigration laws - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercadova, co-president We Belong Together, a mobilizing women for the reform of immigration laws, said that the question could be raised as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was to share the stories of the immigrant.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado says.
Since the majority of work permissions will be granted to men, women who will come with them will become in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and disuse.
"These stories have a voice in women's organizations," she said.

After heat in the lottery, Harvey's city on the southwest of a fresh millioner.
The lottery player in Harvey will get a million.
He's going to watch the new millioners in the south-east of Perth, one happier from the Sabbath lottery rents $1,1 million.

But the honest exhibitor has to log in first.
Steve Forward's business owner said that the whole city is talking about the excretion in the Southeast of Perth.
It's the main subject, and everyone's disappointment.
We thought a similar winning was to touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia were divided by one trial last month, which ended a few happy weeks.
Last week, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five August billioners and just a few weeks ago a couple of incredible dollars in Belmont.
The victory two had 20 years and said that the winning would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.

Machine drivers want higher sales
GDL in the print statement signed a protest for a warning station for which he approved the time outside the transport puzzle.
At the selected time, GDL takes regard to many people who return from weekend after the railway to the first working day.
In addition, we also think about people who come for work during the day," the committee's union stated on Monday in the print statement to report the staff.
"Our first staff should be in the main cost transport, less traveling," GDL added.
DB has not yet published official reactions to the statement of the staff.
There is not even aware how the protesting action will touch international railway connections, otherwise with the Czech Republic.
The committees require an increase in machinery cost of five per cent and a reduction of work for two hours a week.
The average payment of machinery is currently moved, depending on worked years between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) annually.
DB drivers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to access payment growth when decreasing work.
They emphasize, however, that the remuneration of machinery evaluation must be developed as in the final rail staff where DB is not calculated by working week-up.
It was threatened that Christ's car would start burning.
That's why Barum rallye ended
What exactly happened?
It was about the material leader.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like that could happen.
Didn't the output be done and continue in the service at the latest time, where would the mechanisms change it?
When they moved right there, yes.
But we've been waiting for two other hersets and wearing it.
There's a high temperature in it, and the risk that the car would start burning was big.
I can't let it.
In full time, you've been doing five tests.
What did you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like a whistle.
We were lucky, but I didn't go through the guilt.
Everything was caused by the car we piped over half a year to be at the same level.
The testimony showed that it happened to us.
You divorced him so you could really think of victory.
I prepared myself and my car so we had the reality.
The job wasn't coming in the morning.
On the other hand, the outcome that we could think about was not left.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technology said no.
You weren't the only one of the pigs who had previously departed from the battle of primacy.
They were also out of the westfathers of Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Did you surprise that so many favorites went away?
Yeah.
Mostly, it was damage for the whistle because the train has been over before.
On the shot also moved Jaromir Tarabus, whom you want a car.
But he's been paying for it to go out of the trace and getting a two-minute miss.
How did you be satisfied with his performance?
It's damage because he could have re-congratulated a degree of winners.
Well, he's spent the first time.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was good.
He's gone a lot.
Just a year ago you announced the end of the career, however, you appeared raally at the start of Barum.
Can you have a good feeling of the chess again to make a regular Rally traveller?
I'm sure not at this moment.
Loni, I said Barumka was my last train, and I didn't do it.
I decided I'd go to her again.
It was my nineteenth start now, and if there's a chance again in a year, I'm going to it.
But I don't think about anything else.
So many people have come to trace only because of you.
Did you rejoice?
In some way, we started just because of them.
A lot of people known or unknown, she still asked if I would go.
I wanted to make them glad.
What's waiting for you after Barumce?
The team's going on.
Next week we'll go to Wyskava, where Robert Adolf's going.
I hope he didn't hurt the car here too much.
Moreover, he wants to pay the Honza Sicor Fabry on this car from us.
With peace, we are waiting for a European dualway in Switzerland and Korea.
That's what we're gonna have to do for the next year.
Can you mark something now?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsian Rallye looked at the world's mastership, you got your maximum in the series.
Doesn't it hurt you to try a dark trace again?
It's not crazy.
Oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not allowed your doctor to make a confirmation of the work of incapacity, which serves as a evidence for the organization that you cannot carry out health care.
Moreover, you didn't tell the employee right now.
Even so, although the day will be evaluated as allowed, the agreement was only walking in the mouth.
Although the labour law does not impose the obligation to make a written confirmation of the agreement of the employee with the black allowed, this procedure has been certified in practice.
It will only come to the oral agreement, you do not have any confirmation.
In the case of your case, a data-consent with black allowed, as may be considered as a non-contracted absence, thus to the immediate distortion of the work at § 53 of the Work Law.
In the case of a court-contract, the employee is so missing evidence.
Work and relationship with you, but not canceled by § 53, you have only the days listed in the computing sheet as an unexpected abstention.
The unconceived absence in the calculation sheet does not have the same effects as § 53 (e.g. the incapacity of collecting material security in unemployment), however, it is difficult to search for new jobs.
We recommend you again to visit your doctor and let you writely confirm that it has occurred in the course of your unable work (it is not the case of "uncopy", it is only the doctor's document).
When searching for a new job, you can submit and explain the document.
In the practice, it is not appropriate to underscore as to the exhibition of a written medical confirmation on the work of incapacity, the quick notice of the employer or the request of a written consent with a fresh allowance.
You're getting out of such a case of complication.
Tony Stewart's accident when returning to trace
The return to the trail ended for Tony Stewart only a half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway tours.
Stewart's subsequent thrown into the round after his right front pneumatics in 172th round, and the cart for it ended.
Stewart brought a devastated car to the garage, he didn't get up to the reporters and left.
Chief of his team Chad Johnston said that the car team 14 is disappointed, but he will now focus on the train in Richmond, Virginia, which will be the next weekend.
"I would like, and they had better performance and better conclusion," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope that we'll get more there.
Stewart went into the breakfast on Sunday evening travel with Kyle Busch, which requested the right side of his car.
"We've put on a good order in today's bathroom," Johnston added, "It just didn't come out."
Shortly after the second holiday, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed and ready to go.
After his car dropped and killed another driver at the bathroom in New York, Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup.
He decided to return this weekend, and he needed to win either a travel in Atlantic or a next travel in Richmond to get a place in the table.
He returned to carrying back during the investigation of the tragedy, in which Kevin Ward J. died 20-year-old, who chose Stewart during the trip to the road.
The authorities said that investigation of the cause of accident would take at least two weeks.
It hasn't been determined if Stewart would be in charge of such an accusation.
Three-fold champion expected a warm encouragement before the train.
Stewart started at 12 place, at the beginning of the bathroom, he worked at 10 and then even at 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122th car, Busch's car number.
18 got out of control, went out of the second truck and arrived to Stewart, which both of the vehicles sent to the shopping.
Stewart continued, but he got 21 places.

We all released it every day, which practically appeared the second fisherman around the chat.
Then we hit Savo there.
Incredible puzzle!
Our source in the magazine explained enough beautiful vacuum water.
And it wasn't any one who was professionally done, but the grandfather put it out with his own help.
A long time ago.
She was just on three shoes, and she was totally awesome, as the end of everything on the chat, but as I'm saying.
The water was great.
Until the airport.
When we started with the water, of course we washed water.
When she was there a few months, she deserved it.
But then we seemed that the water wasn't worn.
We've been attacked if something didn't fall there.
In the place where it passed, it was possible at a bit of laughing, the table couldn't be stuck there, so the opening was comfortable with the tissue of the tissue.
Our inspection confirmed that the cylinder moved.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we lighted it up to the bottom.
So we released her and cleaned it again.
Of course, we have improved the improvised tissue around the corner.
We've noticed strange things in the store.
On the ground, a nice packaging with a white cotton was lying.
So at least it looked.
And on the cup else.
Now it looked like a mouse.
At the street, in the places where the floor is, the herd's finding, were the rest of the fish!
And he's hard to go!
Our magazine is also fair.
Someone would say the grandfather was soon to bury the chat.
And it wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just a thrown sand, only a rock is broken.
It's giving the ship primarily there.
And the car.
And a bed on the beach.
The gate with the wide seas was mostly opened when someone walked there in one shot.
There are a few already mentioned grounds.
Without a network, so the birds run running there, and the birds put their neck on their trames.
The mouse is unfortunate to mention.
Grandpa wanted it to fly, and that's it again.
He's not even helping the air now.
The whole store was crazy.
So we cleaned the whole department.
Especially the fish on the trame was survival!
We also threw things around: ladies, heraclite table, and so.
Our chat remotely welcomed the surrounding desinfektion odder.
We're thinking about who could get the bad rest there?
The nearest cat lives two miles from here in the village.
It'd be hard to get to us.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who's not all right.
If he didn't shoot the Frank's crazy down there?
There's practical every year, stupid ideas, that's him.
We decided to watch the store and the pool and regularly control.
After a few days, everything was okay.
We started using the water again, but only on myths and feeds before the tests are ready, but it was good.
Getting water from the forest student is nothing I want to do.
Once we heard the horrible shock of our pheny.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw her in the grass near verandy with a strong black dream.
The row shot over her and kidnapped her like a crazy.
Mom was surprising her because she thought Reza had won a relief dream from the whistle.
At once, however, the dragon fell partly into the club, and partly moved.
The balcony has been cut off.
Reza got histerical relief.
We're running down.
The rubber, long over a meter and heavy as a bullet, wanted to swallow a huge cup and Reza's defense in it.
It wasn't worried if she wanted to save the cup or if she wanted to feed it alone, but it was inappropriate.
When the consumer saw the past in the form of our whole family, she probably told us that we would feed it when we were so hungry, and she was nicely moved into the store.
We've been flying after her.
It's like a black shot for the pool.
Only that way, we've mentioned another bullet package on her tables.
According to the wheat, it's like a fish.
She wasn't there!
Our new security around the shoes was a little shider.
And that's what we've locked over the day.
That it would...
We went out and we all got to one floor.
We didn't wait.
It's been crazy for the cotton.
First, a floor head with yellow months on the neck appeared.
Then the whole pack was thrown into the coat.
She went down around her shot and started getting inside.
The employee was borrowed, buyed a notebooks company and sold them
The hot employee purchased a computer company and then sold them.
He got money to lose before the police was arrested.
During a short time, the man purchased in 12 cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"Notebooks after receiving, he brought them to Olomouce, where he sold them on bases," said the Supreme Commissioner of the Shumper Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive of undergrounds was the employees to leave and to win money.
"When he listened, he claimed that he used money to pay credits," Brückner said.
Police also discovered that the underwater was a patological player who was repeatedly treated in psychiatries.
The money could also be finished in excellent devices or in video-lottery terminals.
"The fact is that we haven't found any money," said Commissioner.
The underwater, who has been punished once for stealing, is now threatening to stay in service within one year to five years.
Policies have not yet done whether the penalty would also be threatened to the basebooks who bought and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they have collected completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the baser owners has been accused yet.
Come on, a bit more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We's Prague.
The computers have prepared a few changes for us this year.
The biggest was a change in the road that led the goal to the ship, rather than leading back to the Yellow Lights.
I was happy to carry with the rest of the team, but I got him to live so little on the other hand.
The whole team and I decided personally to heal our readers at the station where we were together and broke videos.
To reach the perfectness of my view on the other side, I accepted the role of the personal leader.
Along with Catago's friend, we were closely organized to the end of the 60 to 70 minutes.
We welcomed friends who went around us to the sector for more running.
There was no longer too much time.
A couple of springs on dilution, enable sport tests, calculation and start!
Instead of starting the jaso, the jasso's crying followed the cupitation to the start of the line.
After five minutes, we're getting to the door, we're going to switch up, and we're breaking up the temper at ten hours.
We broke with the yellow hair of runners, who like Cata'a run their first train.
Even so, everyone looks fresh, slowly sunrising on the cloud adds a view of the high garden almost to the springing of the wind.
It looks like the whole Prague runs here.
On the coasts between the High Garden and the National Division, traditionally, it begins to show who has power.
Easy cup on the Palack site makes many runners relax or go to a walk.
Soon before I passed to Divadelna, I see the police carrying, and immediately after him the Victory of Pavlitus flys with an incredible temper to the goal.
I'm listening to a wonderful fucking breath of the final runners.
I'm moved to the border of the treat, I'm encouraged him, he wants to weep with me, but soon before he's getting my feet down and our hands get too swift.
Itself the Divadel Street gives chances for a short rest and breathing.
There's a need for us to have places in which my views will breathe.
The surrounding in Manes' pool shows the Prague in the entire beautiful west sun.
I don't breathe and my feet take me almost alone.
It's a time of truth for the first farmer.
On the road, Cata's screaming on the road and leading to the floor.
I see if she doesn't help, and I'm going to run a series of words encourageing her to have no time to think of pain.
It's rising up and continued in the street of Kozi, it's one of the most useful places of trate, in this stage of trains, although there's no such naval, but it's needed to follow the surroundings.
I don't know yet that the most useful place is to get his real importance in the post.
At the Vasque Laptop, frenetics encourage us to be tourists and friends of the rest of running.
I'm trying to get along with everyone who offers a hand, and I advise it to Kata, because ten tissues with a fan is like a half of the energy tissues.
It works, we're looking again, and if we've fallen quite clearly, it's now starting a running driving.
We have tens of runners, when I have someone especially stuck, I'm trying to encourage him to say, "Come, you'll be able!"
No one's going to overcome us, we'll see.
While we were running for a hour and a quarter, we add, there's nothing to wait.
Three miles to the goal will be pained, but it's needed to be right.
The sun has fallen slowly and the end of the symbolic day slowly ends the train.
The final walk to the pool, the round, and just the equation to the goal.
The time we're running, I'm confused where this girl's taking it?
"Come on, let's go under 13 hours, let's go!" I'm calling.
We're trying, we're printing, and it's the goal.
13 hours and six seconds.
Well, what's going to be done.
The trainer set the limit for twenty hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
That's a great outset.
I'm helping her to get a battle where she's relaxing for a while.
It's on her to see exciting, but also happiness from a good conduct.
After a minute, I'll take her out of the target space.
Euphoria doesn't think about pressure in front of the shoes.
Here's seeing that Kozi's street wasn't the most useful place.
This is here for the purpose of the floor, which is under the stress of ten thousand runners to be stuck.
If anyone doesn't have davy, it's not a place for.
And I'm going to think if the beautiful views and the spectacles in the past years were more interesting for what's going on in the goal.
From my own experience, I know that it's no fun.
It adds ten thousands of people, the rich delivery programme and the closing of the whole Centre of Prague for all transport, is a great challenge.
The annual road change showed to the runers a lot of interesting places, which also brought a few realities of inappropriate surprises.
The electoral atmosphere in the Yellow Lasses has been transferred between running and in the same bathroom.
Organizators around the trace and the accidental shoes graduated it at each meter of trace.
Unfortunately, during the city running the historical center, it must be counted with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the mass travel in the place that is on the one hands of the walls and the other river, I don't think it's the best solution.
I'll say that the bathroom ended with the goal, I'll appreciate it as very done.
For the purpose, I was a little worried about the health of those involved, but, finally, everything was well done.
Write us to the debate if you liked the road and what you say to the goal.
The prison overseers in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of employees in the field of service throughout Bulgaria have become a global protestant meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the main city of Sofia.
On the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their request to rebuild workshops that have recently changed.
In the list of requests to be negotiated with the Interim Minister for Justice by Christo Ivanove, there are even higher payments.
The supervisors of the month protested against the new work at the time and requested to return to 20-hour changes.
Although the Committees of Years Overseers and Representatives of the Ministry of Justice had met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State ́dio (BNR) was informed.
"The Contracts are still running," said the BNR leader of the Rozen Zhelyazkov Years Service.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Agency of Workers to the Ministry of the Internal Ministry are also attached to the protests of employees.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them
Physical habits of bestsellers are not writing, but Brian Green from the Columbia University was held to black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way to get to the hostel of problems that are faced today by a series of theoretical physics - trying to unify two greatly functioning, but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantity theory and the theory of general relativeness.
One of the reasons for success of the Elegant Universe is that in the search of a united physical theory, there is no needy story.
Physical basic problem between two key theories (for at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and so probably decided that it is worthy of translation and lakes.
Greene also advised to the complex material so fresh and that it could not be calculated how interesting it was in his book.
Furthermore, his "error" of the most important part was in the two other books: The structural of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Of course, the author would not do anything against it if his book was an older, but the fact is that, even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides everything important that the ambition-informed ambitional ambition should consider about this important part of the theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the next years there will be only something living in this area (for example because the LHC spectator will finally go to "full gas" and thus is a good moment to enter Green in the unusually opened doors of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three space dimensions, it can certainly sound of pockets, fantastics, wonderful or mysticks.
Yet, it's particular and totally acceptable.
And they understand it, we'll turn our look from the universe for a while as a whole to something more accommodated, particularly to a long and thick garden shark to be thrown.
Imagine a stometer garden shadow gets from one side of the canyon to the other and you follow from a half kilometre distance (as on the image and on the next side).
From that distance, you easily mention aside in the horizontal direction of the shadow, but if you just don't suffer by a bistro-srackness, you distinguish the shadow tissue.
In view of your great distance from the dragon, you would think that the marble that has been born on the dragon has only one dimension in which it can be passed: the left-right dimension divides the shadow.
When someone asks you where the morning was at the given time, you will only answer him with one data: the distance of the motion from the left (or the right) end of the shadow.
That's all we want to say just that from a half kilometre distance it looks like a long cow of the dragon as a single-dimensional object.
In the winter world, he's got a shadow of the darkness.
Increasingly, we look at the second dimension -- in the face of the circle of the olive serpent.
In this increased view, it is obvious that a marble in a position may be moved in two independent dimensions: in a well known left-right dimension after the length of the dragon, but also in a "dimension in/contrast to the movement of the hour hands", so around the circle of the dragon.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of the small m'ench, you have to specify two numbers: how far it is from the end of the dragon and where it is on the circle of the olive serpent.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the shadow is double-dimensional (a.k. experts will notice that this colline is clearly focused on the infection theory of the strun.
The non-usual aspects are discussed in paragraph 12 and 13.
The surface of the shadow is double-dimensional: one long-depth dimension is displayed directly by a pipe, the size in the direction of the circuit, marked by a circle-pipe, is short and swimming.
However, between these two dimensions is a division.
The size of the shadow is long and easily visible.
The size of the olive surroundings of the dragon is short, "swift" and worse known.
And they realized the existence of the circle dimension, we had to examine the drama with a very better solution.
This example illustrates the significant property of space dimensions.
That they're dividing into two groups.
They may be big, spread, and therefore directly clear, or small, swine, and much worse observeable.
Of course, in this case, we have not just crossed, and we have discovered the "swined" size of the olive bullet.
You've got enough to take help for a remote view.
But if the dragon was tired - like hair or capillar -, the swimming size was only discovered with a great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent his article to Einstein, in which he broke with a terrible idea that the space geometry of the universe could have more than three of us all known dimensions.
His radical statement Kaluza refused by providing the additional dimension of an elegant and convinced mechanism in which Einstein’s general relativeness and the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell can be vested into the only united concept structures.
The question is immediately questioned how this Kaluz's spectrum is going on with the evidence that we see just three dimensions of the space.
The answer that Kaluza silently assumed between the rows and that he expressed and expressed the Swedish math’s Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls with the claim that the space geometry of our universe can have both large and swine dimensions.
This means that as the size in the direction of the dragon length, our universe has a large, light and easily visible three dimensions, which we realize each moment.
But the analogy with the circle area of the garden shadow can have the universe and additional dimensions, firmly cut into the space so unclean that they have remained in front of our most perfect experimental machines.
And they obtained a clearer idea of the basic of Kaluz's watchful nava, let's stay at the shadow.
Imagine that we draw a black color with a relatively thick series of circles.
The distances still look like the shadow like a tiny single-dimensional line.
With a remote view now, thanks to the drawing, we'll reveal the swine size still, and we'll see the same motive of image 2.
Clearly, we see that the surface of the dragon is double-dimensional, with one size large and even unlimited and with the other short and circle.
Caluza and Klein arrived with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but other than one small circle dimension has three large space dimensions, so the four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
And their imagination has helped a little, let's see the illustrations of the 3r; it shows two large sizes and one small size of the circle.
On the image, we increase the view of the space geometry as we increased the surface of the shadow.
Each following level represents a huge increase in the range geometry from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of zooming), if they are swimming into enough small space; so we explain that we have not yet observed them.
The fourth network represents the currently known "ground" size, while the circle is a new, small and swimming size.
Just as the coppers are cut in the bullet, and these circles exist in every place of cycle dimensions -- we have only decorated them in the square network because of the view.
The background of image 4 represents a runningly known space structure - a usual world around us - in running measurements such as the meters, represented by the side of the small square in the quarter network.
On every next image, we focus on a small image of the pre-view; we increase it to become visible.
In the beginning, nothing is special, as we see at some of the first levels of zooming.
However, when we follow our way after the microscopic properties of the space, at the fourth level of zooming in image 3 - we look at the sudden new, in the face of the circle with a sweet size, similar to the cups in the thickness of the copper.
Caluza and Klein arrived with the idea that the additional circle dimension exists everywhere in the direction of large dimensions similar to the dragon circle circle at each point of its length.
In the interest of the view, we have limited the circle dimension only in some, regularly distributed points.
Image 4 of Kaluzo and Klein's representation of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
Similarity with smoke is evident, perhaps we mention important differences.
First, the universe has three large, remotely distracting space dimensions (of which we have only drawn two), where the dragon has a large size only one.
More important is that we are now talking about the space geometry of the universe alone, not just about the inside of the universe, perhaps our shadow.
The basic idea is the same.
The additional circle is extremely miniature dimension, spread it - as the circle of the dragon - much more difficult than observed apparent, big and extensive dimensions.
If the additional size is sufficiently small, it will be discovered in the ability and over the power of our most modern tools for zooming.
The most important, however, is that the additional dimension is not only a wide range within the running dimensions, as the double-dimensional illustration mistakes.
The curve dimension is a new dimension that exists in each point of three running distances.
This is the dimension of three remaining dimensions independently as are the sizes of the shore-downs, the left-right and the front-to-the-side independent (and round) each other.
A little bit can be moved in all the four dimensions and to determine its position, four data needed, except three clothed positions still in the circle dimension; if we also count the time, then five, in each case more than one of them were normally expected.
Did you look like it?

The price for the e-book is 149, Cz.
To our surprise, then, we find that if we are only three dimensions of the space, Kaluzov and Klein's views show that there are no additional sweet dimensions, if they are sufficiently small.
The universe can have more dimensions in a calm way than we can see them with only eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can expand the structure of a large billion billion meters.
The smaller sweet size we can only observe.
In 1926, the little p ́s idea of Kaluz's was combined with some thoughts from the birth of the quantity mechanics.
His calculations indicated that additional circle dimensions could have an approximately one of Planck's length, so the size far away from the skills of today’s devices.
Since that time, physics will call the possibility of additional small space dimensions of Kaluss-Klein theory.
Hoz Homola advises how to practice on electric cytarr: 5
The whole "double" foundation consists in a 12-tax harmonical form that you can liberally repeat.
Whoever hits music theory, finds her principle detailedly explained here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By building a lottery and a lottery, whose facebook profile can be followed here, they live as a graphic from maturity twenty years ago.
It's a kytarist of the hall Wohning, which, despite all, doesn't be able to leave.
Kytaristou is after his father, like Brother Mateus, leader of Wohnnets.
With training, press on one stream.
"Rythmical model is only for you, you can find anything, then it's enough to apply it to the harmonical model of twelve," Honza advises.
If you add another stream, you can change the figure again.
It's enough to listen to and follow Honza, which is done with the twelve harmonisation of two streams to think and how nicely it starts to sound.
If you pick up the third stream, you can coke with Melodia with a melody.
When you finally add the fourth, watch on the change of shipment, Honza warns in the video.
Next, Honza will come back to the pentatonic and you'll try to give her a dockmade just with a twelve.
So exercise her honestly.
As best, you read it in a conversation with Jane Homolo at the first lesson of his school game on the electric cytar here.
Other without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, recognizes the Garden.
We're taking a point and we're too busy.
For half time we had more chances, the second household," said the attacker that this time scratched from the pig.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but you just got her a bitter sand?
Something especially I didn't leave it, even though on the second side, where the householders are, it would probably be worse.
You've got a penalty after half-day, but you've also got from the penalty after four minutes.
What happened?
We slept in the beginning, we were a past, we got out of that corner and then a penalty after it.
After her you got up and first half time you were the best team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the stop?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we've been playing after incased . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the cabin we said we wanted to keep the game time after it, but we couldn't.
To say the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is also likely that households have said something about stoping their games, and they haven't had too much pleasure with her.
You've been first at the square, while you've not been at home yet.
Why's that a division like that?
I wouldn't say that it's such a depth, it's more important to us how we're going to do that.
We started well in Brna, but then it was bad from us, Plz, that's a different category.
Four stories you were waiting for, didn't you afraid that after the past hit, it could be similar?
It may not be, but we are understanding that from the past, we don't have to listen to the speech of waiting for the past.
Now we've added more, but there's still only three in six ships, which's not yet to a great celebration.
Iceland - the lava is running from kilometers of the remote cycle.
The league flying to the surface of Holuhraun near Vatnayekull’s neighborhood, covers the underground tunnel from kilometers of the remote corner.
It is located under the ledge, as well as the part of the modified underground law tunnel.
This is now the most worrying thing...
The situation remains unchanged.
From yesterday (31.8.
2014) it continues to fly from the pool of approximately the same quantity of lava.
However, its quantity is lower than 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
In contrast to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x.
However, the scientists do both that the law tunnel could be opened in places where it is under ice.
It would also happen, in addition to the similar intensity that the current eruption leads, that would mean a huge floor, as in the River Jökulsá na Fjöllum, so on the other rivers.
In the surrounding area, it is to feel a strong surface, from the market, the clouds of couples and gases.
It is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism movement, as was in the case of eruption in Fimmwardhals in 2010.
This is much more and there is also much more gases," says vulcanolog Armann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has been significantly improved since yesterday, and in early hours, it has been incredibly unbelievable.
The feet after the sand storms were shaking rain.
Scientists can continue their job.
For aeroplane operation, the orea (thirdst highest) shall be applied for the bardenswing and yellow (third) for Askju.
Heaven over Cheb belonged to a courageous Lady Peggy.
She went through the wheels
A flying day in Chebu.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine, Peggy Walentin's acrobat was presented, who went out of the cockpit to the road on the top wheel and also between the wings.
It's only rejected for the power of the swallows.
The aircraft day in Chebu has been held once in the year and has been able to prepare a number of interesting aircraft shops again.
The Prime Minister at the oldest Czech Airport was not only "boots after wings" in the delivery of the German acrobat Peggy Walentins, but also the legendary traveler P-51 D Mustang or aeroplane Beechcraft 18.
The guy took attention to himself with his severe shield.
Acrobate called Wingwalking has p' in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots were so trying to make.
But because of a large number of death attacks, it was prohibited.
But today, he's going back to the plane of flying days.
Peggy goes out of the cockpit to the top wheel.
There's different trains.
At the end of the exhibition, it moves into the space between the flight wings where its show continues," described the Many Matejeck from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the planning day organizer.
The pilot of Boeing Stearman 75 is her wife Friedrich.
If Peggy's exhibition was the main cup of the program, then the next representation of Mustang's traveller was a story of the coat.
The Legendary Traveler was approved with the Grippes of the Armies of the Czech Republic in the coast (that is called numbers).
The flight fans in Czech could first see.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavski, then, introduced a breath of an acrobacia with an airport from 1945.
He's been done for war, but he's probably never participated.
He was included in military reservations.
Since 1963, he acted in civil sfera.
It's like a travel airport.
Today, he has his householding hangar at the airport in Mnich Hradišti.
On the same place, there is another cheb aircraft perl, a double-motor Beechcraft C45H Expert.
The airport wasn't a powerful machine to watch.
He's a thrown cycle stretched away.
He also obtained the Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French airport.
The small transport aircraft surprised the rejected Turbolet and from the German Hof brought part of the German delegation on the airport day.
German neighbors in Chebu were transferred with reconstructed aircrafts Like 18T or a three-party forming of Bücker Jungmann doubles.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return before the camera!
The parental concerns changed Lucie Borhy at least for this evening for the work.
Stress or nervousness - a blonde moderator doesn't apparently know anything.
Modernizing television reports is a good way, as if she did not stop with him for two months!
It's just two weeks when the blonds ended six weeks, where women lived after birth the biggest stress.
However, Lucie still shows regularly in the main reporting session TV Nova.
The regular return is waiting for it according to the information Blesk.cz for a month.
It's just her daughter Linda's now more than television shoes.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen, and it was a trap to black.
Exhibitions for a year in Prague?
Hala would sell, plan the Yagr divorce.
It would be awesome if something like that had been done during the mistery of the world.
But it depends on how the union will be established," he said in Jihlava after exhibition with the name Golden Return, in which the glorious Nagan team was gathered again.
And players who shared in the golden hattrick.
Players would like to, right?
Sure.
It would soon be good to make a divorce with a golden generation during mystery.
I think they're going to find one two days during the tour, when it's full free and where it'd be possible to mix such a fluid.
We'll say that to Gumo (Jirim Šleigrovi) or Bedjai Šcherban (subsistent of the Yulovian ship), who would take care of it...
Aréna would be sold.
But what if you play with New Jersey play-off?
So when I'm coming so...
You don't want to play in a representation.
Or the Julava meeting changed your decision?
Recreation and exhibition are two different things and in representation are determining performances.
One thing is that people would see me there, but the executions are determining, especially for the world's mystery.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has never changed.
How did you actually use this nagan search?
It's just that the player's meet was great.
The man lived his stories and lived a lot of funny.
It was a great effect not only for fans, but also for our hokehists.
Of course, the most important was Ivan Hlink's honour.
And it's good to put the story of our hokey and that one generation is going out that's actually worth it.
Slavimir Lener, Vladimir Rhánička and Peter Czechmanek on the shooter.
You're going to get your first representative storage on yourself?
It doesn't care about such things.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: I, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, were in one three places.
For all this was the first start of representation.
Well, that they were dominated in such a way, so it can't be said.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hashek was captured for a long time.
What did you say about his accomplishment?
I'm never surprised by Hashan on ice.
I wanted to return to him with that critical, but I can't (Hashek criticized Yagra for d’you, why he decided to finish in the representation).He simply asked finely.
He's even a big deal.
At the same time, he was driving with me once in the night, and he was there.
And now he's catched.
First of all the United States and then the Netherlands, the Balists start .
To the NH Hotel, the Middle Wednesday afternoon, there were prominent guests.
People were able to deal with Petra Czech from Chelsea, a representative trainer of Paul Vrbu...
And here, the piece in the black kitchen, that's Tomás Rosski!
Arsenala and the representative of the officer reached a meeting about half the twelveth among the last.
We're waiting for a beautiful fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be pleased?" said when the reporter was already presented in a representative competition.
Czech representation programme
Monday, 1 September: start of the meeting, first train
Tuesday 2 September: Trainink opened for fans (18:30, Year) Autogramia (20:00)
Wednesday 3, September - USA (20:15, Year)
Tuesday 9 September - Netherlands (20:45, Year) end of the meeting
Russian and gentlemen can support the fans before the centership against the United States (20:15).
The retreat for them also opened the morning train that starts at the Years at 18:30.
And after him he will follow the autograms that Russian or Czech miss.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be more calm.
What praises the trainer Vrba, who just moved to a number of social action on the jail.
Finally, we're going to do what we want to do.
Now we'll focus on the Netherlands.
It's a benefit when you've got players in the town eight days.
We will have time to practice things that haven't been so long," he praised the Vrba, which officially leads the national team from January.
The Czech Baltic Representation will take a museum image when entering the new ≥ cycle.
Repreaction has three bags behind it, all ready.
With Norway and Finland, she repaired 2:2 and with Croatia spent 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's right now.
In the context of the Netherlands, it is also a depreciation of the procedure for Europe's skills in 2016.
Czech mastership would, of course, help if the General against the United States.
It was a half hour, and they met.
Now there are important outcomes.
We have to think about it, and they were successful," he agreed.
The only player of a 30-year-old nomination with health problems is David Lafat's attacker.
He's suffering from the temperature.
If he would not be able to cure the center of the United States, the trainer Vrba would call another attacker.
Genetic infections are often bad
A woman in British describes how she thought she would die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being agitated with another illness, Karin Rodgers had a growth in thinking that she remained just a few years of life.
It was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of heritage disorders that harm nerves outside the brain and patrol.
The charitable CMT UK organization noted that bad diagnosis is a running problem among people with CMT, because only a little bit of disease is known.
It is as if CMT suffers about 23,000 people in the United Kingdom, which can be shown symptoms in the engine, such as weakness, insufficient behaviour, and wrapped fingers on the feet.
In those affected, it may also result in insight or pain, this condition is untreated and progressive, which means that symptoms are worse during the time process.
When Rodgers was the thirteen, she thought she suffered Freedreich's attaxis (FA) - illness that had a very bad predict.
She believed that before she celebrated the eighteenth birthday, she would be thrown on the road chair, and she was dead before she was thirty.
“ As a child, I thought I could not do the same things as the end, ” says the mother of two children now 51.
I fell down every day, and everything left me longer.
I couldn't drive with the rest of the kids on the cottons or on the scateboard, and I was shocked at school because of how I was walking and running."
When Rodgers was the 13th and was after several operations that had to release her Achil's chairs and just the loop, she used her doctor to go out of the room and looked at her documentation where she learned she had suffered FA.
"I felt proud because I followed, and so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked for information about the disease in the book and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When they answered me, I was in a shock, I was totally paniced.
I thought that before I have ten, I'll end the car, and before I have fifty, I'll be dead, and I'll lose all my skills gradually.
I was completely alone for it and I planned my funeral."
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to behave wasn't worse as much as she assumed and asked her chirurg.
He just stood up, covered her and said: “Look, I don’t think you have a sickness here, otherwise you would have been on the car.
I think it'll be a lot less dangerous."
After a number of genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained what CMT is, I thought I was a happy child," she said.
The charitable CMT UK organization started a month of CMT information to warn this disease.
Undertakers in Washington: with the economy's turnover, taking taxes
The growth economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And the higher taxes too.
According to the new investigation that was published last week, the state and local fires in the country with the healing of the economic health last year grew quietly, and the companies in Washington were not exceptional.
Undertakers in Maryland and Virginia for the financial year 2013 took 27.6 billion dollars to State and local stocks, which is more than $26.6 billion than $26.6 billion.
Tax charges - State and local - were 4,3 per cent for $671 billion in comparison to $3.9 per cent last year and was the third growth year after 2009 and 2010 when tax decreased.
According to the study conducted by the professional company Ernst & Young and the political group of Center on State Taxation, the State tax increased by 4.3% than local drives by 3.9%.
More than the half of the tax income of the circuit, 56 %, is from the animal tax, and 36 % of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows the relatively smallest tax income from the business.
The investigators claim that the share of tax income growth results from increased value of the insolvency of enterprises, which increased by 3.7 % by the inability of this year after three years following its past year with the growth of -1 %.
Although the most profits come from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems to be the same in Washington.
Communities in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini last year paid over 10 billion dollars on State and local taxes of immobility, which represents an annual growth of 4,2 %, compared to 9,6 billion in 2012.
However, the evident increase in the value of invalidity does not reduce the state and local tax revenue in Maryland where the tax of insolvency represents the non-complete five of the company's statements.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., it represents a tax of immobility in the meaning of half state and local opinion.
“In Maryland, a lot of fire-incapacity, especially the basis for taxes in the area of D.C., government or non-educative organisations which are not paying taxes” explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to pay much more income tax, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
Recent increase in tax income from undertaking cannot only be assigned to the healthy market with insolvency.
According to data, income from undertakings also appear to be increased.
The companies in this region published a tax from the revenue of commercial companies of $2,3 billion, which increased from $2,1 billion from 2012.
Maryland has chosen one billion dollars in the region on the income of business companies.
Although they are taken into the same direction, the local tax charge of businessmen does not grow in these three places equally.
The growth measure in D.C. was at the total average level of 4,3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia, a medium increase was to 4.1 %.
Virginia has the lowest estimation of the income of the business companies, 6 % from all three circuits (of which all have the same opinion).
The measure of trade companies in Maryland is 8.25 % while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975 %.
Similar studies conducted by the American trade room this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local opinions and totally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study was unexpected.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
The North Carolina recently signed the law that reduces trade tax from 6,9 % to 6 %, equal to Virginia, and the following year the tax is decreased to 5 %.
In the next year, the income goals will continue to be fulfilled, and the income measure may be reduced to 3 % in 2017 by the law laid down by the income.
According to recent studies with small businesses in Washington, it makes it better, so it pays higher state and local taxes.
The tax of livelihood by small enterprises as a tax of personal revenue - the structure of compensation for increased prices by the increase in prices, which is organized by fire - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, increased by 20 % in $2,4 billion last year, much more than other taxes.
The investigators claim that the trend and national increase in animal tax will probably continue next year, the total tax income from the sales for State and local governments will be increased to 6,2 % in comparison with the same period in the first three fourth year 2014.
However, Washington can stop the finals because the reduction of state expenditure is to choose its tax on the labour market.
What prevented you: the leader of Europe will be Tusk, Putin Novoruski and Lafat's necks
Is there a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for the negotiation of Novorusca

In addition, according to the lawmaker, it is to know the manuscript.
Incomplete promises.
Options are closed and the sides are offered again and impossible
The end of the homeless in the streets, parking for every family and a lawn over Prague.
It is repeated before every choice: the parties promise it impossible.
Now also, with nearly communal elections, politics are prejudiced to who is more interested in the electors.
Server Lidovky.cz has chosen incomplete promises from present and past.
70 years ago, the Czech Slovenians were released in Dunkerque.
Initial deterioration
It was on 30 August 1944 when the Czech Republic of Czech Republic moved to France.
Her commander Alois Liška was systematicly asked for completion of technical equipment and sending to front.
The British Party finally called up, and this earthly unit was organized as one of its forces in the covering of the Dunkerque town, which remained in the power of German armies.

How to survive the return from the allowed?
Don't hurry anywhere and get your sleep
The last days are empty before us.
Resurrection after returning from the sun beach or chalupe to the running work may be for a lot of wheels.
He can even make her depression.
Fortunately, there are certified types of ways to equilibrate changes: not to accelerate and make a quality sleep.
Family Joan Rivers: "We keep our fingers"
Joan Rivers has been inconscient three days since they brought her to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter today said that it wasn't working on that a 18-year-old comic is going to be healed.
"Thank you for your salutes and support," Melissa Rivers said in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a telephone to a saved service, as she suggested, to a heart arrest at the Yorkwill endoscopy in Upper East Side, as she indicated.
The doctors will maintain it in respect of the effect of sedative and severe supervision until they make sure that it remains “severe”.
The reactions did not allow to wait and it was mostly uncomfortable on the Internet from personality such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is crossed titles
That media cross the reality with their titles, there is no news.
I know that the titles "sells" newspapers, but, despite all, I know that many of them are called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's the fact that's suffering me very much last time, it's more exciting than the word of noise.
This is, in particular, the articles on the conflict of Israel and Hamas in Gaza's paper.
All running are the titles "Israel attacked Gaza".
Once in the text, you read that the Israelian "attake" was a reaction to the exhausted rackets from Gazy's song, which is often announced at the time of the announced advance.
Then it will be the title "The two sides have breathed."
Does the newspapers realize that this process is directly involved in antisemit positions that grow throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Not even sixty years since the end of World War II.
Now people who survived Shaw are alive.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where he gave the password "Jewish svin" and similar confidence, I was arrested.
That's what the world wants to finish what didn't happen to Hitler?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews they were appointed to eliminate Slovenia?
Ladies and gentlemen, please take a little more care of your job.
You are often marked as "the watching dogs of democracy".
So take her.
As long as he's here.
And also deal with the right of the only democracy state's right on the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like to keep our government, if some of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation was devastating and the Czech Republic waste from the map of the world?
Maybe you should also know another fact.
In the country of Israel, 20% of the Arabs with Israel's citizens lived in the country.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don't go between "their" or Gaza, they'll answer you why they would do it?
In Israel, I have a job, social security, and a spy health care (I just saw in my own eyes, in the Holy Private Hospital Hadass, financed by sponsoral gifts of Jews throughout the world, running and the Arabs, and there are understandingly treated).
Hamas will also attack his Arab brothers with his shots.
The only real help of Gaza, and also this insult, is to save Hamas and weapon him.
Not to condemn Israel, but to be in the titles.
Inform about the practices of Hamas, about his misuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas has the goal of delivering the state of Israel, for any price.
And for the price of the death of innocent Arab children.
Notify that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Notify that in nine years of self-sufficiency in Gaza this could have been exciting thanks to humanitarian assistance throughout the world.
Even from Israel, which adds water and electricity for which Gaza managers do not pay, and even discourage that they are sometimes interrupted.
If Hamas hadn't invested money in the building of underground tunnels so that self - killed attackers in Israel's territory, but perhaps in the building of houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon buys for $1,04 billion Twi
AMAZON just confirmed the statement Information from Monday: Internet little trader - video manufacturer and hundreds of other things - buying for $1.04 billion (970 million US dollars) video streaming service Twi.
The announcement caused surprise because no one would expect you to buy someone, but because it was expected to be YouTube buyer.
Three months ago the sale of Twitche Googlu seemed to be a billion safe, and this connection looked natural.
Twi, which founded Justin.tv three years ago, had been enabled to become a generally used video streaming service - a living version of YouTube.
Instead, it became a platform for players who sent online transfers from her - words Business Insider “YouTube for Live Transfer Games”.
Interface Twitche.
On YouTube are already ≥arrival videos "Let's play", a type where wise people ( Most elderly) give Mystery Science Theater processing games.
It is that YouTube at the Description ofTwitche comes to a lot, so the reports that YouTube buys Twi, no one's overwhelmed, was a student example of how the entertainment will pay my competition.
It is mystery why the YouTube agreement did not come out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as the Amazon.
Everything we are currently available is the CEO Twitche Emmeta Sheara: "We have chosen Amazon because it is not in our company, he has the same values and time of vision and wants to help us fulfil it more."
Another mystery is - honestly - an incredible success of Twitche.
For snows like me, who claim that sport is better doing than following, it is hard to understand what is so eyeful on games instead of playing only to observe.
One thing is to look at three friends through the arms, playing Resident Evil, and the other thing is to observe someone stranger, how he gets twenty sticks in the head in the Call of Duty.
All the games you could just look at.
Another problem is that with today's, most of the hares are from the perspective players, so looking at their record, without controling the perspective yourself, it's a good recept how to arrange the possibility.
I admit that games type speed run in which Roger Bannisters our electronic time will end the game at record time is fun.
But someone is not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitchi probably is very interesting.
But what about the skeptic like me?
Twi has 55 million visits monthly and is fourth on the top of the Internet operation.
How exactly will Amazon use that?
It's hard to imagine that Twi's mixed into Amazon Instant Video as elegant as if it could be able to join YouTube.
But Twi has something she wants to draw every company: the hordes of young men who inserents want.
As the director Twitche Shear said, Amazon and Twi "belief in the future of her" and the media don't seem to be stuck, nor as a half-smoking - whisky.
Second basic lie of creationism.
Next Czech translation of the American Atheist Vlogger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
A p-video has been added.
Another fundamental lie of creationism is the faith that holy texts were written by God and not by human authors.
When they discuss one of the many things that are in contrast with their religion, they often ask us: Who will you believe?
To God's word, or to man's word?
As if human examination was completely worthwhile in comparison with the authority that they imagine that it has their doctor.
Only when they say "man", they're talking about an accident.
And when they refer to "the word of God", they refer to myths about God written by people.
If there's a intelligent creator with an actor, then it's the one who created a physical record that discovers the evolution history, and it must be the one who invented the genetic samples that correspond to it, and it must be the one who added a number of other evidences that indicate exclusively to the evolutional conclusion in the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he tried to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of these things.
But people will lead to stories, fabulating.
And they were people who wrote all the texts that suggest that they were the word of God.
Each sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes himself as sept by people, not by gods.
People who were "inspired" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or who might have listened to the dictate of angels, but those texts were not signed to any other than only mortal men with a certain measure of imagination, nor angels, nor gods.
If there had been one god, it would be part of all gods of all religions, over-galaxic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire world.
If such size had sometimes written a book, there would be only one such book, the only font of the Holy Scriptures.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without preliminars, parallels or alternatives in any language, because the human authors would not be able to meet with such work.
And people would not have to believe them weakly because it was consistent, understood by verified and truthful evidence, and it would show deep humbleness and wisdom beyond all human limits.
It would continue to inspire every reader to a unit of common faith.
The God would not write it, they didn't expect anything less.
Only what we see in place is exactly the opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without a community, and all are continuing to spread on what more separate names, seeking contradictive truths, and in each manner, calling for divine leadership, regardless of continuing divorce and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Tora, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Coran, the Baha'u'llah Kitáb-i-Akdás, the Zarathütrov Avests, the Sikhish Adi-Granth, the Mahabarat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormonov, or the book of Urantia, are all considered "Absolute truth" and "revelled word of the only true God" and the relevant persons of each of them say that these remaining ones are on the way.
The only logical explanation is probably that they are all in a certain way.
No of the above books has any benefit.
None of them has evidence of rebellion and no one can be confirmed historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I don’t say that I proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and apologies, because they include inequalities, absurdities, and receive imaginations sometimes considered as true who have already been convinced.
So it can't be said they're evidence of God's wisdom.
Many of them are proud of deceitful beasts rather than of mutilation, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies - that everyone can also include prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
The former teologs admit that all the holy texts of any religion were written by human hands, so they are the subject of interpretation, thoughts and views of their primitive and often prejudices of political motivated authors, explaining many of the opposite and inequality in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it an opposite, but more reciprocal comments.
We need to show again that we have two different authors here whose work has been mixed during the editing review.
It is true that Genesis has more than one author and is definitely not the story of a clear witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. five of the books of Moses and Moses are not attributing authority to any of them, because he certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Professors will agree that Genesis was charged (probably by Ezra) from some of the mutually unexpected oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents have been filtered at the same time and all are assigned to human authors.
The Bible doesn’t even make it so old as she thinks.
Swimming from the Dead Sea are the oldest archeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all western monotheasticks, yet they are for many centuries younger than the roots of zoroastrian, buddhism, hinduism, helenism, drumic cultures, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
The Christianity started as a gnostic faith, followed the doctrines and episodes and their completely different views of Jesus, which finally were combined in any compromise called Orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups as luxepherians were royalized and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these adjustments is related to King Ugaritus, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers represented a primary threat to young Music religion, the authors of the New Law decided to laugh, and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord on Mount" changed to Belzebub "Lord Hope".
Thus, the Bible was intended and sublimely changed from religious and political ways.
The remaining part of what happened by the New Law was canonized in the fourth century C.E. in the series of Commission decisions on the snow in Nicaia.
The four good news were accepted and sixteen of the other were refused by a simple lifting up hands, as if such things could be accepted or refused by voting.
The way Canon was developed depending on what was read about Sundays in the early Christian centers.
What did they read on the second week after the birth of the birth of the church in Jerusalem?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they approached the same ecclesiastes.
So the nuclear canon was so developed from the front of the primary church.
So the concilie simply accepted as evangelium any relevant stories that were burning between the non-built mass at that time.
But they also received more than ten books from the Bible, even though they refer to them the books that were approved.
We will find the writings of the apostles and of the prophets among the denied items.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are only words of people and/or are not yet available?
Who was the editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved if God was the author of this adjusted mixture of stories, similitudes and psalms?
The Bible was absolutely written to people, not too light, rather than too much!
That's why it's so big part of her history and completely in a mistake that it's all about from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that the serpents and the ases could speak, believed in the injury, blood victims, ritual cups, ornated objects, fire electwars, astrology and five magic animals.
They thought that when they used a bullet that they shoot somebody with blood, it would heal it out of the lepry.
We're talking about people who thought that the Queen was a whistler and the birds are birds and whales are fish and drinks it's a whole number.
These people believed that when they showed pregnant clothes, they would be born a tenate.
How could someone who knows something about genetic?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible was written in a higher future, it would not include errors that it contains.
If she entered the pera's oversight and was intended to be a literal story, she wouldn't contain anything of what it contains.
As a moral degree, it is completely failing because, most of the Hebrew scriptures were written by unfair and bigotic wilds that overviewed or supported cruelty against animals, incest, slavery, disuse of slaves, injury of family members, infringement of children, violence against children, losses, hunger, murder, canibalism, genocide and prejudices against race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
In order to be able to deal with their misdeeds by saying that they are doing God's cause.
But the creationists still ignore this.
Some of their websites admit that if any contrast is with the Bible, it must be ignored!
Why?
Because if the creationists hadn't had their loved books, they would have no god.
There is the same in their world.
It's ironic that they reject God's "deed" as "creating creation instead of the Creator".
But they themselves consider the word of the man as the word of God and of the god of the same, and even of the fact that the return of their "holy" books is evidently to cast out God as such.
Not their version of God, but all the versions of God.
Creationists believe that if the Bible is wrong, God lies.
They cannot assume that God could exist and that the Bible could be misleading at the same time because it cannot separate the doctrine from godly devotion.
So this is a kind of idolatry where they worship the human compilation made, as if these books were a god alone, because they think they are the word of Jehovah.
Only because God never wrote or indicated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or refused to their evidence "unchanged word" any god was invented, built, purchased, interpreted, modified, and often also relatedly modified and transformed by only misleading people.

Apple iCloud seemed to have hackers, to the public, photos received to celebrate
Screenshot with Unique File Express
While anonymous on the 4chan server publishs naive and pornography photos of American celebrities, he warned the American Mashable.com server.
It is evident that it has obtained an inappropriate access to the Applu servers, where the stationers have loaded them by automatic storing images from iPhons and iPads.
Apple hasn't seen the problem yet.
The part of the celebrity rejects the photos as false, but a few of the rights of the photos has already been admitted.
It belongs to them as well as Jennifer Lawrence, known from the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games series or Mary Elizabeth Winsteadva, for example, to play in a ́tonsy paste 4.0.
The hacker's goal is to use obtained images and videos to be rejoiced.
The records have evidently shown interest in American magazines, according to reports on the 4chan server but wants hacker ra'i money from community.
According to the Next Web server, it is probably very likely to check the weakness in the security of iCloud.
On the GitHub server, two days a tool that enabled to get passwords to the hosts through brutal power, thus automatically repeating the login attempts to different passwords.
This tool worked proofly, but Apple closed the security piece after two days.
Of course, however, potential attackers had a lot of time to get access to different events before the publication of this instrument.
The iCloud users should thus change their password from preventive parts connected to Apple ID.
It is important, however, to the length of the password, not to its complexity.
Adequate length is at least 12 characters.
The outcome of photographs to be considered to be a safe use of online services.
Although fire servers such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, safe multilaterally better than computers in households or smaller companies, it is uploading sensitive photos in unsaved form of unsaved risk.
You want to store online photos or any other sensitive content, encrypt files before uploading first.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic storage of photos from the phone so that it is only on wifi and after connecting to the provider.
So you will have the opportunity to move "safe" photos at times, and you will mainly have space to delete non-numbered photos, so they will unnecessaryly collect space in the online storage.
Instruction on how to encrypt files and communications on the Internet, we offer readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of the electronic book from Michal Altair Valáska in PDF.
Fair way to protect high school scripts
Since the price for a high school script for many students is over 1,000 dollars per year, the second-year-old student came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a book payment system from colleagues of higher annuals with a proposal for nominal compensation to keep their sale from the sale.
"The book of the calculations that run 180 dollars, I got for ten and for cutting nugets at the semester," says Schroa, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would be $430, he says.
He lost 120.
According to university advice, a medium student will lose more than $1 200 per year, but students have different opportunities to control these expenditures.
The preferred choice of students remains online trades and creative solutions such as Schro ه.
At the rise, it is to pay students, which allows students to use a semestr of the book, and often with a distinctive slide before they buy it.
Neebo Inc operating more than 250 libraries in campus areas says that the payment of the book has doubled since 2011.
The research in the sector shows that approximately a quarter of books in university books was in the past yarn semester of empowered, says Vice-President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of educational texts are purchased according to the National Universal Trade Association in University Books.
Here's 101 best ways to succeed.
Online purchases
The prices of some new books may be on the Internet up to a third lower than in the university booking.
The recommended price of the nineth issue of the book “Calculus” Rona Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is at least $290, but it is possible on the Internet on Chegg.com, in a small business specialized for a school, to buy a new for $239,99.
Copy User
You don't have notices of other people or destruction and destruction, the appropriate options are useful teaching texts.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a higher annual student at Brigham Young, says he paid on Amazon.com for the useful expression “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business” 42 cents.
The new man sold for $48.
Ingrid Bracey's university teacher, leader of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, will make students check that elderly publishers are acceptable.
Sometimes there are no changes to work in the seminars.
Yes, older issues can be sold for a break of the price of the last version.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, they are a preferred alternative to buy books used to eBay Inc's Half.com.
Payment
It is also a loan for students, if you do well with them, you don't care for them to return and you don't want to have them even after the seminar ends.
You can save up to 80% of costs for a new book.
For example, a student could loan "Calculus" for about twenty dollars for the whole semester.
Please note the undertakings of the trade in which you are paying the book, which is, in particular, a position for notes, highlights or injuries and damages.
Remember: You will not return the book sometimes, the temptation may be higher than the price of the new books.
E-books
Other options are to take care of instead of the normal e-book.
Sometimes these books are basically granted in the form of the electronic licence applicable for a certain time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg is paying "Calculus" for six months for approximately 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most beneficial offers can be found by students of literary courses because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very precious.
In any case, go to business.
Joe Gault, 29, who is soon at Pepperdine Law School, recommends to conduct according to ISBN because it guarantees you buy the right book.
Before you make a book through the Internet, make sure it's a real fund, Gault advises.
He convinced that on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from the university book.
Bano, it's the wind itself.
And then they found in the pool tower of a gun from the end of the war
This pool is stuck from the church of St. Jirry.
We discovered a growth around and we started dragging a flying rent -- about a meter and a half of the bath and a snippet sheet.
When we were close to the nice day, we got on the head," Radomil Novak counted.
We dropped it out, cleaned it, and found that it was an attacking German weapons that the SS units used.
Find is evidently unusual.
According to my information, such weapons were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand," added Novak.
All wooden things have been designed in time, so it is unusable.
But her body is keeping her face.
How was it feeling in the cotton?
There is one explanation.
Perhaps people who needed to save the weapons used by the SS units were there, probably from fear that they would not be removed.
The fascists wouldn't have done it.
They dropped the weapons in the woods," they think they're finding.
The gun was the only thing that the surroundings from the Mount of the Spirit of Jessenka found in the pool.
"They could also have the hand granates, which were once around us, so we slow down the excavations, we carefully saved the wind so that there might be a disaster, but there was nothing else down there," approached Novak.
The finding will end in the repository of the museum on the lock in the nearby Sleeze Rudolties.
Ukrainian General: I haven't released the Czech prison yet
Exclude the conversation Currently.cz with the general colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the prison of Perusian separatists.
Kyiv/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they call me from Donek," maybe eight times apologized in the exclusive conversation with the currently.ch Ukrainian General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the Director of the Centre of Liberation of Warrior Princes.
General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in television debate.
When any such interruption was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they were - or should be - which Ruban advises his prosecutor at the second end of the phone.
"It's gonna be it - go there," concluded one of the black discussions with Donek and again ́s ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the stock, some of the pilots of travellers and an active anti-government protester.
Yesterday, when we had a conversation, he was in Donek.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the prison of Perusian separatists is 40 hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that at the side of Peru's separatists are fighting also the Czech.
Our controvisor considers their amount to 30.
But they may be much more.
Have you met with a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I've released the Serbs, the Dagistance, the Czech, one Swedish, the Georgian... but the Czech is not yet.
But I know to whom to turn back in Prague if they've reached your prisoner and could save him.
Ukrainian soldier occupied separatists
A.cz: What do you advise to the Czech who are added to the Perusian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers are busy?
They should understand that if the Czech fights in the Ukrainian volunteers flags and separatists are busy, it will be shot without mercy, as any other foreigner.
The separatists view these men as a pleasant soldier, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
However, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take a group of Donek separatists - and, among them, too, Czech - so they put him in a network and act with him as a military prisoner.
This guy's gonna survive soon.
The Ukrainian side also acts as a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many have you been able to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand it well, they'll change.
Some sources indicate that this has been over hundreds of men ago.
For a long time, we've stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we saved them... we didn't save them from war if they decided to continue fighting.
Salvators are in the war of doctors, chirurgs, but we're definitely not.
That's it.
And every day there's another and another.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't have to go about the exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to release prisoners and only a human request.
A.cz: It is heard that you have received great authority and confidence in the Peru separatists in a few months... as in the Ukrainian company.
How have you been able to build respect for both war party?
A hard question.
One of the experts in Kiewa gave me a "thing crazy general with the ocean woods".
It won't hurt me.
And maybe it makes the basis of our job.
As the leader of the Ukrainian spirit congregation, I have already received this authority before.
I never understand, I don't assume and keep my word.
Whatever, I do honestly, and I speak the truth.
Even when it's the Ukrainian government, or the Danish or the Luhanian very inappropriate.
Do they suffer and kill people?
So I just tell them that they're torturing and killing.
And that it's crimes.
I often risk life, even in the exchange of prisoners, and they took me... this job for me can mean the end... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many repairs and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (Large milk) ... to torture prisoners, Ukrainians and separatists are arrested at the higher hearing.
Unfortunately.
And the repairs?
You're just playing on the inside side.
I don't have any information about that the Ukrainian army also corrects the prisoners.
No signs about the Ukrainian army of something similar.
We have an idea of how many repairs, but the numbers can't be indicated, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Sign me the characters and the motives of the Perusian separatists.
There's a whistleman among them, but even the veterinarians from Afghanistan.
They are trying to identify and maybe also democracy in Donek or Luhanska - at least that they say.
They do not want to play more games with Ukrainian oligarchy.
The separatists have oligarchs full of teeth and are their imperfect opposers - to life and death.
As we're saying, they've been eating to the horse.
The same dreams and complaints of people were given in other ways and on the day.
And now I'm a little speech: Russia's supporting separatists and Western, rather than Ukrainian state.
I think one speculation is big, and the other is a little.
This is my ass, but it's hiding an immortal opposite in itself.
A.cz: How, for example, is one of the strongest leaders of the Perusian separatists Igor Bezler?
When I'm over the line of war fronts, I'm without weapons, and I'm showing to soldiers or weapons with a hot hand.
And I have both sides of these two hundred or three hundred meters on a man or in a optical spectator.
The faces of people who look at me, I'm always looking well... and they can ever pull up their weapons.
Leader, experimented Colonel with German and Ukrainian forefathers.
It is considered a Russian expert, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes Ukraine shouldn't exist.
And if so, just as the small government in the big Russian empe.
In any case, it continues to talk about it, and Ukraine considers an emergency failure.
Such a state should not exist, according to it.
Rather, he is an immortal enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we are talking about characters - in the Ukrainian television show, you've signed your Prime Minister Arsenie Jaceňuka as a weak, unconscious and fascinated "leader" that would do the best if he had gone.
I'll get at least five times fear in these three hundred metres of driving.
Why, then, should I secret with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak Prime Minister and that he harms our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in war in Ukraine?
Maybe you know the Ukrainians of Jaceňuk will overcome the king.
And the Queen is not in the sight of the Ukrainians the animal from which he would be afraid or should be in the remaining respect and authority.
His behavior directly copys the behaviour of the cup.
Maybe he's a good economy, but as a Prime Minister, he has no right to weep in the war in the parliament, to play with him his intrigues, to threaten that he puts it... he has to drive the country, control it and protect it during the war.
When the country is threatened, there is no premium for family, friends, rest for payable emotions.
He's the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
What about Jaceňuk?
It's like a pubert girl.
Yes, he's fascinated, but he's also weak, because he's never strong... he's afraid of Ukraine, he's just still getting on everything.
That's why he should go.
So much before, better for Ukraine.
Why the Galaxie Watchers couldn't save the markets
The 3 Sylvester Stallone returned from a 90 million budget in the United States less than 30 million dollars and Sin City: A woman for which I would kill only 12 million.

KLDR again threatenes Sala, since she repeated another short-flight crack
Northern Korea has put another short-flight racket into the sea, told Soul.
The data test of rackets has been performed shortly after the end of the common military managers of the United States and South Korea, which Pchjongjang has been prepared for invasion.

The South Korean Defense Minister of Defense, according to the DPA Agency, stated that the shooters were from the northeast of the KLDR and were flying to a distance of about 200 km.
Northern Korea, obviously, first declined from the racket from the province of Chagang, introduced South Korean media with the revocation of military circles.

A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man were released to the Tour of Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday-south.
When they didn't come home, the family's anxiety called about eight hours at the police evening.
It was sent by the puzzle of the local police and the safe team, and a couple was found about 11 hours tonight near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the man fell down, and then shot into her head.
The police stayed with them in the night and were raised on Monday.
In the stabilised state, they were transferred to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomo's brought from Opavy only a point, he had the exhibition on your leg
A 23-year-old forvard could decide, but it did not work in two largest chances.
After Âa, she first shot about three minutes before the end, but the place in the network ended on the Opava Joseph Flowers.
I had it on my leg, I had to give a chance.
I'm worried about myself," your boyfriend slept on his head.
"I was supposed to give it up under the age, a little bit of my head," he dismissed.
The Defense of Sigmy did not grant this Pope much, except Micul's income from 11 minutes, which, however, covered Reichlman.
Then they started pressing Hanacs, but they were not left in the crash block, and shooting from the remote got the Flower.
We compared 15 minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half time we were better, we had more of the games and Opava only threatened us by standard actions.
But your chance hasn't changed, so it ended 0:0, "the trainer of Hanak Leoshe Kalvod hated.
Popwa point also took due to absencies in a meeting, where Peter Vavřík was missing outside two hurt, with a three-shoot shot Peter Ševčik, who are hosting from Sigma in Sleezska.
This has not been able to replace them from their former policy.
The replacements deserve the absolutorium.
Sigma acted more basically, but we didn't leave it at one standard," mentioned the trainer of the Slezans Peter Baranek.
It was to see a lot of attention, aggressiveness and fighting.
It is likely deserved to be a good profit for us," he added.

But after the first time, I'm going to put him right now to watch him on the other stocks," Calvod laughed.
Al hated Benatka twice.
Film festival is different to the crisis
After a huge surprise over the starting film Birdman, whose register Alejandro González Iňárritu organized among the serious candidates on the Golden Lion, the next days confirmed that the interest of the 71th anniversary festival in Benátkáh had sometimes fallen.
Whatever because the number of places in the largest room increased to fourteen hundred, or because they followed the critics recognised after Birdman, but less attractive photos as a document on genocide in Indonesia in the 60s of the years Seeing silence and other films from the American 99 homes after the Iranian Pound, the films soon remained empty.
Comic jardins
Even the red cover before the festival palace had not been charged with such taxes as in the past and evidently stopped to get the problem for the last minute in the hotel.
The crisis in Italy is spoken more than anywhere and it is not surprising that it has reached such a weighted institution as Bennale and the oldest film festival worldwide.
Unfortunately, the crisis does not prove the lack of personalities, but the presence of films exclusively.
While younger fans were charged by the autograms of comic supergirls Michael Shannon and Andrewa Garfield, who successfully played dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations, the main opportunity to visit the Legendary Herce Al Pacina.
Moreover, he put it in two movies right now.
In the history of Transparency indicated outside the competition that the Oscar Barry Levison, according to Roman Philip Roth, has a 40-year-old role that is close to him: a heart on the top of the glory that suffers by depression from the end of the career and personal life.
But seeing him immediately the second day as a strange railway owner from a foreign town in the Manglehorn film, David Gordon Green, was really an unforgettable experience.
Volpi's coach for the best heric performance wouldn't have to pass it-- but the artist of Pacino's format needs prices?
Perhaps it is the greatest satisfaction of the love of the public, and of the Italian particular, because even though he was born in New York, Al’s proud is reported to the land from which his parents are buried.
Bodies for Italy
Lastly, the Italian movie has been very good in the Benadates this year.
The black souls, registered by Francesco Munzi, became after Birdman's first photo recompensed by a long distress.
The calabrian foot of mafia is observed in it by viewing family relations between clones that fight mutually for power and money, and the register has been able to make all the provisions for a good movie: quality scenario, camera, music and hers.
He also enhanced the Common Psychothriller Hlad heart, who touched Saverio Costanzo with Albou Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost his own child.
Instead, from French competitive movies, they did not expect heavy acceptance, nor Competition for glory, nor 3 hearts, both works affecting the traditional model of consuming movies based on the popularity of heretic representatives.
But at the end, two really excellent movies, so Birdman and Black soul, are not so small at the first half of the festival.
And maybe the festival pictures have spaces depression and subjects, the new picture of Peter Bogdanoviche called She's Funny That Way, a beautiful comedia listed in Benátcach without competition and inside the ́American festivals of 40 years, was able to lead to the relief for more than one day.
Policists captured in Prague Four pervitine manufacturers, carriers from Poland

The following drug was weakened, divided into plastic sockets and provitin sold.
With the transport of medicines from Poland or the sale of drugs, he has been helped by a 15-year-old woman who has not yet remained.
For this, she received a recompense from the organizer in the form of a third drug produced," added Rössler.
The criminals also conducted on the basis of the command of the judge of a number of home views where drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, packaging shoes, injection shoes, smoke and other helps and subjects that may be considered as a complete equipment for the production of metamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the evidence available, the police have found that the main organization has been seven times condemned for the ownership of a criminal action since 1995," the police speaker added.
The latter arrested in 2006 was sentenced for a criminal offence and a seventy-year-old mechanism, which has been charged with freedom, was nine times sentenced since 2009.
Even in the case of this, it was extremely for the ownership of a criminal activity.
The investigator accused three men and women of a misleading crime of unleavened production and other insurance with mild and psychotropical substances and food, which threatened them until the decades.
In three people, the investigator finally delivered the State representative and encouraged us to deal with the link where the judge finally placed it," said the speaker.
The fourth accused, seventy-year-old recidivist, ended on freedom.
His position and role in this case was not as important as in the final accused ones.
Police and this man are still working.

It doesn't make sense to disturb guys and schools.
Czechland has few generally educated people and also shows that gimnazists have good applications.
The beginning of the school year is here.
At schools in the last fourteen days, great preparations were running.

"France socialists should hold and give France right," says the key association of Francoise Holland

The changes in the relevant statements should be prepared and approved until the new leadership of the main city.
From the street of Prague, it doesn't escape any other herna and the city to limit the street art.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
The powder shall not reach October elections to prepare and approve in the representative's amendments to the relevant declarations.
"The Amendment Decision should not also make the current leadership of the city that ends the mandate for a few weeks," said adviser Luke Manhart (TOP 09).
To cancel the area of risks in its territory, the next weeks have decided soon a few advisers, such as Prague 5 and 7.
But Herny doesn't disappear, the risk report is changing at the time.
It's a new town leadership at elections.
Now it hasn't been technically achieved, for example, for the terms of giving at and similarly," Manhart explained.
He added that the last negotiations of the current representativeship, which must be approved by the amendment to the declaration, shall be concluded on 11 September.
References on the area of risk prohibition are required on the day of the municipal elections of the city part of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
It is currently prohibited by risks, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
A report from the same ways can be changed either in the case of the street art, called busking.
It is a challenge, namely Praha 1, which has already sent to the magistrate to places on which the current list of prohibited places would like to expand.
The musicians also don't want Prague 5 in the area of the Angel.
A regular statement of dog wedding in the city is going for a few months, yet it is not finished.
The location of heren and the problem of busking will solve urban statements.
Only the representative of the capital city can be issued or modified.
The Boards have only a advisory voice, and they can't give the calls themselves.
Last week the victory of Scotland independence in the hands of the representatives
The campaign for Scotland independence was in the danger that this error would make an advantage when she almost placed on billboards at the whole Scotland question whether Scotland wants to be rich.
But you will not get to the hearts of Scotch electors by calling on their money, nor getting their respect when you threaten them.
The moral of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, although only a few Scots are still going to church today.
Scotland has a longer trend to remove changers from the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The leader of the Scotch nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore, in the television debate, he repeatedly questioned his conspiracy, the Union of Darling, whether he is willing to respect "suvereign for the Scotch people", if Scotland elections voted for independence and began to support the single currency for Scotland and England.
This gave Darling the choice between the Scotch civil society and London financials, and with a grim falling into this past.
Of course, Darling doesn't support the mandate of Scotch elections.
However, the debate on what Scotland's currency will be neutralized has already been at least neutralized.
What actually motivates Scotland electors is fairness, opportunity, and defense of State health, who are free of citizens.
Darling supported the London banker in the matter of money, and also called the idea that it would protest against the health privatization.
As Salmond said, "he entered the bed with the conservators."
This is a very dangerous position for each Scotch policy.
Each Scotch elector knows that Scotch businessers are in bed with conservators.
This confirmed David Cameron, who spoke not to the electors in Scotland, but to the "boss" association, to the British Industrial Federation.
It begins to be that Cameron's refusal to discuss independence with Scotland Prime Minister Salmonde was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a white absent householder.
They would almost respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least could say that Scotland could be a successful independent country.
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's a physical pain to him.
What she reports is fair: Scots don't shoot and they have to accept what is.

The end was the best of the last week that wasn't gone anywhere, and we were just running up with the grandmother's summer, quiet before the storm, quiet before the stress.
New clothes when they got from Tuzex, the bottoms from East Germany.
Reading the Quick Schools, already deceived, switching around the Empireal to the back of Vary, somewhere to the tennis cuts, it was no longer hard, the sun was cold behind and arms, covered the papers on the diluted.
I'm still going to sleep until half a week, it's worse, a minute before I'm sleeping from a few minutes to two hours, then getting up to half the seventh.
He's coming on Monday.
Most of them don't breathe, but this year is deceived in the school.
Use in a flash light and look like a plastic place in the glass weight, there is the school, the United States A.
In the front of her old known faces and a couple news, a boy's higher, more darker girls.
There's gracious, they're gone, it's interesting, it's just how unfortunately they're here and how quickly they're here.
And these adults appearing girls who came to be cried, now laughing with something of histerical, like something changed in their life throughout the white, while I'm old.
And again the new firstborn, some nervous and other comforts, why are they all over here?
'Cause it's to be the educational military obligation.
So inside, the cold whale of the ground and the easily defect paw, the mope-scale schooler, despite the same thing, which, as a result, is the key of the pool box, where they are able to leave the teachers and who are still so small.

It's just from that idea, it's throwing a crack and starting the head pain.

The longest year has ten months.
And it's just the first day, now as years ago.
The born daughter let her die.
It is dangerous to the exceptional punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth was in March 2012 in the cabinet of public bathrooms at the bus rental in Jihlava.
Without a foreign help, she was born a girl who was packed in the prepared deck, hided under the bound, and brought her to the road leader, where she put her into a carrier with a few tens of meters from the street.
Family Travel to School
It happened to me sometimes before.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom in the bus, and I was born there.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
"I've been breaking the puppet's kidnapped with the necks I was wearing to school," she's described inquired and noticed that she was being pregnant.
"The next day she returned to the place, the child's body put into the bathroom and took her body out of the bathroom, packed her in the black igelite bottle and hided her and left her grandmother's house in Havlick Broad," she stated in the lamentation that it was not clear when the death of the newborn.
It could be in ten minutes, but even a few hours after birth, cutting the deck or putting under the bound, collapsing or refrigerating from the unconnected pupil.
The scenario was repeated next year on the jail.
A woman nearly undetermined from February to 12 April when the child's mortal was found by accidental witnesses under a crowd at the fisherman in Havlikkobrodsko, she was born secretly.
This time in a bathroom in a family house.
Without verifying that he was born alive, without breaking and binding a bubble that was round about the leg, she put the child into a few plastic packs in a cup of igelite and left it in the bathroom.
Once afternoon, he and his partner brought him to the fisherman.
Finally, he gave her a friend.
The father of both kids was just a friend sentenced, who, of course, did not know the pregnancy of the partner.
Even from this matter, they are not now before the court, he was only sentenced for a sin against the Sepulture Law.
It was the one who went back to the police.
I don't like that he's not being condemned as a partner.
He manipulated with the child against my desire.
I know that my solution was not right, but it came to me at that moment as a human," it didn't cover the deterioration of the wound that was probably subjected to a man's relationship and feared him.
In the course of his speech, a young woman spoke relatively balanced.
The tears in the sight of the lambs came to the moment when she talked about the relationship with the parents, from which she left herself after the full - year - old arrival.
She didn't want to kill.
"They follow me every 14 days to visit, do all for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried up.
I didn't advise my own equipment because I didn't want the kids, I looked young.
Furt, I wanted to put him into the babybox, but I don't know what happened I didn't do that.
I can't explain it to you," she answered the question of the judge.
However, she refused to act with the thinking and purpose of the newborn.
The second child was also born dead, according to her claim.
She didn't stop drinking alcohol even when she was pregnant.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I've even limited smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy had been seen in both cases, all of the repeated questions claimed that he had a health burden to be injured.
And that's the friends.
The Court of Justice will continue on Wednesday by the Court of Justice.
A sentence could already be made in the middle.
Women are threatened by a penalty rate up to 18 years of age, and, where appropriate, by an exceptional content.

Prodemocratic activists in Hong Kong on the day after the voting decision provoked by Chinese authorities
Nearby, a group of people loyal to Peking had a Chinese flag.
The Standing Commission of the National People's Conference on Sunday approved that elections in 2017 in Hong Kong would be attended only two of the three candidates.
All candidates must first receive the support of the nomination committee, which will probably be consistent of the members of the Court of Peking.
For the purposes of this Decision, the opposition democracy is impossible to reach election letters and take pro-democracy activisms to restore the promises and protect Hong Kong's financial centre of protest movement.
The political reform in Hong Kong is the main challenge, the Chinese leaders are afraid that the demand for democracy will be extended to other cities.
After that, in June, Peking has published a detailed report on Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, the democratic activists have organized an official referendum on elections in the special official district and hundreds of thousands of people have entered into the city trade quarter and put it in place.
The pressure of Prime Minister Li is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, several pressures were also to be discussed by the Chairman of the Permanent Committee of the Legislati Commission Zhang Ronghsun and by the Director of the State Council of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
Student activists announced that afternoon they were arrested before the Hong Kong government office.
In the last days of the colonial government, Britain has never changed the democracy in Hong Kong 150 years ago.
Putin requests Kyiv to start the negotiation of "State Sovereignty" with the Eastern Ukraine
According to the description of the Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked on Sunday to stop the Ukrainian government's fight against separatists on the east of the country and immediately started the negotiation of the "State Sovereignty" rejected.
His speaker Dmitry Peskov explained that Putin had not intended to indicate that the Eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would be part of Russia, but that their status in Ukraine should be overestimated that Russian speakers would have the right to protect their rights and interests.
Putino's call from the Government of Kyoby to act with the prorusian rebels as equals to themselves, corresponds to the obvious strategy in which it is conducted from the exhaustion of distress for five months ago: Help separatists to occupy the territory and grant the Ukrainian Government to grant the newly announced New York a real independence in order to connect the West to Russia.
In a conversation for the first channel, the State TV Putin condemned Ukrainian military action that had to re-acquire the East of Donec and Luhanska, which controlled separatists in March and April after the Anectoval of Moscow on March 18 March of Ukraine.
Crems and separatists recently occupied territory marked as “New Russia” or“New Russia” as a term referring to the glorious prerevolutional days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian Printing Agency Itar-Tass published the words of Putin's "illusion" everyone who does not think they are peaceful negotiations because Ukrainian politicians have started before Parliament's elections on 26 October, while government units attack civil residence in controlled separatists.
"In the interest of people living in these areas, we must immediately start significant negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of the company and on the status of the State Sovereignty of Southeast Ukraine," he declared.
Peskov said that Putinov's injury to State sovereignty was thought in the context of a wideer autonomy, which, with Kiye's leading a few months, is to reduce the concerns of Russian speaking from threatening cultural and language rights.
Peskov pointed out that the needed autonomy could only share the Ukrainian government with the east.
This is not the matter of negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "for this is not the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal Ukraine conflict."
The interruption of the vocabulary Kreml, which had to correct the "incorrect interpretation" of the Putin comments, highlighted the access to Russia’s leadership to solve the rise of separatists on the east, which is different from the opened occupation of Krim, where there is a double-million population in order to the ethnic Russian.
Moscow would have much more efforts to analyze Doneck and Luhansk on the east of Ukraine, since 6,5 million people are not Russian and public opinions, which have been held before the conflict, showed a wide support for the preservation of Ukraine.
The autonomy of Russian diplomates on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the right to establish their own trade agreements and international relations and, in principle, give Kremle real control over the territory that would link the Russian peʹna to Krym.
The Black Sea Halftone, anected five months ago, is the seat of the main Russian marine flottels, the sea trade territory and historical coast resorts.
The areas between Russian Rostove and Krym are also centrally downward, produced and fabriced, which produce important components for the Russian Army.
The Ukrainian President Peter Porozenko, during its in­surance statement of 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, consider changes in the statute that would give more controls to various regions on their financial and language status.
This vision of autonomy, however, is significantly different from the vision of Kreml and separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and enhancing violence.
Putinov's last invitation to act as separatists as equals followed after the next process of rebels last week after Russian units in Eastern Ukraine and the balls from the previous peaceful Asian Sea.
Separatised Russians have taken control of Novoazov's strength that Ukrainian security authorities are both afraid that it is to cover the strategic coast territory to Creme.
This has encouraged a huge civil and military attempt to cover Mariupol, with metalurgical combinations of 500 000 people, which lie between Novoazov and the strong income gate on the Croatian Halo.
On Saturday, the report was held at the meeting of the European Union's head representatives in Brussels and encouraged the action to prevent further Russian aggressions against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which is independent in the last 23 years.
"We draw close to the point from which there is no return," he warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign dances in Ukraine.
The summit of the EU has not made any definitive steps - leaders are invited to adopt further sanctions against Russia in the case of an unspecified scale of Ukraine crisis.
Colonel Andri Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday, said to reporters in Kiev that the Ukrainian soldiers had to download from their positions in Ilowa after the last week two colonies of Russian rounded vehicles and 1,000 military units came to Donekia to support obscured separatists.
From the 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were arrested in Iceland at the Russian invasion, they were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian captives captured a week ago in Ukraine, and he introduced Lysenko on Sunday.
In the scandal with discovered, Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disappointment over hackers, who probably stole his intimate neighbor Gabi Grecko and other influenced Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in a shock after the most scandal with hacked photos received a series of explicit photos from Jennifer Lawrenc on the Internet.
Hacker claims that he has sixty photos with a star of Hunger Games Lawrenc and other stars of Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, the song of Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Ley Michelle, and the herds of Kirsten Dunst.
As a result of the exclusion from iCloud, personal photographs of the Australian heric Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne Grecko were also made to the public.
There's 101 celebrites on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for his hand last month, said to the magazine Confidential, "It's unfortunate."
All private correspondences and private images should remain private.
It is a reason for personal information to be furnished and extended to the public.
Greek, who is now in New York, reporters reported to the online newspaper that hackning is "insulted" and those who became his tear, "softly humiliated".
It's as if hacker got a thirty-foto of Palmer with an ex-friend Scott Speedman for two photos on which he's going up without breaking up at the basin.
For example, Palmer inquired in a film of Love and honor where her protestant Liam Hems was.
Palmer, the star of the Chuck Strahovski TV series, and the herd of the Sucker Punch Browning's shot photos yesterday.
The Representative of Lawrenc TMZ said: "This is a private violation."
Herec Seth Rogen hacker on his Twitter criticized: “The publication of hacked phones is the same as selling stolen goods.”
The publication of stolen photos should not be tolerated legally.
The Fotbalist Sigmy's faced Lebra, even without winning
Olomo_ - Chromes and blacks that the Olomouck Sigmy Joseph Lébr's composer seated on his subject last week, seems to be the past.
They would finally have been brought from Opava to a point for free removal.
The club boss's seed and warfare, but they just got a little bit.
The money for payment could come to the club soon.
"I'm going to leave another story as I spoke about this last week, but I'm far more optimistic," Lébr confirmed that despite the won't seem to have Sigma, the players convinced her with improved performance.
The fighting and saturation with which we played mainly in the second half time was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I can forgive that he doesn't win.
When they played so from the beginning of the season, I am convinced we haven't lost yet," they think Lebr.
Sigma in Opava stopped the introduction pressure of homes, then the game was equipped and in the second half it was already better.
After the victory of Kalvod's convictives, they sackled, but they didn't reach their options, so they couldn't win.
Although the outcome is not according to our imagination.
We missed complete satisfaction but only one changed chance," Lébr said, but he didn't think that the change in the access of the Ballists only caused his exhaust.
There were certain more aspects there.
Whatever on my side, on the side of the trainer, or on the fans," Lébr said.
Sigma must be calculated with the pressure
The players were not wanted to comment on the event of the past week after the event in Opava.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to let it be," the young man Michal Reichl broke his head.
He completely left the question of Lebrov's statement from the last week of the attacker Václav Vašiček, who did not change the greatest opportunity of Sigmy in the Sabbath.
But he's just talking about pressure.
We're still under pressure.
Everyone wants to get out on us.
Today, we showed that when we fight and drive everyone to the hell, it's going," he said.
Warning to the heart
Leoš Kalvoda didn't emphasize that the preparation for the storage was not the most simple atmosphere that was dominated in Olomouci last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and today it was to see that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Although it wasn't even before they wouldn't want to fight and weep it," mentioned the Olomouck trainer.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It was before we compared to the strongness and realized what the other liga is about.
That it is not just about distress, but mainly about war," Calvoda said.
It's not enough to hope that Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I wouldn't believe it," added I.
