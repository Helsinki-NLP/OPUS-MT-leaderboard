The Prague Borsa at the closure of the market had a negative crochet.
After the morning hole, the Prague Borsa restored the losses.
The transactions of the CEZ actions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Borsa recovered from the hole of the day before it was almost 6%.
There's a crown of action at Wall Street behind this river.
Thus, we also show a market reaction to the result of the vote of the Chamber of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the stabilisation plan of the local financial sector.
Action crollo in Asia
Wednesday, the actions of the Asian Borse lived a dramatic crowd, though the indians, however, during the day later deleted a part of the losses.
The Hang Seng of Hong Kong's Borsa during the day has canceled almost 4%, but then a part of the losses stabilised at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises, who follows the movement of Chinese actions to Hong Kong, decreased by 3.8% while the seas were closed in Shangai.
Actions at Sydney's Borse lost more than 5%, but at the end losses were seized at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Borsa, according to the locality, decreased by 3.6%.
"The planning of salvation action is uncertain and this will affect the financial seas worldwide," observed the head of the Value office of Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite the part of China, is only the financial policy, so without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level of the United States.
The American legislators, according to the first Australian Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries also react to the consequences.
United States Action Strategy
The American Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan, for which $700 billion (approximately twelve billion Czech crowns).
The legislators have thus ignored the call of President Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would resume the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole.
The American action on Monday has lived a tragedy and the main enginees of the action have recorded the biggest croch for more than twenty years.
Dow Jones has been decreased by almost 7% and a crowd of similar dimensions has been observed lastly in 1987.
The vote was decreased before the vote, but it was seen that the draft of law was not approved, and it fell into free fall.
The Congress has ceased: the US government can extend $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have been granted to a larger form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators broke the loop in the dialogue on the approval of the safeguard plan in the form of economic for the American financial system for a total of $700 million (approximately twelve billion).
But it's not saying yet.
The representatives of the Congress therefore have defined some details of the understanding before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system's support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the Room of Representatives.
Thursday, the President of the Barney Frank Chairman of the Committee for Financial and Financial Services.
The Senate, according to some sources, could be voted on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economy, the announcement that will take place for the approving of the financial plan should be the first and lasting psychological factor that can wake up the seas.
However, it will be successfully returned to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, reach the sea's age.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've made a big thing forward."
"We have clarified our different opinions about the form of the market stability package," said Democracy Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to the same , the final vote could still occur on Sunday.
The delegates of the legislators gathered the night between the Sabbath and Sunday with the Ministry of American Finance Henry Paulson, to give the government's financial funds definitive form.
Funds should be used by financial companies to purchase non-cedible hypotecical goods, which lead to severe losses and risk the stability of the whole system.
"We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"There's still needed to carry out the plan of repair, but I think we're here," Paulson said.
The signal for the Asian trade
The global financial crisis repeat strongly on the sea of actions that are brushing.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, legislators are so trying to reach a definitive agreement on the Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the trade in the Asian financial marine, which are, in time, the first to influence the Monday market after the Congress decision.
But for now it is not absolutely clear when the two American Congress Rooms will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be arrested at the last time on some problems.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next days.
But the law will still take many changes.
The total amount for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But the Congress can block the rest of the sum in the case where it will have the impression that the programme does not perform its function, blocking the following $100 billion and after the ends of $350.
Bush appreciated the progress in negotiations.
Although the President can put the veto on this decision, the Congress may overflow its right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the programme has been maintained, which means to obtain funds to buy hypotechnological values, whose price is decreased because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not able to pay their hypoteches.
"We've developed everything.
The room of representatives should be able to vote on Sunday law and the Senate Monday," as the Republican senator mentioned.
The progress in negotiations is also satisfied by the American President Bush.
His portfolio Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with the positive approach of Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial seas and protect our."
Constraints of gold paracadutes
The President of the Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the main portfolio, said that the legislators agreed on the ability of the financial programme, the protection of contributors from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the interruption of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called gold paradotes for the leaders of the ascensions participating in the programme and establishing a committee that will control the funds.
They should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a big step towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and even for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relates to the owners of the houses that have problems with payments.
The Government should negotiate the new rates of hypoteches that will be purchased with the objective of reducing the monthly expenditure on debtor rates and allow him to keep their houses.
Mark: Psychological support
The plan proposed is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea, but its performance will be very difficult.
"And that's why we don't know how and what price the problem activity will be purchased
This will be determining how losses will be divided between them the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz site.
If the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of the next week, Marek, it is not so .
"More important, it is that the representatives of the conference already this week have found an agreement on the support of this plan and that they will make it soon as possible.
The psychological meaning of this agreement that will be approved is at this point the most important moment, "marked Marek.
Dual to last blood: MP3 readers against cellular
We will advise how to choose
While almost every cell can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this, it is clear that it's better to buy only the phone.
Yet, there are many reasons for seeking a self-readable reader.
The choice depends totally on the way of use and the requirements of the owner's future.
Perhaps you might hardly buy a high-quality giradisch to listen to the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
In the first place, these musical products are not like LP and from the qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason.
But if on your scaffles you're swimming hard-rock, jazz or blues probably, a gearish of this kind as at least you're dreaming.
Similarly, it works with portal music, that is, compressed music or in MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
For some, it may be inacceptable to spending for a 8000 reader, as a fan of the Pink Floyd may hardly drive the coffee from 20 corners of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
To decide is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than reading music, but they do not even make cellulars wrong.
There is no other device as universal as the cellular.
Along with primary functions, phone and send sms, you can read music and video, record both and have a photo, sometimes better and may also navigate.
And if we take into account the smartphones and the handhelds, you will also have a computer in a miniature.
It's a little miracle that no refrigerator can do the grid and no television can photograph nothing.
The mobile universality also brings disappointments.
More functions you use on the cell and first the weather on it will require the battery.
And reading music consumes much energy.
A few cells can read music for more than twelve hours, especially, and very less.
In this sense, music players (in particular the most simple) are much more effective.
As regards economic cells, they can take more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from when, some calls, seek to work for security another battery, it is also worth for the costest devices.
But you won't have this problem with a MP3 reader, even the worst last at least 9 hours of functionality continue with a reload.
Another problem occurred when you download music in the cell.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of devices has a USB universal port and no one can connect to the computer without a special software.
Music can certainly be registered directly on memory card, but only few memory readers are able to do it without a adapter for minicards that are not used in cells.
Readers,trains some exceptions (IPod) don't need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music traced USB from the computer.
Most cells and readers are created only a multimedia library based on the names of the interpreters, the album name, the genre or the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of the folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some true do both things (--ver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operational system).
Readers are easier to manage, cells can make more.
When you choose a special device, you are particularly interested in the resistance of the battery, memory, quality and type of audio output, and clearly of the easy to use.
If you need music especially from the background and if you listen to it every day only shortly on the tram, you have enough MP3.
This can be oral, clearly to any cellular.
You don't have too much to take care of what your mobile or reader formats.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format belonging to the most spread, most of the devices support music in WMA format.
The AAC is less (format used by Apple and its Ipods).
Best cells also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit the corresponding pages of the operator (or another supplier) via the mobile Internet and buy the song or album.
This same service may already be a valid argument to buy a mobile-reading cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited only to hit at the time of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But usually it is assumed that just this way of sale of music (whether through GSM, Internet or without filthy) will be dominated by the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry the cell.
Whoever wants to listen to something fruit in the bag while the MP3 reader remains forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on this, if you always carry the coffee or at least the aircraft without a ticket.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 players has.
Maybe the biggest benefit of mobile readers will be, for many, the price.
The most economic costs usually less than 3000 crowns.
For 3 and 4000 crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Normally, however, you will be limited by the absence of an income for common coffee.
Best cells and from the most equipped technical point and even with the use of 3,5 mm for common coffees, coast up to 15,000 crowns.
Instead, the benefit of readers is, beyond others, the easy management.
The most simple non-economic (see our choice) makes it really everyone to manage them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of management at a time with the common stereo or perhaps the giradischi, is obviously.
There is no danger to urge wrongly the start of the mobile Internet network and the result of a giant bulletin for data transmission.
What device to take
Also the most economic cells (e.g. Vodafone 527) have usually an interchangeable memory card slot (M2, microSD, etc.).
Even in the case of the acquisition of the respective card, included in the 2 000 coroners.
But take care.
Basic models only support cards with the maximum level of 2GB.
Only those most precious make it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy you a little MP3 reader, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the value (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most necessary listeners, you prefer to take specialized cells - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
The devices have individual keys for MP3 and the quality of the service is so close to the same MP3 player.
In this area, it has made more Sony Ericsson road, which walkman line cells have the same use scale as MP3 readers sold separately.
The MP3 readers of the above steps provide you the same service and the same price category up to 4000 corones, but with a greater memory capacity (to 16 GB) and the resistance of the battery (commonly 15 hours, in line of maximum up to 35 hours).
The first operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Maybe
Maybe the mobile phone market in Czech Republic is quite mature, and our operators offer almost all services like their partners in Western Europe.
However, there is something missing – a obligation operator to deliver them to decrease the price.
Maybe he's not gonna miss for a long time.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most dear in Europe, we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the accounts, it also confirmed the CTU, which noted that the price of SMS is from us higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming tariffs, there may be a paradoxal situation - for some Czech Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from the outside than home.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic remain so high towards Europe?
The answer is, the lack of competition that would really want to start the fight .
Maybe it sounds surprising, and there we have three mobile networks and covering highly over 100%.
Instead of the mobile telephony operators, it is a pleasure for the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, also the Czech Telecommunications Council head (CTU) , Pavel Dvořák, which has recently expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the operator traditions with his own network has no longer many possibilities. (The rest may be difficult to find other frequency).
But there is still another possibility - the operator.
The market income of the operators has brought a significant decrease in prices, which the traditional operators would have to respond.
At the same time, before the income of squals such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market, there were vows like us in Great Britain.
However, it has been demonstrated that the place for operators of this kind is there and that they can have real success.
In the end of the accounts for the examples we do not have to go very far.
In February of this year, we informed you about the arrival of the Mobilking Operator in Poland.
In only a half year, this operator has been able to buy more than 100 thousand clients and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group which in Czech Republic belongs to the other U:fon.
The benefit of the operators is the opportunity to focus on a much more concrete group.
In order to work effectively, there are many less clients than a operator tradition.
They do not carry out, namely, high costs for the creation, functioning and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus in the world, the operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and small price SMS, which is often balanced with the offer of the most rigorous services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cook at least half compared to its competitors.
But as shows the example of Mobilking in Poland, it can be a quite good move even the scoms on a group-building group not soon.
This operator points to that specifically on men.
"The true men choose mobiling operators that they like and who you can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this operative.
It is difficult to say if we can also say a similar concept as in Poland.
It doubts the press portfolio for Vodafone Miroslav Čepisk: "The Czech market is small for a fragmentated approach, on which most of the operators are based.
More than the point of view of services is satured."
In Czech Republic, there is no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost sure that if there is never a operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be the Mobilking.
"There is about the extension of this success project, but in Czech Republic, negotiations have no longer a lot of expectations.
Mobilking's accession will take place in the other countries of our area," said in a phone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studičková, the printing portfolio of the Penta Financial Group.
He thus confirmed indirectly that the current operators in Czech Republic are not very favorable to this thinking.
Instead, they try to do everything because you don't create any potential competitor.
Since a while, the GTS Novera group has not hidden its interest for the start of an operator, which would like to do so another way to become a real competitor of Telephone O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first it's better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this opportunity with all the Czech operators of the mobile network.
We have already been able to progress in negotiations with some of them," says the portfolio of the Pavel Kaidl group.
So maybe there will be better times.
Not official information indicates that the first operator may have to have it until the end of the year.
For now, however, it turns back to its creation up a unnecessary silence wall.
"Now we believe that there is the space for the creation of a full-titled operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific, in contrast to other maritimes.
Until now, no subject with a complete and serious project returned to us," mengted in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srszeň of the O2 print section.
The specificity of the Czech market also included other operators.
The T-Mobil Martina Kemrová's press portfolio adds in a rare agreement with O2: "For now we have not seen any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which you can continue to build."
And adds: "The T-Mobil network will hardly appear a operator until the end of the year.
Now we have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it could be considered horizontal."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather than on the reaching of its own licence requests.
Adds Miroslav Čepisk: "We are open to the negotiations of potential operators, especially in the share of costs and infrastructures.
That is what we consider, from the point of view of the customers, the most producer.
The main Vodafone strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
Competent authorities - with compulsory operators
The attachment of mobile phone operators can be easily understanded, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to the decrease of prices and with the decrease of profits.
Why then facilitate the access of such a competitor?
The faults return to the creation of U:fon testify that when operators hold a good thing to stay from the same side.
Perhaps the big pressure pressed against the THU during the U:fon creation period towards T-Mobile company.
This testifies public access information from the THU web pages.
But now U:phone needs as an argument for which you do not accept the operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition environment of the mobile phone market has been lowly enhanced by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator in the market.
As regards the typology of the mobile market in the Republic of Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entrance of another competitor would put on it and especially on its high-precious services."
Dell’s attitude to mobile telephone operators is, however, really amazing the complete disinterest by the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not only the attachment of the CTU which, despite the Great Britain and other developed countries, has no power to interfere with economic competition in Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this has taken its typical position against all the problems.
"The entrance of the mobile phone operator on the market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract on the removing of the infrastructure needed between mobile operators and operators.
No such contract has been concluded until now because the offer of potential acquisitors was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," Christián Chalupa said, of the section for external relations UOHS, in response to our questioning.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not occur.
Instead of the office to defend the interest of consumers and to deal with the fact that no one uses his position on the market, it is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the outside where the operators usually work, we can note that their market income has contributed to decreasing prices for mobile phone services."
Of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the reduction of prices does not belong to UOHS interests.
It is truly shocking in all the situation that is the almost emo-harmonia of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question is if it is really just a coincidence, it is putting it alone.
Similarly, the same benzine price for all benzines is the fruit of coincidence and competitive fight.
"The section has not found any signs of anti-competitive behavior about this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so he has no more ambition for his behavior on the market.
The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile network market for the operators may also miss the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many controverse points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the significant marine analysis made by CTU, according to which telecommunications are on the basis of economic competition the only market.
On a such market, obviously, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some juridic experts offer another approach - for the creation of an operator is always needed the agreement of the exercise of the network.
And the mobile operator has - at the end of the logical accounts – the monopolie of his network.
So for a certain part, it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, UOHS should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators do so strangely similar.
At the same time, the complaints of the interested parties (that is the GTS Novera men) show that during negotiations with all operators are very similar obstacles.
Downloading the chain in the telecommunications in the ČTU is a quite common truck with which UOHS is out of the whole face.
This is what we already found in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the extension of CTU's rights on the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law, despite the fact that many experts were expected to improve the situation.
This is the fact that UOHS representatives must know it more than well, but their interests may be elsewhere.
You can do when no one looks at
While we do not see the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators, some of them are even in the Czech mobile networks.
It is an extension that publishs their lists of prices for mobile telephone services, but they are only partly public.
It is usually agencies that are occupied with multilevel marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a series of others offer their mobile telephone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually obtained only by the providers.
The magic is in fact that the company is a classic company client, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important client then receives special price offers (and another).
The problem is that the trade conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators are prohibited by such prevention.
"If the cases you are talking about, which we are interested in, it could be a violation of contractual conditions, and it could focus on the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová answered the question.
But it is so unlikely that such activity did not reach the ears of the subjects of mobile telephone operators.
In particular, in the cases of the three men'asses, thousands of customers can be treated.
No operators are at the same time from a view of this kind.
From the activity of these aspects, a non-individual profit and at the same time - in contrast with the true operators - they are not harmful in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepisk warns about possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, but only a disturbable percentage of customers uses the services of these areas.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered in their name, so they can't be full of it as customers of mobile phone operators "
But this should be a minimum strange in the CTU.
Moreover, another question is open for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes before such a attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient powerful rights to dismiss similar activities and if he doesn't want it should not be satisfied with the interpretation of operators who have no idea of all that and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not costless anymore
As stated in the text, the income of mobile telephone operators on the market has brought a significant decrease in prices for services.
At the same time, practically in all countries where the operators were born, the operators traditionally tried to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small market, too saturated, problems with the quality of services.
But in developed countries in these cases, regulatory bodies have been intervened not from mobile telephone operators but from their customers.
Or with the formal measures either with the non-formal pressure, then he joined the creation of the first operator, and others joined him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies start from each other all the case as a painful patata.
For our experience, we cannot avoid the feeling that the uncleanness of the powers in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But we don't throw the snake.
If the backscene information is fair and the operator really will appear quickly from us, the Czech mobile phone market will be backed back.
If one of the operators had accepted the creation of a mobile operator only difficultly UOHS could remain inappropriate to the decline (disabling) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling to higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech inno has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the yellow in Czech.
Sunday, Prime Mirek Topolánek at the occasion of the Czech State's Day of Judgment presented the new records of the other in "Kde my housev".
The new registration of the other was made by the orchestra of the Teatro na′ under the direction of Jiří Bałohlavek.
There are four versions available – asol with the masculine or female voice, coro and the instrumental building.
The canto is under the direction of Catherine Prizjinková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the other reviews are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.ch site you can listen to all four versions.
Whitehłavek considers the song in Czech one of the most beautiful others.
He already said to the "Chesky rozhlas" radio that has chosen apely to sing the variants alone, the songs with the most representative voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care of both of them and the core, have the clear word, that the text is well understandable, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the nineth of the year will celebrate the next year on 175^ anniversary.
The song "Kde homev my" was first sounded in 1834 on the stavovské divadlo palco in the original operation Fidlovačka of Joseph Kaietán Tyl accompanyed by the music of František Škroupa.
He bought popularity and people spontaneously made it.
The first strife of the song after the foundation of the Czechoslovakia in 1918 became the natural part of the inno na.
It remains one of the seven symbols in it even after the birth of the Autonomous Republic of Czech Republic.
How the "new" is sounding
Wednesday MHD of Prague will be with you for the first time with a electronic tear
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it will be written in the Prague Transport Company's history as the date in which the metro, tramway and bus will rise up the first passengers that will have a electronic tear instead of the paper ticket.
Currently if they can search for it about a hundred million people who have their Opencard tears .
The passengers can buy that from 30 and 90 days and year (which will be from the first January 2009) and at the same time reload their letter in the Infopoints and in the Offices of the Transport Company and at the stop of the metros Museum, Mostek, Nadraža Holešo ·, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajska garden, Kacherov and Luka.
The shoppings can be purchased from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers have benefited from the service before afternoon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget sports in the metro stops where they had to do long files for paper tickets.
The sticking buys it via the Internet and on Opencard downloads it on one of the twelve branches of the municipal library.
"In these places, passengers have a personal sport that will make interested in the accommodation on the Internet and will also register the credit bought on their paper." said the portfolio of the Martin Opatrny project.
Furthermore, in the libraries it will be possible to load the electronic sticks on Opencard in ­omat and evener_ which are installed at the metro inputs.
How are these homomates?
They are red, similar to the ticket losers, and passengers have already observed them at the stops of the Rostyly metro, Buōovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city, but until the end of the year they should be eighth," Opatrny concluded.
The sticking will be checked instead of the autist from the ́omat.
The service that will work from tomorrow is very much.
Just insert the Opencard box and before paying the knife, it will be loaded up.
Electronic teases are earnest from tomorrow, not only in the capital but also around it.
That is in the city lines of trains and bus from number 300 to 499, which the communities of Central Bohemia take to reach capital.
"In the trains added to the integrated transports of Prague, there are the collective monitors of card readers with which they check the time and area validity," he explained the method of control of Philip's billets from the Ropid Organization, which points out the times of the collective transports of Prague.
The urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated in the box of the ́sta.
So the surface is needed not only to show the magnetic paper to the stage, but more needs to support the Opencard at a given point attached to the box.
Thus, the chair checks the validity of the dear knifes.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the dear tickets, there is nothing more easier to ask this type of information to the stage," Drápal added.
The passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the sticking is expired, can go back to self-services, where the sticks are loaded on the paper.
There will be displayed information on the validity of their documents on the device.
The Germans of the Sudeti wanted a referendum from the United States
The Germans of Sudeti in 1945 asked to include Shumava in the United States.
This results from the letter de ́a letter in the Scientific Library of the South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the United States patronate.
With this desire, as it is said, some German groups of Sudeti were returned to the president of the United States in 1945.
This also results in all the letters contained in a private and today de ́t in the Scientific Library of the South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter to the American president request not to allow again the return of the "district of Shumava" – occupied by Hitler in accordance with Monaco agreement – in Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that the American units arise in the German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in the letter signed with the words "The people who hold the destination of Shumava with all the heart."
Because, they say, the accession to the Czech Slovakia – knowing the character of the Czech - gives the Germans hope only to the brutality, lack of incomprehension, oppression and slave, the authors of the letter pray to the American president that the protector on Shumava now and forever.
"We can't believe that without regard for the opinion of a fourth million inhabitants, you would have done this territory as a state for us foreigners, who oppresses and disgraces ethnic minorities and has not contributed for anything, just for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," it writes in the letter.
The reason for which the authors cannot sign it is the fear of the seat of sales by the "Clean Oppressors".
If the President of the United States had to doubt the conviction of the Germans of Shumava, it would simply organize a referendum on the will of its residents to become part of the United States or to live under the standardity of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem close to our knowledge of the history of after war, some witnesses describe properly the expectations of then the Germans of the Sudeti.
Although the German Czechs should at least intuition that it would be their movement from the Republic, only few of them admitted a totally like this.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would negotiate a kind of autonomy for the people of the Southern.
Others believed that they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Republic of Czech Republic.
He was mobilised during the war as German of Boo. In the sea power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the britains and placed in the prison field in Holštýn, the tens of other German Czechs went to find him so that he teached him the Czech.
"These thought that once the Czech returned home would make him comfort," said Chalupa.
Never of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia the pima of war, he stated that on the basis of the decrees of Benes, they would be moved by the Republic.
You don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack autists
The most costly action in the Czech history of the road security.
It could also be defined the emotional median campaign, which the Ministry of Transports intends to leave Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Rebiček's office, it is expected that this delays the drivers from a dangerous behaviour to the flight.
The campaign of 150 million will appear in television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flights.
The autists should be removed from the quick and under the effect of alcohol to the flight.
And remember him too to put the cinture before he leaves.
To touch them in consciousness, especially young autists,motocyclists, pedons and not for the last professional leaders.
What's going to happen in the puzzle?
Especially the stories of people who will face emotions.
And that also testifies the slogan "sanguinos" of all the campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "n't think" is largely written on the tower.
And in a pocket of blood, there's the word "You'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can pay with his own life in a moment of employment.
The spots will "spaven" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglosason countries, where images are usually seen with drastic scenes of accident victims.
It is so promised to reduce the number of accidents and dead on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Carotes and bastons for drivers
"Con autists, the carote and bastard system works.
The carot for them is, for example, when they passe with the red and thus spare time.
The baston is the danger of the torture or incident.
It is necessary to remember the risk of guides, " says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transports Martin Kořán of the Hospital Na Homolce.
And therefore, we want information campaigns in the printing, and especially negative advertising, the psychology believes.
According to him, the pains that warn the autists of the danger are already less effective.
"If it has been installed the fixed panel that warns about the danger, it will probably be confused with the environment soon, and the leaders will not give him any more attention," advises Kořan.
Olmert would return almost all the territory occupied in the exchange of peace
The first of the Israeli prospective government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the refund of practically all the territory occupied in 1967, namely the borders of Jordan, Jerusalem east and the heights of Golan, in exchange of peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that has published Monday, Jediot Achronot.
"D we have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, that means that it will be necessary to return almost all areas (occupated), if not all, " said Olmert to the daily.
"We're landing a certain percentage of these territory but we must leave the Palestinians the same percentage (of the Israelites), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any refund would also include Jerusalem east .
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want the rushes or the spinners to bring him, as happened to one of my best friends, to reject one part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the accentum to the two attacks of July in the city, during which some people have been wounded and tens of wounded people.
According to the first, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historical places", which are within the Old City. .
"He who wants to keep Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
The removal from Golan's height
Olmert also spoke for the removal of Israel from Golan's height, which is, according to him, the unnecessary condition to conclude this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require a certain effort from the part of the European Parliament.
"I don't propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of Golan's retirement," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to refuse to get Golan's heights.
They will have to reject their relationship with Iran; they will have to reject their relationship with the Hezbollah (moving the Sciites); they will have to reject the permanent support, which offers the terrorism of Hamas, (the Sciitis movement) of Al-Qaida (the terroristic network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the first.
Questions after the incident: Are stewards illegal in the bus?
The law doesn't have them, you can't walk on the bus that takes long distance
In the context of the tragic incident, the Italian city of Padova del pullman of the Student Agency has come out the question whether stewards and passengers can move at the bus board during the course.
"If we want to respect the laws seriously and formally, the Steward's activity is in conflict with the law of the road circulation," says the Portfolio of the Minister for Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The incident last week with which a 22-year-old hostess has been caused by a truck that has cut the road to pullman.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting at that moment at the lower safe place of the pullman, although there were two other signed places.
But the bus can make an accident or breast-feed even in the time of the distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether the bus is placed or not in the feet according to the circulation book.
If the passengers are not approved, they must sit down.
Student Agency's buses have no feet, confirmed it at the current site.cz the director of Radim Jančura.
"We have evaluated this with the Minister and at the beginning it has not allowed the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it has been revoked and we have concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the course if they have the place signed," he expressed his viewpoint.
The law doesn't hold the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law takes care of the regulation of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the transporter to carry out services.
The Law of the road circulation is only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and needs are not defined," adds the portfolio Hanzelka less clearly.
Instead, the Director of the Department of Road Circuit of the Ministry of Transports Joseph Pokorny considers that the law cares enough of this issue.
It depends on whether the bus has the positions in approved feet.
Everything here," he says.
It categories buses in urbans where there are feet positions and the maximum speed limited, interurbans with feet places with higher and longer dealing, without feet positions with the maximum speed for and seats of security circles.
Like in the air, he says the expert.
The BESIP expert on Straight Safety Jaroslav Horein doesn't find the background problem in the movement of stewards on the bus.
"The situation can be compared to the service of aircraft during a quiet course.
Not even there is safe when a turbulence comes and the flight assistant can break the head."
"If the bus makes a frenade brush, obviously, the laws of the physics are earnest.
Like in the city pullman or on the tram.
The transporter must restore the safety of stewards with a internal regulation," he also claims that the problem is not resolved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport that offers steward services.
It's about two hundred.
Even after the incident, the director considers their dangerous job.
"I won't have the feeling of having to consider the profession of Steward as a dangerous work, I will abbolize it.
The passengers can get coffee and newspapers while they leave.
They would also decrease the costs," he says.
The director of Asian Alexej Litvin, who manages a line fraction in respect of Student Agency, motivated the absence of stewards on its means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hostes, we've been opposed to the beginning.
Before or then he will end with an accident of death," he said less than a year ago Ttyden.cz.
A great tragedy has occurred.
In the incident of the Napoli line, a young hostess in the Plzeň region was killed, which had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck is probably out of the emergency course without using the arrow and locked the road to pullman.
The leader of the pullman tried to avoid it with a brushed hand, but he shot it with the front right.
Jančura refuses the fact that the two places reserved at the rest of the stewarts were busy.
"You can't keep these places in long-treatment pullman, they are inevitable."
The dictate is in mind to denuncia the autist of the truck.
The Agency will not wait for the Court's judgment to pay the damage to the girl's family, but it is expected to be a financial responsibility by the responsibility.
The revision of the law?
Not in View
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts of the Ministry of Transports for more than one year works, could lead to precision of the movement of stewarts at bus.
"They have not reached any concrete results, however.
They are not so many pullmans, they are more occupied of the pointing system, the maximum speed on the autostray and the use of the cell during the drive," says the expert Horein.
"The Transport Minister does not consider the activity of Stewarts as a great threat to the safety of passengers," concludes Portfolio Havelka, that the control of bus safety is the competence of police and security offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf point on Francofort
The words are not missing in the letter of the WestLB's director inside the householders.
In the letter published Monday that could be "the centre of the capital market of the financial group of stock cases" through the meeting of Düsseldorf's units with the Deka-Bank of Francofort.
West LB would launch "a competent block" with hard profits in such a company.
In addition, all such unions could be a decisive incentive for further links in the country banks sector.
This is read, when a administrative advice in difficult times wants to demonstrate action.
Because the WestLB distress is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the EU committee but also through the Ente na® for the financial monitoring service, noteing a long ago the regional government of the North Renaissance - Westphalia that the time is to look for a future solution.
Deka-Bank, which the same clients of the Risparmio Houses already know because of their investment funds, and WestLB certainly has already spoken of this for a while, even from Francofort.
At the end of August, he referred to the Deka-Bank Franz Waas head to the presentation of the first half of the year that a fusion of the house near Magonza with an appeal like the Helaba or the West LB does not mean.
However, the Deka Administrative Board, which is halfly brought by the regional banks and the consortians of the stock cases, delegated the Administrative Board to conduct West LB on common contracts.
This could be market negotiations or parts of them.
However, talks have, as they say in the business market, started.
From Deka-Bank, with its 3000 persons, is one of those who count more in Franceforte business markets, not the first time they are talking about when it is to consolidate the storage case sector.
In 2003, for a short period, Deka-Bank seemed to be based on the region of the Renania-Palatinate and Helaba.
It's not done anything from this three-party association.
As soon as the projects were published, the Asian region was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two records were also unable to reach an agreement.
Instead, the Renania-Palatinato Regionality went to the region of Baden-Württemberg in Stockcarda.
And they have always thought about us for a Fusion of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end of Günther Merl , president of the Helaba Directorial Board, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
In addition, it seems that cognition is created and that it is necessary to draw close to the different houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a first meeting of the Landesbank could be held with the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, it's not a good news.
If it increases the pressure for other fusions, the partners will miss.
In the south there would now be the Juneor partner, although he has yet overcome the financial crisis much better than houses in Monaco and Stockcarda.
The Association of Reserve Cases Assia-Turingia participating with 85 percent of Helaba has placed the challenge at the meeting with WestLB.
It would only remain NorthLB
Geo-strategic reasons are only one account.
On the other hand, there is also the issue of how the various affaristic models of the single houses are combined.
In the month of Merl noted that at the decision-making question, with which the future of the regional banks would be assured, there would not have been yet been a response by the association of German reserve cases.
Finally, the division of West LB could also come out, which is naturally not desired.
Thus, the letter of the Administrative Board expresses the will of encouraging in any case to a "general resolution".
You will see how the collection of individual parties with Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to the Italians
For Elena is the first time for Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present to the party as a companion, and so he says that everything is different.
Their bathroom at the 5l of the Kaiser mark is in their feet a massive barbout and shows about 200 travelers which are the deep tons that can produce from the goal.
Elena before Luca's got a cup and after a throat.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking at the Porta New station, they leave tonight at 23,45 four mails with Monaco destination, Festa della Birra" , I arrive 6.30 hours.
Three mails are reserved especially to the Italians, in another only Brazilians travel.
In an angle of the parking, the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so sound, says Marco, that it's not what for the Italians.
Board that carries a long cappot with fucking pellet and a couple of eyes with the silvered width steaks belong to him.
Since five years, they go to Octoberfest, this year they're three tours.
The night-in-law, day to feast, comes back at 22.30.
It would only create unusual expenditure, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the travel, the welcome of the brindis with the beer Kaiser, made in accordance with the standards of Bavarian accuracy, the box of illness and the German guide – Mark has attended a German course in Francofort.
And so night by night buses go on the Brander.
There's no beer yet.
I guess the silence falls in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better, they will still need their strength.
They are standing in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian buses in the A9 road do a short pause before Monaco.
When the Mark's group arrives at 6.30 at the parking at Theresienwiese, there are about 50 buses in Europe.
Elena, Luca and the other group, Marco explains the attack programme last time.
First: put the yellow hair.
On it on the left, "Oktoberfest" is written for the Internet access of the Marco Travel Agency: "Knowing.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the tent of the beer, it means to run!", quoted Mark at the first morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places under the tent.
"Not forward, he sent down locks, and not all the yellow yellows sitting on the same packets, dividing into the relative space!"
The mouth cooks 8.25 euros, calls Marco.
And don't forget to give you the crap.
"Demonstrate the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they disappear!"
Third, "We'll meet again here at 22.30 points tonight!
He's gone for the party.
On the road a attack as follows the yellow trees, the road cards and even a advertising map of a large popular bavarian party.
You want to be ready to take away.
It's the second weekend of the festival, known as "the end of the Italians".
Exact data are not available, it is spoken of 50 miles, which go through the Alpes and invade the tendens, and it is asserted that 10% of the visitors are coming from Italy.
The Police of Monaco is strengthened with 7 agents of the High Adige, Italian volunteers support the red bavarian cross, which makes a statistics on nazionality, where the Italians come to the first place with 200 medical treatments before English (approximately 60 medical cares) and the Austrian (approximately 80).
In particular, the Italians loved is the tend of Hofbräuhaus.
1. Laughing nights for the Believes of the King State
The German Financial System is stable, confirmed the Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician has used the word "relative" and has also appreciated that the German sector is not saved by critical developments.
Because the crisis began the end of the week.
The real estate financer Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, receives a billion credit from a German bank consortium to protect them from maritime turbulences.
One expert person said to the Kings Monday, the support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate must only pay the interests for the requested part.
The money comes from private banks and from public banks.
In the bottom are the losses of Depfa's affiliation.
The state financer, according to a newspaper article, has been refinanced in a short term – which is no longer possible because of the challenges on the sea.
In the first half of 2008, the reservations of the European Union were decreased by 95% of EUR 2.37 million, and the share of the capital was also decreased from 1.6 to 1.45.
The current income and net income from financial affairs were fallen to 0 compared to the last year, the benefits of increasing requests and certain actions relating to the liquidation of credit credits have been decreased by more than 70% of EUR 5 million.
Only by higher income from the compensation refund of subordinated restructuring of the ex-group Depfa and from the refund of interests under the single text of tax laws and the management of business for immigrant consortiums, the negative profit was sufficiently moderate with about 16%.
The former public financer after privatization in 1990 was held in the speculation with commercial immobiliary credits, which were scored in the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic state financing was too low, the Depfa was committed more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of common projects of private and state investors (PPP) and was internationally diversified.
Hypo Real Estate now must kill the value of the officer, which will have a material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that the dividends have been deleted.
In 2007, 2/3 were reduced.
The Hypo Real Estate after Depfa's absorption is a major financer of the State and infrastructure.
It is more than refinancing on the market between banks compared to other institutions because it does not have customers' confidentiality.
Because of the American Investment Crown Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the grant of credits between banks in large has been acquired because the banks accumulate liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate every year needs part of the Depfa credit portfolio – approximately 50 billion. – short-term refinancing means.
According to the Hypo Real's advice, the group's financial funding has been covered by the credit for a certain period and the undertaking protected by the influence of the internal sea for the most unemployed.
From other sources it feels that the refinancing is guaranteed by money until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Director Committee said, in contrast, that the HRE Group will not need a short time for the monetary sea.
The Bundesbank and the Nate for Financial Surveillance Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE Group is still insured.
This is expected for the aspirators and the believers.
In view of the dynamic and insignificantness of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The financing may not be completely used.
But the contrary is not to exclude.
After Sunday evening, as long as it learned it was to fail, the momentan salvation failed to calm the souls.
The 75% of the EUR 3.30 is a cross currency.
They regain the courses of mutuals quite well.
While the previous debts are almost inappropriate, they cedone the courses of debt.
In particular, the mutuums of the Württemberg-Hypo Affairs are broken, comprehensively, the deficiencies with expiration over 2009.
Before the mutuals of the HRE seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, their validity now must, after strengthening the banks' crisis and the institution itself, which with Depfa's significance the crisis has occurred, be considered to be aware of the stability of the internal financial system.
In addition to when central banks, governments and less damaged banks are still ready, it can be counted on a deterioration of the years within the term.
Or it comes to function, what no one is disturbing to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
However, the information reported due to partial statistics has become a fairly certain hope.
In particular, it will create long-term investors a few nights without sleep with the decision if they are divided from their commitments.
Slow-term investors may conclude the report of losses for the future payments of the compensation rate on increases.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of the school should be presented to Tachibana Highschool, girls start riding: Germany is completely "kawaii"!
What does it mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Japanese exchange log.
The first school day in Japan
How I was emotional.
I also had the fif of going to school.
I live at Tokio margins to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes with train to reach Tachibana Highschool.
The way I had to find her alone, and for fortunate, I didn't lose myself.
The beginning of the first lection hour does not seem to have been fixed as we have in low Sassonia.
Schools arrive a plan from 8 to 8 until at 8.40 begins a short time with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before the lection started, it touched me.
However, I'm not the type that speaks voluntaryly before people, more than a class of 40 schools
Since I haven't had the uniform school yet, I'm a old girl of the guest mother, along with a cocktail, blue bottles and black skin scarpe.
I put my clothes in front of the catedra and tried to say good: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- I call Sylvana, I come from Germany and feast between a week and my anniversary.
At that point, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have bisbilled, laughed and made a sign, and then I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lessics of Japanese girls to survive and means "carino, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl stumbled for me, she was a honor to sit at a exchange school.
The rest of the lection time was still, but when he sounded the gong, I was stuck in the true sense of the word.
Everything was disordinately talking and ridiculing and cutting me with questions – then it's really difficult to understand the Japanese English.
In the pause, everyone opened their Bento.
My guest mother also made me the lunch panic-- it's different from the worst German pans.
I had laughed with species, salts, cetriol and alge, fruit and a species of involving meat and tofu.
I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
The things seem strange and have a completely new sadow.
It's done, everything's really good.
Maybe other than the cups set under salt, brirr!
The Bento are not only the dinner at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a Bent made since it, prepared enough artistically, with the hope to make the boy's knowledge during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga fumes.
I'm really interesting if you can find out.
"Why exactly Japan?" My friends asked me when I told me that I would like to go for a year at school in Japan.
I always said,
"Why's my fascination?"
Finally, I've been reading the Mangas for years.
And to understand better the smoke and culture they contain, I started learning Japanese a little bit.
I was fully convinced to come to us once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, use and costume.
There's a lot here.
On one hand, Japan is a place of technologies and last trends - from the opposite side: hard, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokio is the biggest city I have never seen in my life."
1. The rats also have feelings
A bit or a scarfy flee when they feel the danger.
The scientist Joseph Le Doux neurologist has convinced it: even many animals have feelings.
4. But how can it happen if, when they behave in our own way, they have the same feelings?
In the Internet newspaper "E" for some years, articles of scientists have been published.
6. SPIEL ONLINE in a series has answers to the question: "What do you think it's true, without trying it?"
I think animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else too to be able to test it, because we can't even prove that other men have conscience.
But in this case d we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we respond to other species and ask questions about feeling or generally conscience, we enter into an unfair territory because the reference base does not match.
When a short is in a dangerous situation, he does the same thing that the other animals do. That makes it possible to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
People behave in such a way, since some scientists realize that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make us difficult to transmit our feelings to animals.
From one side, the prefrontal cortex often connects with the human consciousness, the associated circuits (this for its direct access to the short memory and the executive and control functions).
In the man, this large area is much more developed than in the other primates and it seems that it misses completely among the other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness of the prefrontal court, including the knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, it is thus admitted that the human assumption is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic specificity should be presented in the way of speaking about man: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said that it is linked to consciousness.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on the tongue, it would influence it so that, as it is done, the conscience of the animal is certainly very different from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to discover how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If you can't measure it as an internal and subjective thing, by analyzing it through your experience because of the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
The majority of the interpretations refer to the content of the scientist experience, but there is another aspect of the conscience in which science would be easier to access.
The processes of the consciousness of animals can be analysed without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization.
Therefore, for this principle, Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, it goes first to the neural coherents of the conscience that cause mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the visualisation.
What, then, does it mean for feelings?
I call them to the fact that a emo-system as the fear is activated in one of its conscientious activities in the brain.
So what we indicate as "fear" is the mental state in which we are located when the activity of the brain system (or of its consequences, such as the body's reactions) takes the work memory.
Seeing that feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates, and particularly human being.
With the speeching nature, we create subtle disturbances of hearing, because we can distinguish and category the actions to describe them to others.
In respect of this Antonio ́io, for example, thinks that feelings result from the most primitive activity of the regions of the body of the feelings of the cortex and the cephalo palone, like Jack Pankseep, which, however, focused more on the palocephale.
Since this network during human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
At a clearly theory level, I can't oppose it, however, I think it is insignificant.
Pankseep brings arguments on the fact that what for rats and human beings appears as fearful, you probably do so with feelings in both cases: but how can you happen, if rats and humans prove the same when they behave similarly?
A scarfing in the case of danger flees as if he felt fear?
In my eyes, the likeness of behavior can not yet demonstrate any vital similarity.
And the neural comparison continues to be: rates and human beings have similar paleonencefails, the scarfs not even a brain.
But is the paleonencephalo for feelings?
And when you could also demonstrate it for human beings: how would you like to demonstrate it on rats?
I think rats and other mammifers, maybe even the insects (who knows) have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are very different from us (as human conscience is based on specific circuits and languages), I prefer to study emotional behaviour rather than emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there are neural progress here, in agreement, that you reject the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don't do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This can be considered myope, but I prefer to do some advances, rather than continually swallow against a wall.
I'm a practical emo.
President of the EUFA Platini: Return for Poland and Ukraine
Prime Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct position of the President and Prime Minister.
"The Government views Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said
"This, however, is not an amnisty for our country.
The work is started and there is still much to do in both countries"
Both householder countries are designed in the road table for the construction or rebuilding of stages, streets, hotels and ports.
Eventually, the number of stages to reach the Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't make more time.
Now d we have to work with the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Gregorij Surkis Association.
"the EUFA will keep on looking for us"
A more radical halt has been made in Poland.
After a number of scandals, the direction of the Poland Association PZPN was suspended by the Empire Committee in a position with the Indian Administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee gathered on request by the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"The serious danger that the PZPN is not to operate in accordance with the rules," Drzewicki said to the Poland Information Agency PAP.
"In a letter we assures the President of the EUFA Michel Platini that preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
A number of exponents of the first division only at the last season were condemned for manipulation, and at the end it had even been to return the beginning of the Law at the last time.
Dennis Quaid injured ripped
He wanted to promote a new movie, in the interview he talked about the private and now he's great with the ex: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star declared adulter his ex Dennis Quaid.
He's wrath and rebuke.
War of the Roses at the expense for the former couple of married Meg Ryan und Dennis Quad: Seven years after their separation, the two actors in Hollywood now dispute with one another with a bad litigium - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time expressed about the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis has been my long infidel, and this has been very painful."
The delivery of traditions you would have come to know it only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "speaking of the soul" was the work with Ryan's printing for his new film "The Women" – the history of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to her publicly declared adult husband was clearly disgusting: he'd be "injured," he said the fifty-fourth century in "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the next time repeat and repeat the story of our report".
It would also be "deplorable" that to Jack, the seventy-year-old son they had together, again "remembered publicly pain and survival, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives from the separation alone, Quaid is married again and will shortly become father of Others.
So his judges shut up with the arrow: "My life goes in every case.
I feel lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
The prices for air billets and hotels are covered
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnights in Europe were more economic than the year.
In Germany, according to a study, flights would even be more economic than 50%.
Flights and overnights in the hotel have become more convenient - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analyzed its data on the reservations of the first half of the year 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter, the second quarter observed a clear delay.
After the holiday market prices have increased for years, the overnights in many places are already priced.
Since January to March, prices are decreased in 41 of the 48 European cities in average of 6.9 in comparison to 2007.
However, from April to April, the prices were already over 3,6 % lower than the year.
The most evident trend would be in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year ago.
The American Express sees the weak quotation of the dollar, which would lead to a "warming desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Francofort and London would also be touched by the recession of hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with a increase of 26.3% are even in the record in Europe.
In the first quarter, the trend is still indicated in the following:
As a result of the recovery of cherosen, the Economy Class passengers had to pay 7.1% in average compared to 2007, long intense fuel flows would even be up to 29.2% lover.
However, the prices of the Economy Class's air billets have been cut in the average of 12.5% compared to the trimester, the first class and the Business price changes have been greater debolised.
In Germany, prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
Since January to March, prices ascended from 11,9 %, the second quarter decreased by 23,6 %.
As regards German internal flights according to the study, prices have even been half.
The reason for price crossing would be the economic growth in the above part, explains the company.
The request in many segments of the air travel market has been decreased.
On the other hand, it would be through the Open Heaven Agreement, which liberalizes the air traffic between the uses and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the elimination of non-rentability rates at Airlines, as well as the high number of air companies that in the first half of 2008 would declare failure – only in Europe it was 24 air companies.
HSV's Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV of Amsterdam becomes capolist.
Al Borussia Luhukay is not still able to find a group of 11 who works.
Here Christoffer Klein worses the landing of happiness for the na' Marko Marin's owner.
The Gladbach's holder first entered late in and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was formulated accurately, he passed his lips in a way convinced.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," he claimed Hermann Rieger in the cabin coverage of Amburgo.
It wasn't happening even though in the catacombs, the pause was finished and most of them sat back at their own place.
Rieger has been for almost 3 decades of HSV physiotherapy, enjoying an even greater estimation than some older.
And so his currency also found listening in high areas.
Cornelius Jol's assistant alenator announced and raised the pool in a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the Alenator Chief of Amsterdam Martin Jol.
It must have sounded like this: here is the second goal!
The change of position has not occurred.
"Today, it wasn't all good to see," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt would also "will be more relaxed."
For the 1 to zero, those in Amsterdam must thank the testing signed by Mladen Petière (11) and the fact that many debilitars of Gladbach did not have been able to do bad to the debolitors of Amsterdam.
"It was a black victory," he repeated Martin Jol.
The SV of Amsterdam this Monday will be 121 years.
The spectators have already celebrated before, on the Sabbath afternoon, if themselves, the blue sky on the aran and the lamping class on the video screen, which legitimately legitimates their sports society as before the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We're able to make everything right," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the presentation that the provisional table certificate is more indexed than the previsibility of the campaign than the domination of its HSV.
The square with its new entrances later – the Neves and Silva Brazilians, the defensor of the Port Pet; as well as Jansen sofiated to the FC Bayern – finds itself slowly, but it has not yet been able to guard.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," restarts Jol.

Dark material influences the flight of space sons
Since years, a mysterious phenomenon creates perplexity among scientists: Dark material affects the speed of space songs during the so-called Swing-by hand.
Experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einsteins' relativeness may not be exactly.
The spatial sond Ulysses has fled through the space for almost 18 years.
Because of fuel tubs that quickly congel the death for congelation is now on you.
Among the scientists since years a mysterious phenomenon creates disappointment – the anomalia of the/or Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight manager of space sonds, with which they are obtaining additional swimming/spint/scilling in the gravity field of a heavenly body, for example, the Earth.
So the songs can save very burning.
The Euro-American research survey Cassini-Huygen has used this physical exhibition as well as the Ulysses sun-sound.
What surprises students since years: the races do not behave all the way we would expect under the gravity law.
It also comes to irregularities at speed.
Sounds become suddenly faster or slower.
Until the physicals couldn't explain this effect.
The year's repeated Swing-by's announcement.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativeness, which describes the force of attraction of the material with a curvature of space, may not be exactly.
The American Physician Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton believes firmly as before Einstein was wrong, and trys to explain the anomality of the Swing-by through the such dark material that the astronomers have warned in the cosme.
"Anomalia's responsible may be the dark material that could also be very much on Earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark material, space students have only known for about 10 years.
It is obviously a force of attraction from you, which affects other heavenly bodies.
Instead of invisible, she is not sending or reflecting any electromagnetic radiation of sort, especially with no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark material is at least a good fifth of the whole mass of the cosme.
Tourists captured in Egypt are free
After 10 days in their sequencers, the tourists captured in Egypt would again be free, as the Italian Minister for Foreigners confirmed.
The retractors from Sudan had requested a number of million euros for redemption.
In a shooter before the release of 6 sequestrators have been used.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were captured.
The redemption negotiations are already in progress.
The Germans are always in the middle of the sequestrators.
WE ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists captured in Sahara are absolutely free.
This has agreed with the Egyptian state television, the Arabian issuer Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the cronica of the Italian TV issuer Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other obstacles have been released.
We're looking at their health status," said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, he referred to the Egyptian state TV.
The 19 components of a sending in the wilderness are already on the road for Cairo.
The backscene of a shooting occurred before the delivery of obstacles is not yet clear: so the rapitors after the indication of an Egyptian public security agent would be ready for the conclusion of the rape before the Sudan army killed at surprise 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed for a ransom," said the officer.
It would be "only treated to take advantages" when "This surprise" suddenly arrived.
Sunday sudanese soldiers in the border area between the Sudan, the Ciad and Egypt had used to fire-arm 6 of the rapitors and captured 2 of them.
The sequencers had expected from Germany a redemption of the amount of 6 million euros; the money should be given by the German wife of one of the obstacles.
The journal "El Masri El Jom" refers to a German intermediate, the release of obstacles would be late, because the rapitors were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the sequencers wanted to free women in stock after the payment of the redemption.
The men would have to stay holding until the rapeers had not had a safe way of escape.
The German ambassador to Cairo rejected a position on the report .
The patriarch's abuses brought to suicide.
Years of abuse by his father brought a woman to kill themselves, he declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old from Stithians, Cornovaglia, was in prison for 6 years after accepting eight cases of aggression sexe.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly disappointed his daughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel for his death."
The Court learned that Mrs Randle was used in her home at Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at 34 years of age.
When she was a kid and lived in Coventry, Trerise hurt her and blessed her before having sexy relationships, while the mother was out to work in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the eighteen years, and he returned to live in Cornovaglia.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs Randle, who had spent a long time as a voluntary to the National Trust, was tortured by the abuse they had caused her.
In 2006, the Public Ministry Ramsey Quaife said to the court that Mrs Randle's friends, who was a good surface and cyclist, was "emotionally dead", and that he had "mocked with life".
In April 2007, her true father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It seems that it is usually sucking yourself with a plastic tube.
Mr. Randle comforted the father of his daughter, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "The law and I blessed her."
"I didn't disappoint her.
I feel for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise, "You're a very strange feticist, and for her victim she must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This wonderful saga ends with the victim that takes away life.
More hard is the fact that if he had not done it, it would be difficult that the facts were completed before the court."
I note the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother described have had on their daughter in these years.
Otherwise, it was clearly likely that she was a promised and happy young successful.
The officer who has the data will be punished.
The officer of the Cabinet Office who left the top secret documents on a train must be held by the Official Secrets Act, has learned the BBC.
The man was transferred by the Defence Minister when he left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were signed to the police.
It is the less delicate of the accusations made in accordance with this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal intention.
The corresponding BBC Frank Gardner said that the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They'd have thought this was treated internally in the Mode and Office," he said.
The employee, which cannot be appointed, shall be held under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the protection of the information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer should be held by the metropolitan police because of the highly high nature of his work.
The documents that lost contained assessments on Al-Qaeda and the safety forces of Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and brought to a hidden place.
Building companies face the B&B account
The English building companies could face a account of more than 80 thousand £ after the salvation of Bradford & Bingley.
The Government has given 14 billion sterlines to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.5 million sparers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all agencies that take the money of the sparers, including the 59 building companies.
The Director-General of Building Societies (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion sterline loan will eventually be paid when Bradford & Bingley's mutuals will be redeemed.
But the interest that will grow in the meantime will be paid each year to 700 financial companies that take dei, but the interest that will grow between them will be debited each year to 700 financial companies that accept dei.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed the BBC that the 59 building companies would be included in that number.
It's irritant that those inhibitations that have been behaved in a way that now is called to pay part of the account of those inhibitations that have been very less.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each enterprise had to pay in proportion to the deity that he had, and that companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest in the loan will amount to 450 million sterlines in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million sterlines to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of Construction Society Association, said to the BBC that he believes that it is injust.
"It is irritant that those inhibitations which have been conducted in the home market in recovery are now called to pay part of the account of those inhibitations that have been very less decent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We must examine all aspects in the next weeks to see what options there are to protect building companies and their members from what might be a significant account," Mr Cole added.
The interest in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest of a whole year will be due and this may be almost twice higher.
Since the building companies are mutated organisations without actors, their members are finished to pay the account through higher tariffs or lower interest rates on reserve accounts.
The sweet milk at 5 penny per litre
People in Jersey are faced with the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in prices at the inground of his milk for a additional five penny litre from Monday.
It is the second increasing price this year, after two penny increases in February, and it comes after a research brought forward by a advisory company.
Detailers must decide whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increasing February, the price of inground changed for the last time in 2002.
Reject the assurance to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court of Bangladesh refused a request for the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's care, which means that you could be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyers said that the Court refused to grant her a guarantee for the exemption of 50 million tax (729.700 dollars) to a businessman when he was a member of Parliament.
The case is one of the many accusations of corruption that strike us against you.
The political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, has been released in caution at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next weeks but its party, Awami League, asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military days before the total freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was going outside for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, if she can stay free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that it will be called to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has rejected the request for care for Sheikh Hasina by adding that you cannot have the caution because it is already in the outside of the word for medical care," says its lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present an appointment against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs caution to return to the country from the foreign to prepare the elections of December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October, a senior leader of the Awami League party said Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the military force of the government took power, but she was released to go outside to receive medical treatment.
So Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all accusations against themselves.
Further fear for the Afghanistan Anti-Poly campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent campaign of immunisation because of violence associated with the Taliban, says the United Nations.
The United Nations has introduced a vaccination programme in six provincies last week.
But it is said that you can't reach children in Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A United Nations portfolio said that this happens despite the promises of the Taliban that would not attack or prevent thousands of staff transporting vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the legal chain with ITV
BSkyB has its legal share with the Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the ITV reval TV station.
A BSkyB has been told by the competition court to cut its actions in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that the participation of BSkyB prevented competition and allowed an injust influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the BSkyB participation acquisition in ITV seems doubts about the ITV India, making it possible that the Competition Commission launchs an investigation.
The chief of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that forceing it to reduce its ITV stack was unreasonable and a disproportionate medicine - particularly as BSkyB had said, it would override its voting rights.
New investigation on the case of the United States Prosecutor
The American General Prosecutor appointed a special Ministerial Public to examine the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the General Inspector of the Department of Justice criticizes the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and the former general prosecutor Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was made out of the fear that the prosecutors were removed for political reasons.
The Special Minister Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the investigators in question have lying in trying to prevent justice.
"Series accused of potentially criminal behavior have not been completely investigated or supported," said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to conquire witnesses to witness was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions from the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that lawyers were released for expiry performance.
But later he said that the lawyers were not evaluated more expiry than many other colleagues, leading many observators to conclude that the release was motivated by the policy.
Some of the prosecutors were involved in the judicial action against republic members of the High Profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the offence of fraud to the damage of democratic electors.
The American prosecutors are investigating and bringing further causes to court on account of the government.
They may be released at any time, but they cannot be released for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, the general prosecutor Alberto Gonzales, was then in the storm for releases, and finally draws his position.
Some of the other officials of the Department of Justice were released.
(The report of the General Inspector was very critical about the role of Mr Gonzales in the case, saying that he repeated a primary importance in the releases, which he had rejected his role as leader and was extremely disturbed during the process.
Other officers, including Bush Karl Rove's senior assistant, were criticized because they did not have investigations.
The Epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at Q Awards for his inner epico Bat Out of Hell.
The song, who will take his special gold premium to the ceremonie of the next week in London, said that he was "honored" to gain the profit.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track of the album of Meat Loaf in 1977.
Coldplay will carry out nomination for the premiums of this year, being in the list of nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, the editor of the magazine Q, said, "There are some songs that move things like time and kind, and Bat Out of Hell is no doubt one of them."
The song, composed of Jim Steinman, requires a strong voice that was delivered by Meat Loaf.
He opened with a tool section that was almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the fifteenth place.
But the Meat Loaf Bat Out of Hell's album remained almost nine years in class and he will sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - the true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart failure in 2003 after he has been killed on the pal.
In 2007, acute larings forced it to cancel concerts.
Later he had a ciste on a voice cover.
Dark city roads, often forgotten and maybe soon in sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, bulevards, streets and other circuits, some of them, other only useful.
But also many veteran taxists and residents long ago find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, more than because they have never heard it.
The small road is in East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet of width and 120 feet of length, it looks more like a powder vicle than an active roadway.
There are no travel signals.
It is usually impossible to see it on a normal atlant.
The road, however, must have our owners.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of recently built luxe buildings on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner for shops and boots that should be opened in the new buildings.
Other amateurs have included neighbors long-term who say they have been held from the trio-trail because it was one of the last residues of the ladies' quarter of the past.
But the department of the city's preservation and development, which has the road control, doesn't care to keep it.
A meeting of the Committee on the Use of the Territory of the Communal Committee of the Circular, some representatives of the city Agency and Avalon Bay have denied a proposal for the Immobiliary Society to buy roads.
But the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and asked a new plan to present the next month, says Susan Stetzer, director of the Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left in the property of the city, and we want the city to continue to possess Extra Place," said.
"There may be the proposals to system it and manage it, which may be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that he wanted to reopen the small road and install places to sit, including some to use for a coffee to which the real estate company expects to gain the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at the meeting of this month.
Michael de Milly, a portfolio of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that he wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this disfellowshipped vicle and transform it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Portuguese of Preservation Apartments, said that it was in fact the desire of the city to sell the road and noted that the purpose of the Agency was to develop the property rather than to administer it.
In comparison to his most colored Character, Bowery, Extra Place left a historical print.
Some believe that they took the name in 1802, when a large agriculture company possessed by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and the stretch of land was not recalled.
The back door of CBGB, the rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road may be better known as the set for the photograph of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The land was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who made the photo in November 1976.
"It was a cow of immondity, clothes and pieces of bottles, poster, sheets, corners."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "gentrification" of East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, thus adding that the part of public property, modesty as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare – a town fragment almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog named Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The book of Lamentations: A little nostalgic view of the city in the way of extinction"), published a part of a Discours of the town's history appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a living anangle without output, dark also of day and delimitated doors of iron stores and windows with saracines, with old weekly newspapers that swallow the lowers."
With a few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rate running aggilly through the back of the street to a door that was driven within the CBGB, which is now the site of a aristocratic clothes store.
His walls were graphics and a empty beer bottle from 22 once below to a group of fresh newspapers left.
Some people said that they rarely thought about Extra Place, but they suggest that it would have to be a little disappointed.
Mr. Fields said, by his own part, that some people think also undervalue the attraction of the road into their state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in black, dark and disgusting places."
The Billing Debat: Education in English
In this point of Educational View, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingue education.
Lance T. Izumi, an older member in the California study and the senior director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-one of the book "Don't good as you think: Why the media class needs to choose a school."
Really drawing the Spanish electors is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "the African-American and Latin students have significantly less probability to diplomate than white students, "what is true.
In order to fight these deficiencies in reaching objectives, Obama's educational plan is specifically supporting, among other things, "traditional bilingue education" for English students.
And the question for Obama is whether its commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the teaching in different languages than English, does not take into account its interest in covering the official languages.
Let us, for example, take Sixth Street Prep, a elementary school in the East County of Los Angeles.
School students are for most Spanish and low income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of students did the higher level test in the 2008 mathematical state examination.
A similar amazing 93 percent of the fourth students have tested expert levels on the artist-di-language-English.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from the favorite of Mr Obama.
Sixth Street highlights the recovery and exercise, constant evaluation of skills and a view of the type "no excuse".
Moreover, and here Mr Obama should notice, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street, the obstructive approach of the school for English students is "full engaging".
The use of English emphasizes the use of English almost exclusive in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to the bilingue education, said to me, "We have had a fantastic success with a student coming from Mexico and if you were entered in class 12 months after you wouldn't have been able to identify what it was."
"Fun'a," he observed "for us it works."
Obama takes a school like Sixth Street Prep to replique it in other Spanish majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved from the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Others is a long-term supporter of the bilingue education) and its steadfast support for the budgetary education prevents the answer of Mr Obama.
While he agrees that the immigrants should study English, Obama has recently made the issue banal when he said that people should stop worrying about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are going to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these achievements, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than dispute or banalize them.
The oil is brushing and renews the economic fear
Oil prices have been decreased brushly Monday because of concerns that even the American Saving Plan for the Financial Seas may not be able to increase.
The future of the greenhouse has fallen from 7% up to 99.80 dollars at the New York Market Boss in the morning operations.
The prices have spent more than 20 dollars at the barile since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the seas of the primary materials have been cut off from Wall Street's financial agitation, and from a few powerful uragans in Mexico Golf.
After reaching a piece of 145.26 dollars at the barile in ̈, the prices were crossed up to almost 90 dollars at the beginning of this month, before it was raised again, on the background of a tremendous incertainty in the financial sea.
The anxiety influenced investors again Monday even after the Congress leaders said that they had reached an agreement at the end of the week about the saving plan, the largest of the history.
The news was darkened by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from the past.
In the last episode of the progressive fusion, Citigroup will purchase Wachovia Corporation's operations, said the Government on Monday.
At the same time, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European Fortis financial conglomerate.
The Barclays Capital analystes said that the frenetical negotiations at the end of the week had brought to a salvation agreement " seems to have failed to live the feeling of the market.
While the economic situation is worse, it is expected that the question of primary material, including oil, will be calm.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and marine change rates has become uncertain," the Deutsche Bank analystes wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that the primary materials will not be required to escape to the county.
From a perspective of the primary materials, our most pressing concern is to the point that the American virus will spread globally and specifically in China. "
Analysis has decreased their expectations for the next year while oil consumption of houses due to the slowness of economic growth, reducing the previsions on the price of oil and gas by approximately 20 per cent for 2009.
The exploit in the second fourth marks a square record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform at the last eight and more sessions, defensor Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he looked forward to the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets had transformed a game without points into a top.
"You see something like this," Ellis said.
The fourth began after the Jets and the Ar’na Cardinals had equated the grid of the minous clouds that overcome them with a fashion.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon where their growing synthesis has made a gigantic advance.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns in the room, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I haven't gone out of my way," said Favre of all the ways coming to Coles.
He's a fantastic guard.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing plays, the mass was tragically the quarterback of the Cardinals Kurt Warners.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis interrupted a vagant launch and restarted it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
The safety of Eric ́ith has planned another guard and has intercepted it.
The Linebacker David Bowens forces Warner’s fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most notable.
The Cardinals went in advantage of that ball ownership, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had recovered the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely caught a meta from 20 yards, for a benefit from 34 to 0.
It was more than Jets ever signed in a quarter.
When you were asked to describe your foolishness, the Jets Eric Mangini coach said, "The second fourth or the third fourth?"
When it was told him both - the Jets have granted 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I like the second fourth more than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a small time zone."
Running Gebselassie over his world record
Heile Gebsellasse of Ethiopia has shown again because many consider it the best marathonite forever, breaking his own record in the world to the Sunday Marathon of Berlin and becomeing the first person to run a course of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the course favorably planning at 2:03:59, Gebsellasse sends its score of 2:03:26 for 27 seconds, last year in Berlin.
At 35 years, Gebsselassie presents the 26th record of the world of a so unbalanced car that has produced a world campaign or a world record at every distance from the mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebselslassie dropped Pechin's marathon, fearing - maybe in a too alarmant way, in retrospective - that the air inhibitment would be worse in its asma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - solved and 48 degrees at the department, 55 degrees at the arrival - Gebsselassie won Sunday with a middle of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mil.
Not half fundists like Gebsselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have gone to long distances, the marathin record has fallen more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, Gebsselassie told the reporters that he had the cramps on the pulp two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not argued.
"I'm so happy," he said to the reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at the end everything went well."
It was a little critical - especially in Kenya, the east African rival of Ethiopia - to have exhausted his claims, generally avoiding many of the best marathonic stars in the world, counting on adequately as if it was a middle-based charge, and putting the records of the world over the sense of competition.
But these critics rarely decrease the size of the skills of Gebselassia as marathon.
With the falling of four Kenyani Sunday, Gebsellasse reached the half road point at 1:02:04.
Two elite kinean runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have kept in competition Gebsselassie after his apipists were ours.
At least more than three miles from arrival, Gebsselassie made a final impennate to separate from Kwambai, which ended at 2:05:36, improveing his best personal time than almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's garage, Irina Mikitenko, the Native of Kazakhstan, which now is German City, completed a great year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time of ever.
Paula Radcliffe of the Great Britain holds the record of the world at 2:15:25.
Last morning, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a winner of surprise from London Maratona at 2:24:14.
You lost the Pechino Games with what is described as a bad incident, but it is healed to win in Berlin, making its best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon he has run.
You've run a garage by making the calculations well, allowing a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan running with a great distance, taking it back after approximately 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya ended the third at 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
I hide in the park on the subborgs of Orlando, a few miles from the brilliant, from the voice, from the great, down the quiet city where the pride and complications of African experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first black city integrated in the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer like it described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good nutrients, a lot of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrim place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora year! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most ambiguous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
And in many ways, the city that he described - and that stops the tourists including it in the tourist guide of Florida produced by the Federal Writers' Project - remains a part of it.
It's so indispensable, dignified and private as it was in the 30s, when Hurston wrote that the rural black in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little of us, you don't know what it's losing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential named Senator Barack Obama has been called for an opening talk on the race, many here remain disgusting from the outsider's view.
"We are very careful about how our story is recorded," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident from all the lives and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be gi."
Eatonville has been long defined as a paradox of trionph and difficulty.
It is a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2.400 where the poverty rate is twice the average.
It is a literary center but also an example of the shadow of the rural culture of the Southern black - sometimes disdegnated, sometimes premised - born by the American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are proud and protective.
And the anxiety about Eatonville's imagination really started with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her birthtown through sincere books, rich dialets, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five sections of Florida's guide transformed the city, outside the Rout 17, a road running through the often forgotten centre of Florida in a black story scenario and human drama
Low as a greencasse in life and in literature, Hurston brought the readers into the store owned by the first office of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then devoted him to the most private areas.
"From the road to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, marron with white refining, with its well-heavy gardens, which Howard Miller was always studying, thinking he could read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Dash's widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells well of all kinds and whatever is suitable to the rooms of the guard".
So in a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with analfabetism, second no and sex.
It was clearly not of Fodor.
In fact, it wasn't a retract that everyone appreciated.
"Now she said how it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortally cited men who sing gross songs about their wrath.
Add, "Some people don't like."
Hurston is still remembered here as a living excentric that often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembers that when Hurston pitched in the city, he normally arrived without advertising in a chevrolt trion, smoking and wearing bottles in a city that also benefits from dignity clothing today.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were crazy.
"The people were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But he added, hanging on his chair on the backside side of the Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was probably ́happy, "he never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were out of the print.
Like the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although once it was a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in a tobacco in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorative ceremonies, and no large conferences.
"I don't believe they understand their contribution to the world or their leave to all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapbed in Rainbows," a Hurston's biografie published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County's officers wanted to switch a five-course route through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main road in two courses.
Orlando's extension has already spint the Interstate 4 through the west border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still retaining from a difficult period of his history.
The forced integration, in addition to other things, had ended the related ideological isolation of the community
In the fifty years, the racial mixture was hated at the door of the community's house.
"In that period, a group of white boys came and threw arance and things to people sitting on one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who remained usual from that one time.
They threw a cocomer out of a car."
In a letter of 1955 at The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, determining its decision in Brown against the school office "a greater insult than a honor for my race".
The residents now say that the department of schools, despite having been positive in some aspects, expands Eatonville's cohesion and repents the confidence of his youths.
"The black kids were used to be dressed - I remember this - you dressed your teacher tomorrow, covered your teacher tonight," said N. Y. Nath, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the Executive Director of the Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This dured, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't cover your white teacher because your white teacher-- I mean, there's a cultural division there," Mrs. Nath said.
Civil rights, in any way, make and create space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black, actor and artist who overlooked the prejudices, as he did, with joyful security of himself and lines as: "How can some reject the pleasure of my company!
I can't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker started a long road for the tomb without the Hurston tobacco and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, a claimed biography on the Hurston of Robert E. Hemenway put the library scaffles back to the American canon.
The autostrade's project arose just while his most ambiguous daughter had re-traveled the lights of the rebellion.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a saver.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what he could destroy the state with his autostrade.
Thousands of fans came to the event two years later, and every January, many return to the memory.
A lot of years later, the state returned from his project for the road.
"The five courses of the resurrected autoway, have brought what you would say the high speed, a real proud for the city," said Ms. Nath.
Mrs. Boyd puts it in a more way, "Now saved Eatonville."
The victory on the autoway project has helped to change the idea that the city has his own.
Those outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to the church in 1993, began to appear in a long number, and the residents began to revaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public history record in 1998.
A new library on a single plan (as Hurston, obviously) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard repeated and disappointed.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomalia of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, it can give the sense of a secondary road under the extrem rain, small as when it was founded with 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800.
(There is 90 percent of black today.)
The outsiders who come to search the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are still treated with caution.
A previously requested permission is required for most of the interviews, to some things - such as the walls of the oldest church in Eatonville, drawn by a white man, which makes black men in the fields - they don't have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for the red red, are still afraid that their island community will be frank.
And, not Hurston Festival has spread, it has also taken a high level of citizen orgy.
Young people, especially, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw all her race: big, problems and everything, neither better, nor worst and proud, creative, big worker, foolish and confused as other ethnic races and groups in America.
It is honestly a citizen who can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's grandmother, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who is designed to return to Eatonville after the college to work in the local government or for the Department of Police, which he said he might need to.
And also those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11 years old from Winter Park, seems to have learned to describe Eatonville properly.
"Too many people, if they entered here, they will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing against all the other,' said Alondra Kenon after the last Sunday.
"But if you really stop and learn a moment to look at the story, it's really a funny city."
Here in New York, all of us speak fluently of financial.
In the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed far away from the newspapers and from the big TVs of Times Square, they would not be in the eyes of the cycle.
They would never know that the glass offices, with a nido of app over their heads, bankers and he-fund managers who monopolate New York live every day the worst "broke day in office" from the 1929 crown.
Factors shoot the cars of metal for the the through the marciapies, transporting muffin boxes for dinner meetings.
Latin-Americans draw the feet between condoms, carrying, like human mulls, 50 and broken rocks, close to a baston on their shoes.
The employees are still waiting for their morning bagel at the feed carriers on the martyrs, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It seemed not that there was a true crisis, until, with all the discourse of ruin and triumph, I decided to open a new book of storage Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the fact so that it coincided with the late afternoon pause at my office of JP Morgan Chase, a break of about 20 was already waiting in row.
Not in front of the cassier sport, to retreat money or to do de ́i, but in front of the customer service sport, where old customers have books of accommodation, tourists ask directions for the large magazine Macy and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are before me, then I would have learned from Starr, my "confident bankier", were in line for my own reason.
In contrast to me, however, they have already taken the stocks from the smallest banks from the places from which the pensioners make, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from such thrift (small as a building company), credit partners and types of citizen spare banks whose branches operate only within a state, and they say they treat customers as family.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In the past days, Washington Mutual, a 327 billion dollars in active, was under the controlled administration, and, while the Newyorkees were moved home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another, Wachovia, with 440 billion reserves, was searching for a buyer who saved her.
The employees and workers who were in front of me, imputed for another ass, were moving their money to a secured gate, which is asking for more money at Wall Street.
Common newyorkees in the last weeks have become competent in financial.
A woman at my supermarket Chinese confidence, talking to the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the lady was failing, and to her embarrassed Director-General Dick Fuld throughout the family, as if she was laying out a big partner.
And Lyn, the portinian in uniform, almost fifty years of my condom, has changed the subject in respect of our normal discussion on Brad and Angelina or the consequence of my expenditure.
She told me, after my visit to the farm, "Now I have all my money in market funds!.
I changed, I'm not running any risk."
The musulman tomb is profane while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, at the left of the Austrian right side of the Freedom Party and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian Vlaams Belang Belgian party, participate in a manifestation to present the organization "Cite against Islamisation" in Anversa, Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry signals of types the Moschee Road Representants with a red line that goes through.
The police committed the right extremists for profaning a Muslim citizen in Austria, the same week as the political parties of the right extreme have gained much to the general elections.
More than 90 tombs were severely harmful in the Traun cimeter, in Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in which the police believed that it was a organized action.
The students traced the Jewish spray symbols like David's Star over some tombs, but the detectives believe that it was a trial to mask extremist motivations led by hate for the Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in some way linked to elections.
A portfolio of the local islamic community said that they were "deeply stupid" from the news of profanation, which came to the end of Ramadan, a month of religious importance for the Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria was shiped in a spiritual research travel after its right-hand parliamentary elections of yesterday.
The two extreme right parties who have taken nearly 30% of the votes, the Austrian freedom party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have made a campaign with a very anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans have been defined by xenophobi critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party who won more than 18% of the votes, has made a campaign against the winds and the burka and has also expressed his opposition to foods that are considered as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brothership" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to flag the construction of moschees and minerals, thus indicating that they are political symbols of a continuous islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Inquiries and analysis are immediately made after elections, which have established the right extreme as the strongest political block of the nation, indicating that the change was advanced by young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel to the foreign forbidden to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the glamour star of the abuse rock on minors, was prohibited to travel to France and Spain from the court.
The judges set the six-month division in Glitter after he had informed the authorities that controlled him to want to go to Spain through France.
The prohibition of traveling to the foreign was granted to Kent's police last Thursday after he had delivered the judges the test of Glitter's arrests for abusing minors.
Glitter, the true name Paul Gadi, was not present to the audience of Ashford in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyers.
A portfolio of the Court Service said: "June 25 September at Ashford's pressure, Kent's police submitted a request to prevent the traveling outside Mr. Paul Gadd in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present."
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities to want to travel to the foreign as required by the registry of convictions for crimes.
He must give news to the authorities if he wants to travel to the foreign for more than three days.
It is also required to give the police a seven-day admonition on its planned department date.
The lack of notification to the authority may lead to a sentence of five years of prison.
Kent's police said you wouldn't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter's movements in the country.
A portfolio of Kent's police said, "Kent's police will do all that is necessary to protect children in this country or outside.
"From our view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have adequate complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protection of Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work carefully to monitor the behaviour of the convictions for crimes registered in the country to minimize any possible risk for the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after having spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for being abused of two 10 and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he had to ship a flight for London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not make it passed to passport control and finally took a flight for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not let him enter and return to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he returned to England.
Finally, he flew to the 3th Heathrow terminal on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbrie's presence, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked a person to insert it in the register of convictions for crimes.
Glitter had been captured in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having images of abuse on children.
A source of the Ministry of the Internal Ministry said that Jbúquith, the secretary of the Interno, felt safe and happy that Glitter was stopped by traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the teacher remote from the scene to extract the font" Günther Bauer, photographer
Don't shoot or flight or hire before.
Only the extent of the great teachers of the flamenc, distracted from the concentration that characterizes interpretation, to look at the appearance of the man or woman's relaxed appearance.
Somewhere the artist.
Otherwise, the person.
Two unseparable faces, except in private, in those moments far away from the public, when the intensity of a gesture, the depth of a stealed look or the expression of the hands are natural because they must not go to the scene.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" changes the theatricity of some songs, ballers and chitarrists on the pal with the less known side of these teachers.
With this goal, the photograph offers an original flamenc icongraphy, picking it out of various visual angles.
The demonstration, including the Planning of the Month of the Flamenco Photography, reflects the internal importance of this ball, every day more," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" it can also be common people, but seeing photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, interpreters or executors on the scene.
These people retracted "on the road" are "artists able to send passion, triumph, joy when they are on the scene ... and catch the public.
To collect the personality of these big ones, it is not necessary to take them back to the scene,
Because their personality and character are inside.
What I was interested was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to catch with the photography car the personality of the great flamench."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long way in 1997 to take back songs, chitarrhists or ballers using a photography car.
It is recorded that, due to the type of machine and material, they remember the classic photo.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to a idea that reflects the concept of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that it is and it is able to surprise each day."
Not the baller, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, to win the public with his art.
Searching for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of hearing and being, I have been and have been the continuous of this work, exposed to the El Fotomata gallery in these days.
Famous flamenc artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are in this selection of about seventy retired artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of the flamenc, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exposed to the demonstration.
The passion for the retracts brought Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportART project" "Sports athletes".
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photograph admits "I love to get people back, know them and can walk for a moment in their life, whether this is a long or short time.
I think it's the most difficult type of photography.
You meet or compare with people, persons you sometimes don't know, or they allow you only a few minutes to take the photo.
Besides these circumstances, as a photograph, I always try to concretize my ideas."
The collection of records of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people", is aligned at the gallery El Fotómata, at the 20th route of la Mata, parallel to Alameda de Hercules, and will be opened to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa wakes that the romance that is writing is a "scardo"
It is environed in places that still doesn't know and handle unknown arguments: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is taken with a new project to which he is working, a romance whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is a Irish narrative who has lived for twenty years in Congo and has passed through Amazon.
Since always favorite for the Nobel Price for the Letterature, the writer confessed yesterday in occasion of the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project that is being occupied today "is a blue" and that "all indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If you have a good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it equally and I hope to finish it as before," he concluded his intervention to the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that you have seen through the city of Acquedotto for four days a hundred writers, historians, journalists, and thousands of people.
The figure of "The city y los perros" was, as pronostic, the figure of spick at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of Hay Festival to be the most voted writer of the participants – an ancient edition of the book "Our mutual friend" of Dickens, filled the posts of the theater Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself before a public to whom the peruian was flying the time when, with a wonderful and great memory of humorism, he repeated the literary vocation in him, resulting from the "excellent aventure" of "reading" and "living beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplie the "many of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuing recovery; such as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced their vocation and as "the images of memory" are the foundation on which his accounts get.
The Spanish-American Romanian, he said that " there is no way" to measure and know whether the books can change the life of people, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, a efficiency," he stressed Vargas Llosa, insisting that, in contrast, "the has effects" and "the most anti-conformist people". Therefore he invited the writers to "no cease to the frivolity" and "to assume the ability" of his vocation.
The time prevents the Festival of Pozoblanco, denying it from the runs
The festival of the courses that he had to suggest the days of the Festival of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after the towers selected for the courses had checked that the conditions of the ground of the market were not appropriate.
Therefore, in accordance with Fermin Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Hernandez, the company decided to suspend the celebration of the course.
The enthusiasms took place against this Festival, preventing the feast of two days on three.
Saturday, the rain prevented the execution of the second cycle of wallets.
Cards included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, which had to face a Castillblanco tower.
Thus, the Festival had regular execution only on Friday.
At this occasion, Daniel Luque was trionphing, cutting three ears and brought out in the trionph, after towering with pleasant and estical.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante ended his two courses by seeking health and one ear, granted more from the public than for the course itself.
The worst of all was El Julie, walking through the area of Los Llanos without glory and without pene.
With the second tower, after a tremendous mule, you have gained the fish of greater part of the public.
A car with two thousand kilo hashish over the blocking place in Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
Agencies intimize the height to the two employees of a car instead of stoping the flight.
The agents intimated the height to the two employees of an engine, but instead of stoping, they were given to flee.
Their load, more than two tons hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after they have entered them can arrest one of the two employees, a man of approximately 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the communication of the Department of Internals of the Basque Government.
The arrested endeavour is undergoing drug trafficking and public documentation.
The incident occurred when some of the Alava road officers were carrying out a control of transport on N-1, at the point where this crossed the communal circuit of Armiñon.
They argued to stop a car for inspection when the driver, crossing the lusts, accelerated brushfully and overlooked the blocking place.
The agents have been given up until the vehicle, after a few kilometers, stopped on the road border, and his two employees have fled in a forest area.
The agents of Ertzaintza were therefore able to arrest one of the fugitives and to sequence the 2.178 kg of hashish that were transporting and taking action once they checked the car, a Iveco Daily.
The hashish panels, which were on the back side of the vehicle, were then placed under police guard for a deep investigation and the detection of the weight.
Furthermore, since the officers recognized that the registration was "duplicated" because it did not correspond to that reported in the carrier documentation, the crime of public documentation was also imprisoned.
Ertzaintza continues the investigations to arrest the second suspicious person, who has been able to escape as already said, and to determine the origin of the secure drug.
The 28-year-old prisoner A. A. J. was led to the police station to perform the appropriate procedures and to be available to the judge in the next hours.
Stop Heather Locklear actor for guidance under the pharmacist effect
Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for guidance under the pharmacist effect.
A witness saw it and had risky hands while trying to get out with the car from the parking at Montecito, as revealed in the magazine People from a portfolio of the California road.
The witness indicated that the Locklear was attached at 16.30, "the accelerator was shitting down, making a lot of sound, and trying to get the car out of the parking with brushing hands forward and back. By making backwards, he held more times in front of his eyes from the sun."
Shortly later, the witness, which appears to haven't seen the actor, saw that Locklear was stopped in a nearby road and was out of the vehicle.
It was this person to warn the emergency services, because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actor sitting inside his vehicle, which partly blocked the road.
"It seemed confused," and therefore the agents brought it to a specialist center for drug use and alcohol to submit it to a test.
According to a police portfolio, the actor has shown himself active and the hypothesis of alcohol excesion has been separated from the beginning, even if "as observed by the officers at the first time, we believe Locklear was under the effect of some pharmaceuticals."
Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of guidance under the effect of some not best specified substance and was closed in the local prison around 19:00 to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was recoverable from a specialist clinic in Arına after being recovered after an anxiety and depression episode.
Clamazares stresses the andalusa federalisation of the IU to keep their own activities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator of the UI and member of the Partie Izıda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, has confirmed today that the regional Federation of Training will take a decision on the case of the former assistant to the Youth and the Sport of the Community of Siviglia, Francisco Manuel Silva, who has signed the releases last week after the customer's accusation.
"In these cases they are particularly federalists, and the organization will be adequate to have their own abilities," he said in relation to the resolution that the party must adopt in relation to what has been advised to today in the Sicilian Council.
However, the leader of the UI stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have done. "The UI always wanted this type of investigations to have the maximum transparency."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "treatly strict ethics codes for all public loads".
"Sangre de Mayo", the scom's epica of Garci
Inspiring to Episodios Nacionales of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci replies in Sangre de May the Spanish rehood against the French, which is the most ambitious movie of his film, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the register tried to "Iluminate the torrent of persons and at the same time the social analysis" that has always appealed to the work of the Romanian, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevary, head of a large cast of interprets.
Sangre de Mayo, for more than two and a half hours, debuted this Friday in the cinema sales, to become a television ministrie in the future of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
Great amateur of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci, supports the fact that he had performed with this turning "a dream of his childhood", and he believes that he had to thank Esperanza Aguirre, which had ordered him three years before he turned a memorandum film for the second centurion of 2 May. The record had accepted a covenant that the history of based on the Romans Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unilateral opportunity" to restore the scenarios and customs suitable to recover a "storted Spain who wronged the choice of the leader to fight and the fact that the fight for India brought the people a huge delay in the development under the kingdom of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the register is rammary that he has not received financing equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double than Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to turn some scenes provided by the scenario that he himself had signed together in Horacio Valcarcel, a career of almost all his car.
This, for the record of Volver to begin, affected what is its habitual work practice, the scene with the actors, with which often uses to try before turning together with those who will not be part of the cast, because it considers it "humiliating", considering that "part of the work of the register lives in the theater and the cinema to know what it is doing in the sector where it works."
Many of the interpreters, part of which are in the cast of Sangre de Mayo, are trying before their car, such as Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that no one of the three candidate films to represent Spain at Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de Mayo, Seven tables of French billar and, the last selected Los girasoles blinds - represents the youngest generation of the Spanish cinema "which should be known instead".
From this film, Garci isn't expected to be a premium.
"In the beginning you think you're working for posters, then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and at a certain point you're fitting to rotate a film in more," explains Garci after more than 30 years of car.
Isabel Bayon records the sivilian absence of the ballerin Tortola Valencia
A Siviglian ballerin makes another ballerin like Siviglia.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and mother and andalusa (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in Triana's quarter, and at the age of three, he moved with the family to London.
It was a free dance baller and a specialist in east dance.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of the female emmancipation, of Isadora Duncan calibre, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian, and it was the cause for abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The lives of this woman, who has signed a revolution in the field of dance and eastics in Europe between the two wars, have always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would like to work with Pepa'oa and you suggested me this person. It seemed incredible."
It supports the ballerin: "We are not trying to tell his whole life, but bring them the spirit.
The titles of his dance have suggested me some basic elements of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the maripose" suggested me a guy, or "the dance of the serpent" some tanks.
His dance was sensual and it was told me that my way of balling is also in this esthic," explains.
The scene provides two contributions here: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of its spectacles, as it makes it "The open door" and the teacher Matilde Coral, which, of course, wanted to work with the one who was his teacher.
"Matilde interprets a adult Tortola, the person of matureness.
I'm glad that he accepted to work in my work and I feel very honest about this."
It also includes musical and chitarrist composition such as Jesus Torres and Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the violation of Rafa La Viola and the violation of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "which interprets the role of the eternal accompanying of these artists who have been too tough, and who have always had a lot of spacious."
In the work, the life of this woman is also present in some way, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all Europe, because it was usually in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think it's one of the women who have had an enormous influence in a given history period and now no one remembers it, and so much less thinks its operation as something of value," supports Bayon.
The spectacle will begin today at 20.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theater.
With the publication of the "Diary de a recently married poet" the Trinity is also closed
The presentation of the first edition of the "Diary de un Poeta Recencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, includes the activities scheduled by the Assessorate to the Culture of the Joint of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennio de Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to remember the fifty-year-year-old anniversary of the signature of the Nobel Prize for literature and death of both.
Thus, the "Trien-years of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" is concluded with this operation, with the Interna Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the house-museo of Nobel and with the demonstration it holding "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That chopo de light", which was incurred last May and that, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, it will come to New York together with the Interna Congress.
Moreover, the Assessorate to the Culture of the Joint of Andalusia has bought a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary d'un Poeta Recencasado", in respect of Peter Tabernaro and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to promote the spread of the figure and operation of one of the most highest poetes.
America likes a little little without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is of the actor Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de Malicia" and gives the idea of the imperfection of the American cinema, and of all America, in front of the consequent idea that Newman has gone.
And it cost him very much to get him a Oscar.
And since 2007 he was in pension.
And he also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard thing for everyone.
"It's sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and I now do a big friend," Robert Redford wept, "my life and my country could have been better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exhausted.
A father of the cinema and the country was dead at a particularly dark moment, for fear of terrorists and seamen, with the self-sufficient of the American people to earth, to search for new motivations to feel decent.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain good people to love, they don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all of them, he incarnated the platonic ideal of wrath and truth.
He was an official oppositor of Richard Nixon and defensor of lost and victory causes from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the dead firstborn of overdose to the creation of the march of marriage and biological food.
All gifts to a country to which it has been extremely difficult to go beyond a self-suicide food culture.
The weight of amazing was over Hollywood, without to treat or to passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel ́ig, noticed that a man wasn't dead, he's over a time.
Another English, Sam Mendes, registered with Oscar, said that working with Newman did nothing but the cup of his car.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, ○ Crowe, was deceived to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a high level for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who try to live today as Paul Newman did: maintaining highly the need for justice and having a serious and remote private life from telecamers.
This is not always easy or possible in the median jungle of today.
However, some try us, and Paul Newman has a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who remained faithful, even though he wasn't safely missing the opportunities to not be.
"Why am I going to eat out of the hamburger today, if I have a beach at home?" she solved.
In heaven, he is accompanied by the proud that his daughters are also his amirators, which is not so common in America.
"For all the great roles that he interpreted, no one was so proud as the devoted husband, loving father, not lifted and philantrop," they say.
The imperfect course of a Madridimpica
Yes, the dream of many of us is that the Olimpiade will be in Madrid before or later and, after the trial failed for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of the course of yesterday, I would just say no!
They called her the "perfect course", but I think it was much long the worst he had assisted.
A lot of stupids, that if they had later been taken into account the act of assessment and I would have to examine them, the response would be absolutely negative.
But we're going to go and start from the beginning.
The stupids have started with the throat of the back, which was supposed to go before.
It didn't seem a wrong idea, but if they force you to go, it's to remove everything (including the chip to avoid codes during the garage).
Instead of not.
You had to go just to take the backsheet (from foolishness, go only for this) and (after the relative coad), surprise! they had only magliettes of size 'S' (second stupidness, because I need a XL size).
In what world do we live?
Is it the crisis if they have decided to purchase only small magliettes, made with small weight and so less costuous?
Well, things of this kind are inevitable to the same day of the course.
Besides to go very quickly to take the chip, the waiting cup was 15 minutes and, more, you have to keep the cup.
The expectation is more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a course to which more than 11.000 people are expected.
So, as it was predictable, the course was started that we hadn't even deceived the wheel, though, once we succeeded in the company, the recovery also resulted worse.
Furthermore, the rain of mine waited for more than 40 minutes, which was added to people's rebellion attempts and was stuck at stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have the pulmonate, and some, like me, will not even find out in the correct classification because of the chip that, I guess, has not registered correctly the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect course, this will not be certain of my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream a well-prepared city.
Microsoft search receptor (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emergency technologies, Microsoft presented a new image and human interaction system in preview, a kind of artificial, but without much ability to carry out some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a navigation service to move within the company campus) by assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of shapes and faces, this "receptist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - including to remember their position in the company - and to listen and understand the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group the presents in discussion groups.
In the video for example, the receiptist finds a third person, but it understands that it does not belong to the group with which he is talking and that it is not a part of the company.
Ask her if she's there to visit someone and she says she'll be available to her soon.
Everything without blue.
Impressionant.
But this is, of course, the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week has been very talking about a change in Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that, if the computers were found out of the essential and less dear business spray functions, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for at least.
Any discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version, has continually added to Windows features and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft has the right: the operational system will always lose importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome in the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was the first Google's competition with Windows.
Many just highlight that a browser is not a operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is an essential element to communicate hardware and software.
Do the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your sister.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but it may be necessary to think of the "dead" of the operational system, not as a absolute truth but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always give less attention to the operational system, and always more to the web browser.
You take the computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and every day we have more time by navigating online than in a remote window environment.
What are the half of the applications of the operational system needed?
At least it's more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than View.
Less weighty, less superficial, less complete.
Microsoft is interested in more integrating its online services so that they can make a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and I bring a little example here.
I threw the photo inserted in this post in one of the recreation sites for Microsoft, Redmond, at the beginning of this month.
On the bicycle car, a map encourages them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an Indian study came to the conclusion that the 66% of Microsoft's shops used Google to perform a network search.
Last week, in the rest, the delay was confirmed in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be marketed in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, becomes always more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is punishing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso was carrying her in the Azur Coast, Caprio's placed in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de blood' as well as Al ́Il Padrino of Francis Ford Coppola as part of the typical uniform of the gay muscle park.
And if we try to count the stars' appearances, we can repeat the image of the force with the clipped baffs that lift the weights in the walking circle.
It is, in substance, of the typical man's master, with the inside of cottons, attiled and without manic.
It's the 'tank', as the Anglofons call it, even though the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel picks up between all.
The "Marcel" is exceptional to others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex tackle, for its distinctive set and for the small Belgian flag (as soon as possible), which the most emblemical models of the mathematics of the mathematics are brought as detail on the geo.
The "Marcel" is exceptional to others for the high quality of the coton, for its unisex tackle, for its distinctive set and for the small Belgian flag (as soon as possible), which the most emblematic mallette models bring as detail on the eye.
And attention, because the production of Belgian ditta does not only refer to the "tank".
Comprehenses also boxes for the college, boxer returned, cashmer cardigan, cotton bottles, marinary magliettes, baby-dolls, mini short...
Intimate clothes thought to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as an intimate white.
I'm too good.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry about me."
The great similarity with the sister did not prevent her from developing their personality.
Monica'z is small, but full of life.
Currently, the sisters have taken very seriously their new activity in the field of mode.
For Monica, I'm much more than beautiful girls and celebrities that give their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that Mango's signature has made of his new seat, and the presentation of the most important premiums than the Spanish mode house sponsorizes.
Heavy and horrible, he wins you quickly.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we had thought of my sister Penelope and I for the autumn winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and at the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
We say, a very intense day, but at the same time, emotional.
From what elements are your new collection for Mango at this fourth work season for the Spanish house?
My sister and I like the movie of the 50s is 60s, we get a number of inspirations from here.
Then, I love in the city and watch how to clothe women, how they combine and mix their clothes. I often do it.
Ballerin, actor and stylist, you're a very versative woman, right?
I think yes, even if everything ends, and there are many elements in common.
By little, I loved the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to feed in my tante's arms and see her vessels.
It was a bomb, it's better even to go to the game park.
Then, once the ballerin, I always gave much attention to the clothes.
It is known that the ballers really like to have their own style to go to lesson and wise, to look at the speech and feel well.
And in the role of actor, when they show you the watchtoba is the time you really meet the person.
So, everything goes together, yes, with very respect for stylists and professionalities.
Not long ago, you've been 30 years old, you've been in crisis?
But no.
You never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I think women at that age are mature and have a good experience to realize life by making less errors.
The biological hour doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted for a little while, and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're gonna be a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know I'll be a mother because I'm asking my own body and I want to be a young mother, that I don't want to.
As the candidate, I don't care too much.
What I will do will give my son great happiness and educate him with love.
As regards the film, you're expecting to scan in different salts some films around last year.
That's right, and I want them to scan.
As a woman coming from the theater, I'm very disappointed and anxious, I'd like everything right now and clearly, but it can't always be so.
I want to go "The last hour" and "Search for Christ's Tube".
Let's see if you'll like it.
A few days ago, you've been debutting on the cartridge with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not that you're in the past like a model.
Simplely Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, invited me to go to London to participate in a favorable slider for his organization "Dane for a better world" and the habits we have made – I brought two parts of our collection for Mango - they were put to the stage to collect funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this side of Naomi.
They say so many things about you, that I, who know her from a long time, can confirm you that I am not so true.
In addition, I am with this good part in which you are coin.
He asked me to screw for a noble cause, but if he asked me to make the pig, I would have done it at the same time.
If it's for women in the third world, you can't get back.
Residuous alcoholism drivers will have to install the "alcohol"
The Ministry of Interior requires that the drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive rate of alcohol in the blood install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in the state of furniture or if it is not used in the apho device.
The implementation has been announced last and is already included in the annual report of the General Court of State, according to which it will be a pilot project for a year.
The objective of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In this initiative, besides the General Straight Safety Procedure, they will participate in the Directorate-General of Trade (DGT) and the Technological Institution Fund for Car Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of cars reported more than once in the state of ebrity return to the car.
Alcohol would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the respirated air and prevents the car to be moved if the driver doesn't sofy, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than that.
The cost is greater than 1000 euros and would be charged by the sanctate.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that the vehicles of those devices are allowed to reduce up to 65% of the crimes committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is calculated that it could save life of 115 people per year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: putting on these behaviors before making criminal crimes.
And to facilitate their development, since the legal reform can be implemented by means of a legal way, and, without doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require a organic law.
However, the device is not yet on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even though it has already been introduced in experimental way in some industrial and public vehicles.
Tomorrow the Congress of the Members will vote on a initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system in school bus, as it has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British puntuality at 17.40, second programme, Spanish aircraft in which the principles of the Asturies traveled at the presidentialhangar at the Benito Juárez of Mexico Airport.
The sun was crossing, but the races were still forced to use the hand as a vision to see the real couple descending from the air.
At the feet of the list, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
Sometimes before I asked a taxist, for the street, if he knew that the Spanish principles were to visit the city to formalize a official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that moment... you're from here or...
- No, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a few years.
- Oh, very good...
Mexican pressure, however, knows very well who are the principles of the Asturies and the importance of the travel.
Many are those waiting at the hangar of the airport cast to the red tappet and military cordon composed of 27 marine soldiers who offer honor.
The prince seems smileful, dressed in blue sea, and you, the princess, calling the wind, very sorry, not using her habits "peep-toes", may have mentioned that in Mexico City he threatened bad time.
They give to photographs a smile and a short suit before they go to the room where the official committee is waiting for them.
By the door of the hotel in which alloggians, one of the four largest in the city, expect them a spiritual reporter of the Mexican TV.
The best premium offered by mode
There is probably no place in the world the most appropriate to present a mode prize, which is not Paris and probably not a more busy and good living stylist of Valentino.
Mango has presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to promote the internal promotion of new talents in the mode field.
It offers a $300,000 premium.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in Mango's vector at the number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost weeped from emotion.
On the other hand, it is the second shipping of the depth for size in Europe and it has been opened with 1.335 square metres.
The first is in London.
So many events, united with the desire to please the stylist Valentino who had presided the concurrence's jury, had started with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier of Paris.
With the nearest chagal telecommunications, the Chagal presidential table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Birth, with the inflammated heart and doing need virtue, because of the recent death of the brother, he brought an apartment of the House and some completions of ELAH to remove the fiat and arm of the son of Luis - a boy of almost two metres height - accompanyed Valentino to the presidency of the honey dinner.
Andik, the owner and Mr. Mango, did the honors of house and horse, which he's finished, together with Barone Roøjil, without a bed, because both had fallen to two ladies.
Monica ́z, who managed the store in bottles and bags – designed by her hand – transformed for the dinner, carrying a long black-sensual boat and emotionated during the nightly companioned by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the room for the ballet wise and she, remembering other times, took a bar and broke a "ground plague".
Inés Sastre didn't stop for the places of the palace, but she had shown us the photos of her son on the cell.
The next day, we were pleased with the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy who moves in the moto - and John Tra′, who was coming to Paris's Intercontinental Hotel, with his lensules, his chickens, and was assured in precaution that there were no hooks in his room.
Stars below the star of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and one way to forget the caotic and frenetic daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring relax in the library on 30 September.
Awake is almost a chastisement when it swallows every morning at 7, but it is still worse to imagine to be involved in the frenetic rythm detailed by modern life.
The office is called tension and the bad back computer.
Stress is the bad of the 20th century.
However, there are not one and two methods to fight daily sugar and difficulty to get out of the world of work.
No, this number has nothing more and nothing less than 100.
Outside of the yoga, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in its book pages, all a "menu" of options on measurement for pleasure and time for each.
The anti-stress operation is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach libraries thanks to the editor of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that it is impossible to win peace in the areas such as the workshop or in personal relations, this "manual" denys that conviction.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as to be in contact with nature, or has 100% of naturals that contribute to relax.
If adrenaline doesn't go in your venes to find the body balance and stress has become a problem, it's the time to sit on the divan, spread the mind and focus on reading.
Talk in the dream
Some children speak during the night.
I don't refer to those who wake up very intensely to tell us something that happened to them on the day, but to those kids who speak still sleeping.
The first time it comes, it takes a fear, but it doesn't really have much importance.
It is a good change in the definited dream.
It is manifested with certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, most of you have reported that you were talking in the sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporative way (one time in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with a more regularity (all day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember any more.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
These are episodes related to other slaughter disorders such as the in·, the night fears, the night enuresis (doing it to bed), or the sonnambulism, but not necessarily.
As already accented in prespectiveness, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress or surroundings.
In any case, it's still a little studied phenomena.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet voice ton, with solved words, almost in a shout or that occurs the opposite (scream, cry, long talks ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be necessary to observe the child and, eventually, consult a specialist to check if there are some issues that are generating anxiety as I'm looking at the situation.
We said that this is a good change, therefore, there is no treatment unless it is associated with other slaughter disorders that can be treated (e.g. if it is packed with anxiety or stress situation).
However, what can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to eat the kid too much before he goes to sleep.
Provide quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arise fearful or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is fatal to relax, relaxing techniques can be used to gain a certain internal calm.
This will allow the child to sleep quietly.
Once the dreams seem to try to keep it quiet.
Remember that they are inappropriate for the child and that the day after will not remember anything of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
It's unusual, because he's not aware of what he's doing, and you'll break his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's relaxing.
Remember that if you appear very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency, it is better consult a doctor or check out where such a big anxiety is in the child.
If you understand what it says (that is not the most common situation), do not fall in trying to make him a questionnaire to get information.
You won't get anything, because it's sleeping, and so it's not conscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he dreams to say it, so you need to give much attention to the interpretation of information and the conclusions that these can bring to.
Never tell the kid that you could ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Don't even get too crazy.
Something like this causes a big anxiety.
Soon, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
The island... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found the way of the victory home after a long intrusive period.
Without a horrible game, the Yellow-ners have created the largest number of network opportunities by transforming one into the game's victory.
The time was not very supported during this meeting when the attackers were expressed in fatigue.
After a first temptation of the Captain of Guest Kauffmann, who split the seven with a remote tire, Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other caused the Dannemary, Funderflick from far, then high Hirn, Romanin, and even Diebold.
The Dannemarie answered with a block in the center of the field, leaving only the Riahi scatened in an attack point.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial opportunities signed Riahi and Temporary for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais network for Illhaeusern, well placed, rejected a ball on a first temptation of Diebold (53').
But Illhaeusern's cannoneer will not be able to realize his long happiness and will be released a dozen minutes after leaveing his square companions in numeric lowerness.
But the Danemarie will not be able to use it and will not put great problems on the eleven of the Illhaeusern, which is uninterpreted to "forthe strengthening" the sea, except in the last few minutes of the day when, after a Rocambolesc action, the ball was disturbing the cross.
Sarkozy meet fishers in the cold
Before I go to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a tape in Britain.
In the first place of the demonstration of fishermen who brutally prevented access to various Britain and Normand Ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the Gate of Guilvinec, in the Department of Finistère, to encourage the representatives.
They promised to collect it "with building spirit" and hope that "they are present with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that is currently at the same time with the General Assembly of the "Christ Committee" created by the British fishermen in order to adopt measures to address the impennate gas price, which has reached its record with an average of EUR 1,14 per litre.
According to the portfolio of Eliseo David Martinon, the president will "debat with them about possible solutions for companies to recover and ensure the conditions of work and refund of the marine."
The fishermen waited for Nicolas Sarkozy to swim.
On Wednesday morning, they conducted "Lumaca transactions" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of inorgus.
The port of Quiberon has also been locked, but the links with the island Belle have not been interrupted.
On Quiberon's penis a road block has been executed.
Monday, the marines have already proved their determination by burning, from the white, pneumatics and palettes in front of the debtors of fuel at Brest and Lorient gates, while taking feet of manifestations in Concarneau and Saint-Brie.
The movement was extended to the ports of the Atlantic Coast and Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendea, where the fishermen remained in the molo, or in Havre, where a twenty-year of them prevented the movement of trade vessels.
Fisheries of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Atlantic Loira, interrupted the block of the raffinary note of Donges at night.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer, they decided to wait for the meeting that will be held on Thursday in the ministry to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "Christ Committee" will decide on Tuesday the future movement action and the possible participation in the meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the fisheries committee, which has not supported the movement.
"The fishermen will continue" because "the fishermen will not cease" and "they do not intend to move to Paris", he announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Committee on Fisheries in Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who are not paying taxes on gasoline, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but they estimate that the rental limit of a ship is reached only with a gasoline less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable interpretation of "Butch Cassidy" was dead by cancer, at the age of 83, in his house of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have welcomed the film's legend and actor committed by Paul Newman, killed at the age of 83.

AIG would over 15% of its activities
The American International Group insurance company, repeated by the American Monetary Authorities, would cease more than 15% of its activities in order to recompense the acquisition of $85 billion, according to the Sunday Financial Times edition.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of large part of its activities, as well as the cessation of insurance branches on life on the internal market and the United States, specifying the newspaper on the basis of more than authors.

Paris: Cronistoria Morning Meeting
The New York Borsa held a historical cross on Monday, after the Representative Room expressed against the Paulson plan for the salvation of financial inhibitations: Dow Jones has 6,98%, or a calamity ever seen, drawing close to the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10.365,45, below 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst of losses in his history (684,81 points) above that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Borse after the terrorist attents of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the main technology titles, has 199,61 points closed at 1.983,73 and the expanded standard & Poor's 500 has 8.81% (a.k. 106,85 points) closed to 1.106,55, standing to the final closure numbers.
Demoralized at the start of sitting, Wall Street is deep after the unexpected refusal of the bank saving plan, thought to return stability to the sea.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 votes in favour, the representatives rejected the funds required by the Minister of Tresor Henry Paulson.
About two republicians on three have rejected the plan.
"It is a negative signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress incapable of adopting a plan," Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial, said.
"All this indicates how much the market was on the project," he added, fearing that in some days it might be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was actually dead... then the witness would pass fast to the Fed – Federal Reserve - (the Central American, ndr) and other central banks to resume the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions," he warned Brian Bethune, the financial sector and → at the Global Insight.
And still highlighting the state of emergency," every day that goes through brings to the cross of a financial institution" in the United States, Pigza highlighted.
After the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the acquisition of Wachovia's activity by the Citygroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis was brushedly accelerating, encouraging the emergency intervention for the United Kingdom banks, Benelux, Island and Germany, marking that the sea are "not only in front of a American crisis, but in a world crisis", added the FTN Financial analyst.
The committee market has grown strongly.
The revenue of the Boons of the Treasury with 10 years was to 3.632%, against 3.827% on Friday evening, while the end of 30 years is 4.161%, against 4.357% of the day.
Obama in advantage to the first television dual
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, there is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without surprise, the general quarters of the Republican and Democratic campaign have announced the respective victory of the television dual, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although worthless, was not enough to allow him to breathe in the investigations at five weeks from the presidency.
The Gallup Institute, of which a weekly published opinion survey grants a benefit of five points in Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), shows that the democratic had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on a campaign of unexpected electors, found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% point on McCain.
A great performance by his Joe Biden list companion, expected during the first and unique debate with Sarah Palin Rival, should confirm the benefit of Obama.
"Subvaluing it would be a mistake.
But he has a good intuition," he warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventeenth McCain has never ceased to promote his inadmissible experience in the field of foreign policy, highlighting the "inhumanity" of the opposer on the issues discussed during the first face to face.
"The Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." he often told many repeatedly.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills necessary to become a president."
What since yesterday has made a continuous distinction for the Republican TV campaign.
Obama, on its side, stressed how his choice would represent a new future.
Without extending, it has been concised and precise.
He promoted its pre-disposition to the right decisions and the intention to restore the picture of the United States on the world scene.
"McCain has never understood, in contrast to Obama," he said, this week-end, a democratic spot, reproving the Republic that he did not take the measures necessary to face the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
In the nineteen minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, said Obama yesterday before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a rain, for a electoral meeting.
He has not even spoken the words "medium class" or "workers". The financial crisis goes for Obama, considered the Americans as the most appropriate person to save the person on the corner of the precept.
"The next week could represent a decisive sight," he considered yesterday the influenced democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton Administration, compared Obama's intention in economic matters to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the crollo_ is "the final verded after eight years of economic pessimistic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Regarding the intention of reducing rates for 95% of the Americans despite Wall Street's susceptibilities, the Senator of I°nois also mentioned between its priorities the achievement of a potential energetical indices of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energy and the action of a sanity insurance system.
McCain, on his side, would build a 45 nuclear centre park by 2030.
The two candidates have made the requests focused on the financial safeguard plan of $700 billion (470 billion euros) adopted last night the Congress and extremely popular.
In Minsk, "Do you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opioors showed on Sunday evening on the main market of the Belarus capital to predict the results of the legislation.
Some hundreds of Belaruses gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of electoral seats in the Central Place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of legislation.
While the results were still expected, many young people came to manifest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, releases".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "To what? They will do what they want from my voice," says a boy.
They do not believe that the scheme which has made it represents forward to the external observators in order to take place in dialogue with the European Union is ready to introduce a democratic disaster.
The sanctions, including the visibility of 40 Belarus leaders and the congelation of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legal from observers.
They weren't, according to opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the vote breakdown," Jouri Potemkine, a portfolio of the Union of Democracy Forces, complained.
"It is a change in the face," stressed Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of opposition to the presidency of 2006, and the head of the pro-European movement, as it is important who counts the sheets and in this case it is the executive.
If the opposition members come to Parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not chosen.
But their income in Parliament can be a television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition has therefore the need to enter into the policy because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our , which is worthlessly in debt with Russia, comes into crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we are able to become a Russian protector.
Now we want to be inside you."
The opposite is that the ‘European Security and Cooperation Organization, which has followed the electoral process, is the validity of the investigation.
It underlines that the quotas of participation seem too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of the electors in Minsk) has given the way to every type of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? asks the social-democracy leader Alexander Kozouline, one of the two recent political prisoners that were released this year in August.
There was no one at the electoral seats.
And there will be at least five members of the opposition to Parliament, the most convenient to the power."
The night silence falls on October's road.
In television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee are being successful.
Meeting - The blood is safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Dr. FrancineD.A., had all the reasons to rejoice because Hema-Quebec became one of the blood providers of the most safe and effective world.
In particular, he recovered the confidence of the public, seriously exhausted from the infection blood scandal between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, blood reservations managed by the Canadian Croce Ross Transfusion Service have been infected by the immunodeficience virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In front of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public investigation, directed by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at lighting the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and spread recommendations to prevent the reproof of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever continued to stipulate a report, some provinces claimed a committee with the aim of ideating a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was held and held by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the reports Gélineau et Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to provide the Quebec and the Canadian Società du blood for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started his own activities, 38% of the people declared that they still have confidence in the donations system in Quebec, remember Dr.ssa Decary.
The situation was mortal.
Thanks to the continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood reliefs and research on the field during the following years, we have recovered the public's confidence," it explains proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population had great confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Decary is convinced that "the confidence is something extremely fragile".
By its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec applied the principle of caution.
At the time, it was assisted in Europe in many cases of the human variant of the foolish muck, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's mob, reporting that it is at the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know absolutely if that disease could be transmitted through infection blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, that when there are doubts and may be a serious illness, in this case the creutzfeldt-Jakob morning, which is manifested with a degeneration of the brain that leads inevitably to death, are adopted exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than one month in the United Kingdom has been rejected since 1980.
Now, a few years ago, it has been demonstrated that without doubt this disease has been transmitted through infected blood.
This episode showed us that it had the meaning of applying the principle of care."
In 1999, there was a much more higher technology on the market for HIV development: nuclear acid tests (TAN) that allow directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not the antibodies against it, which were based on the tests used until then.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, or since the person has contracted the disease to that where the first virus can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, the specialist explains.
That period could be reduced to a duration less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not able to identify them is so significantly decreased.
improvements have allowed significantly to reduce the risk of contrary to AIDS with blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million is risking to receive blood infected by HIV virus.
"In other words, that means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood campaigns before someone is infected by HIV virus.
As Hema-Quebec distributes between the 400 000 and the 500 000 blood campaigns each year, there will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with transfusion.
I think we can feel quiet today when we receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health, state the head of the Hema-Quebec direction.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain our products' security.
You never know what patogen will occur in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Reunion, which, like the Nilo O'ale virus, is translated into the blood by an insect.
It must be constantly watched," Doc.ssa Decary continues before pointing out that Hema-Quebec has to provide it with sufficientness, as well as with safe resources.
"The needs increase because the population is old.
As treatments against the most aggressive cancer, patients often need to provide red blood or platelets.
The age of the population has also consequences on the number of donors that in average only 3% of Quebec's residents are acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who have 18 years of age and respond to the criteria of admissibility can give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
In the meantime, 14% of the people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted because they have aid or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled into a country where this last is spread, they will be rejected for a period equal to a year.
"With this 3% we could keep an inventary to respond to the needs of hospitals.
The cases of pain are very rare.
However, the members of this group of donors must be renewed when they are older and cannot make any donations anymore.
Now it is hard to convince people to give blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today life is so frenetic that it is difficult for a hour to give blood," says desolated Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec distributes not only blood campaigns but also human weights, of which bones, eye-global heart walls and skins are used almost exclusively for severe usions.
There are an analysis, transformation and congelation of the weapons before being taken by the Hema-Quebec, which manages the only public of the ombelical blood in Quebec.
In the ombelical cordon, which once was considered a biomedicic discovery, enough blood of staminal cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leucemia.
"We have celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion in our thousands of cordon blood campaigns and we are planning to take more than thousands every year.
It should be started to propose for trapants at the beginning of the next year," says Dr. Decary, which describes this practice of pregnancy of cordon blood as a very popular.
"Too many moms are deceived that you can't have access," because Hema-Quebec does not have the means necessary to offer this complete and costous program in all Quebec hospitals.
Calcio - The Semifinal Effect
The Montréal Impact was qualified for the semifinal of the A series eliminators, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive game of the final quarters at the Stadio Saputo.
The center campaign Antonio Ribeiro, signed the decisive goal at the 90th.
After a first time without goal from both sides, David Texto and Rocco Pla have signed the following networks for Montreal.
For Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Remember that at the first party of the India-Return, Friday, the Impact had soon been a 2-1 disastrous at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle's area.
The impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in half-final.
Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thundler took a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to face Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed today.
Shortly - Decisive Networks of Kovalev
Canadian and his axes are ready to restart the season.
The three formats by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, yesterday night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, signed a goal, made two matches, and collected a victory in the quarter of the Haven Games Preparatory Games.
Decisive for the victory the only Kovalev signed network.
"I'm not still ready," he warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel my deal."
"He has tried to defeat in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a ovation."
Charest points north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the initiation of elections before the end of the year.
The General Council of the Liberal Party concluded that Jean Charest was held yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc, (to the left), tried to be chosen in occasion of partial elections of today.
"Uplying the borders of our last large north border": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, which was submitted to Levis yesterday by means of instruments from the strong visual impact, in occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
After him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mulino to images".
On three maximums, they were confused with negative spectaculars of hydroelectric digs, mineral cultures, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means like in full electoral campaign.
In addition to the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the initiation of the autonomous elections, even if he noted that he was very committed.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on handwork, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often nominated in the latest talks of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - has never been subject to a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explain why the North would be "a joy of the potential potential," but he did not speak about tempests or investment quotas, as he did not explain the precise priorities in the implementation of future projects.
Moreover, it has been limited to report what is deserving a priority position in its opinion: hydroeletity, forests, but especially the mineral sector, which has experienced various improvements since the growth of the coming countries and the restructuring of public infrastructures.
In the list styled by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, ram, platin, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamants".
This great territory is the double of France," it's here, the Quebec.
It's not only here, but it's insighted in us," he insisted, as he wants to highlight a myth of founder na.
The Quebec's race is rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the golden febrer in Abitibi, the engineriana, the Baia of James.
"Speak to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatre pause to look at the large map at his shoes.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always renounced, explained the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position maintained by all governments.
There is a line of borders on which there has not been any agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity is present, I will repeat that position in the name of the government," he pointed out.
The rest," considering the climate changes, it is necessary to re-evaluate the North," he stated by speaking of the north-western west, which will be opened for the whole year because of the isolation of glace.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister estimates that occupation of the territory is a duty.”
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about it and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of the young.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-member of the PQ of Hungava), have already been given the way to consult a thirty community.
A interministerial committee presided by Benoight Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) is a major charge, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting," not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "common visions" will be provided.
The development of the North would reach the remaining principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with the first liberal ministers who have predicted it.
"So as the liberals who have provided us, we know distinguishing ourselves to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was of altronde one of the topics of the end of the week, which began on Wednesday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to restore the Central Beauharnois in Diga Adelard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, the creator of the Hydro-Quebec, in Lesage who nationalized the hydroeletity, in Bourassa, the Creator of Baia James, our party has always learned to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
The press conference has been sent to another reference, conservator this time, the "Street to North" program of John Diefenbaker, first minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project on Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric digit, Charest pointed out that its function would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we'll do it," he confessed to his soldiers, rising up appealing.
In fact, the Prime Minister, which said in April, would not have been elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not discard the possibility of launching an autonomous investigation, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It underlines that it is certainly very committed, especially in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
At the end of the week, the General Council provided the liberal chapter a platform of resolutions, in particular the "aspirations" which have passed slowly like oil: the PLQ claims, in particular, the "Quebec Specification" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec names of members of the Council of Radio Diffusion and Canadian Telecommunications and that these will have the right to vote on decisions taken in Quebec.
As regards opposition, the abbosion of the North Plan has been accepted in scetically.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, replied the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Government of Landry in 2001.
It states that the liberal government, reached by the power in 2003, would not respect the application.
If he had done it," we would have been progressed today," Marois commented on the candidate of Jean-Talon (screet today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated to support the adoption of the North Plan by the Government.
"What we're going to do is that all this doesn't be felt like a spectacle," commented Sebastien Proulx, leader of Mario Dumont, in return today from the holidays.
Letter - A disonored country
It was Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" of Harper's office, to allow you to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "small" for Canada.
In this way, dishonoring a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our appreciation is saying much about the surrounding of the Prime Minister or Stephen Harper.
This is the first thing to a government that is the only one, among all western countries involved, to have not replaced a citizen detained in the concentration field of Guantanamo.
A government that does not take account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of imputing facts.
The only government who, despite signing the Geneva Convention, rejects his word and lets a soldier-sold child fall in unhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the responsibility of the accused.
Remember, in the light of the information, that the Amnesty International et the Order of Canadian lawyers, in particular, calls on Omar Khadraffin's replacement, whereas it may be subject to a regular process in Canada.
It is exactly the same government that closes the eyes in front of torture: it is very little important that a young adult be psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of surprise.
It is not yet aware of it, but we are assisting an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", says that Harper does not stop obstinating and that it sounds so insensate on his lips.
Here we arrive at the moment when there is no more morality: it can be maltrated, tortured, arbitraryly captured a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a ruler until today (to see what will be after 14 October...).
Many electors believe that a party that preachs the Virtue, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has rejected what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
It's just here the shame, Mr. Toews, in the renounce of all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The orwellian talk of Barrick Gold
In the edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, president of the Canadian Minerary Company Barrick Gold.
Following a orwellian logic, this last states that the biggest aurifer company in the world has sported a challenge of six million against three authors and a small squattrinated editor house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the Jews are indigenous and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a query for distraction, but the law.
Without surprise, this substantive difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way of conducting a public debate would lead to the round whoever is able to support an opposite position to his own.
The outcome of the process, the writers and the editor of the Canadian Negro book will have to spent a total of money to organize their own arms and fight against an exercise of lawyers financed by the taxes of the Minerary Company.
Moreover, in these weapons fighting, the tactic is often the destruction of the agreement in order to introduce a regulation, the fact that the opposition was to him, as well as to fear anyone who is going to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it was first to the public opinion that she should have presented its view of facts.
In contrast to what Barrick Gold works in many countries in Canada, the debates are in line with the exchange of opinions and not with mangane.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, documents, and to establish a real and own debate through journals, media, publications and financing of indigenous researchers who could be able to light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in public opinions and denied badly the requests and letters supported by the authors of Black Canada.
Maybe Garver might explain how he can ask for a "public debate" when his disappointment for the same public is clear?
In the world of the president, it seems that this word indicates exclusively the promptly paid lawyers and not the whole of the Canadians; here is a very close vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What the Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and the editors of the Negro Canada do it first because he refuses the brutal means adopted by the mineral company.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of citizens' exchange of opinions, and not in the opticity of what many feel like a kind of invasion (seeing the "public debate", the Barrick Gold has given to the authors of Canada Nero a ultimatum encouraging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Besides Garver's surreal talk, the sporting queel from Barrack Gold has a direct attack on university research freedom and the employment of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It refuses to block the right to quote sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis for intellectual work.
If in a country such as Canada it is impossible to study and discuss the issues of the world's most unusual enterprises, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do it by following scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
He has the right to repeat.
For a long time, the university environment, in which we are part, is able to handle debates and disagreements and re-conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, in contrast to its claims, it does not investigate a transparent debate.
This goes out of the university world, as the same public debate in Canada is, and it is now that governments take measures that can limit abusivity.
Operation - Saving for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
Bush's administration and the Congress's heads, representatives of the Republican and Democratic Division, have finally been joined to an agreement on the largest safe-financial plan after the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion US dollars, which aims to put a freneal to the financial crisis that has been severe for months on Wall Street, must still be made by the two Congress rooms.
It provides, in particular, checks on its effectiveness by the electoral leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the refund of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses pigmented for payments, as well as an inspection right on payments payed to the directors of protected undertakings.
The American Secretary at the Tesoro, Henry Paulson, the president of the Room of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative republish at the board of the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a maraton of two-day negotiations.
"We have made great progress in order to make an effective agreement on the sea," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"Each decision has been taken in such a way to protect the American and the people from the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the democratic.
"It's the crucial point: if we had not acted in this way, inestimable disappointments and troubles would turn back to the Americans' daily life," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns regarding the impact of a new failure on investors.
This morning, the time-limited corresponded to the opening of the sea.
After the negotiation, the two candidates to the American presidential were very favorable to the agreement, however, without avoiding expressing their miscontent before the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the Agreement, in particular that will allow the owners to keep their home and the inherent refunds to the heads of undertakings covered by the State.
"When the contributors are asked to take exceptional measures because of the inresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice in.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote for the plan, his republical adversary, John McCain, said, "I would like to examine the details, but I hope so."
"When I've read, it's something we all have to ride and that'll let us go forward."
The option of a non-intervention is not acceptable," he said.
The plan of 700 billion aims to recover with the money of the contributors of the double credits, the risk- and inventory assets of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outcome of an immobiliary ball that first led to the risk-hypotechnological credit cross (mutui) , then extended to other forms of more exposed credit credits (PCAAA) and washing the liquidity and banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of republics in charge to send the first project of an agreement last week.
It seems to have been out of that blind vicle since the democrats accepted that the "toxic" activity of some difficult companies is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet all of them at the Congress, it was added a provision that, if the government had to face losses during the five years to come on account of this programme, it could make new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first amount of 250 billion, which will be able to add to 100 billion if the President thinks necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be made by a further vote of the Congress.
In turn, Washington will receive quotas of participation in protected enterprises that will acquire dividends in the case of profit and that will be able to renew when the waters will be calm.
As set out by the plan, the Federal Government will have the opportunity to recover the penalty procedures relating to immobiliary loans and to set limits to the remuneration and departure payable to the directors of the enterprises involved.
Since today, the plan's members would like to submit to the vote of the House of Representatives and to the vote of the Senate Thursday.
Despite all efforts, it is still not sure that the way is given to their plan is free.
In fact, there have been several votes in contrast to the project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democratic district.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," he said to his electors, the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Room Financial Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But it's not sure to use contributors.
Leader of a small group at the Congress, called "the Caucus of Sceticis", the Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation in different ways, but joins the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of ↓, including three Nobel Prices, have written us to say: we ask the Congress not to bring out disturbed conclusions and to examine the way to take carefully," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, it was once again to test the world nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of Fortis Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the Governments of the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French BNS Paris reported that it would reject the acquisition of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) for the risk-risic immobilial loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 and is part of the twenty largest banks in Europe and ten largest insurance.
"It's not of money," he declared yesterday the Dutch Minister for Finance, Wo ́Bos.
On the contrary, the principle and voting right are recovered in the issues of the European Parliament.
It's certainly something that sparers and families appreciate now that time is announced uncertain."
In this period, at the other end of Manica, the British Government seems to make a new billion for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the Government would carry out all the loans currently currently in the Bradford and Bringley, over 41 billion dollars (75.5 billion dollars).
Spanish Santander has made known yesterday that you will buy the contributions and the client accounts of the British.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second, after Northern Rock, to take up a nationalization process by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
The wrath of the blue eyes was for a long time his ass in the hand, for others his weak point.
Did he release himself from the narcissian speech, the American actor from the amazing smile?
Yeah and not.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful sanctified to true and their sacred monsters.
What a constant thing!
Paul Newman, disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, in his gang of Connecticut, after a lung cancer, remains one of the last American cinema icons of the long-term years.
Less monumental of Brando, which he looked like, and of which he was longer rival on the eye, more fragile in his own, certainly more fragile, but he also carries the freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mystery couples often born magic children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 by German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots, one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble, last quality mark.
Since there was in him all an invasive country of the safe made man, the fighter of the war of the fifish, fierce in the fight, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic art in Yale, later attended New York's Actor before he trionphed to theater, in television and soon to the cinema.
The same military man for civil rights was also the car pilot who classified himself according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, and sex symbol, although part of a couple models since 1958 with actor Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of a reserved, discrete, imprisoned, allergic to the show-business scandals, which will never be able to wake up the mystery completely.
A honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart tuff for cinefils, while his big persons people the black of memories.
In addition to a half centuries of American films in full transformation, it is repeated through its interpretations.
They are confused in memory the cow-boy fancy of Butch Cassidy(1969) and that boy incapable of wanting the focused wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat on the coat that fitted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Recently, we remember it in Mr. Briı (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep as promised.
Many other Paul Newman have passed to the story.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Lassú, somebody loves me, of Robert Wise, a role in James Dean and repeated after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That worrying sympathy in the great Stangata, Oscar as the best film in 1973.
Love and Vendicative Billiard player in Lo Spaccone, a great movie of Robert Rossen (1961), Martin Scorsese's money color, which was worth him in 1987 the only oscar of 9 nominations.
That face throughout the years was his.
He's still.
The times are happening through his way.
Young people know it especially for the Slap Shot- Colp movie culture of George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, a hockey square on a little orthodox grid.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop of the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a last role by the father of the Irish mafia in Era my father, in 2003.
In contrast with the most legends of the film that quickly left the job, Newman will stay long in the sales, accusing Hollywood in all his effort, festivals and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French cinemator, defined it, with a point of ironia, "a living challenge to underplaying", judged overwhelming his performance.
Profession has not always been a good Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall as manna from heaven.
However, he often prefered the role of the emarginate to the young actor: neurotic persons, alcoholized carrying or distressed, of which he expressed asking and rebelling with his perfect conduct.
As recorded, Newman revealed an unknown defence of his true, pudding sensitivity.
The first time Jennifer, in 1968 (based on Canadian romance Margaret Laurence), with the wife of Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, traced a subtil female retirement of the melanconia.
He, who had the son of Scott for a overdose, dedicated him to the Harry and Son film in 1984, discrete and sad film.
Among the innumerable omages that weared on Newman yesterday, his big friend and old arms partner Robert Redford (they were recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said infinitely triumph" His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the disappeared actor.
Outside of a legendary car, it is so a great military for civil rights, ecology, Indian cinema, a contemporary of Hollywoodian derivative.
We have cut off his face on acetic bottles, salts, bishops and other foods, giving it a bad choice of pleasure, even though he was born as gag.
However, the income of those sold were to his Children's Fund for Difficulties.
Newman, instead of adapting to his myth, chooses to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that he said "Always and until the end, your father was unbelievable to his good star.
It was a privilege."
And the same privilege was for us to follow the way of an American artist so generous and generous.
The model citizens therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the factory factory of Zuschlag & soci?
In short, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against Janos Zuschlag and partners will be discussed.
The political man and his partners are committed by trade fraud repeated in the context of a criminal association that has caused noteworthy damage, and other crimes, including documentation.
According to the Office, the money obtained by competition bands was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the implementation of activities through factures.
The State and municipal money, totally 65 million flowers, has been completed in part in the cases of the Fiatal Baloldal Organization, in part in the taxes of some people.
According to the method, known by the applicant authorities, they have taken the money obtained from competition bands based on facts for non-existent operations and associations have never fulfilled the obligations taken.
According to the act, large part of the factures was.
In order to make it, the factural blocks were purchased on the market of Jozsefváros, but the circles were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to determine on behalf of what he said to issue the factures, he was established between the gita between the hills over the Balaton where Janos Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of this last, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for consumption, on the model of these, the facts were prepared to submit to concurrence bands, among others, to those of the Minister for Youth and Sport, the Minister for Work and Social Affairs and the Budapest Community.
Most of these are the works of István Lados and Andràsi, which, according to our information, has set up the relations needed to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' trip was a beer.
According to two factors issued by Zuschlag and societies in 2003, the restaurant place made foods for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egyesuelet Association.
But so many people, as the restaurant states, would not all enter together in the local.
Similarly, the facture and Property in 2002 to the Jobb Jövièret Foundation, later called Együtt in Harmadik Evezredert, bullet of formal errors and contents.
A pension of Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people couldn't overcome us, however, 130 guests in the fabric.
But the compilers of full of fantasy factors have exhausted when the Pigal Kft reported, also this is a restaurant, in which accountability - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - did not even include documents on behalf of Jobb Jövért and Hoppa.
Gy\ź Farkas, the manager of the company, said to hvg.hu that when he was called in search and showed the facts, he immediately understood that it was documents.
"The name of the Iva game of our business was in a wrong point."
He added: Besides the formal reasons, he didn't even return the fact that, according to the facture, hundreds of people were rejoiced when they totally have 11 rooms and there are not so many places of bed.
In addition, the facture was of restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in operation.
The compilers of factors have not been worried about informing themselves that Budapest’s travel agency by their choice, organizing only travels to the outside, so they have stupidly indicated the facturation in county travels in Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of the company's emissions.
Moreover, as shown during the investigation, Iva also included the facture, while the travel activity to countries outside the European Union is excluded from Iva.
In addition, Iva's amount was wrong on the four documents em. by the Hotel Revfüłp Kft. for the Jobb Jöv­ert Foundation, because on the services offered by the company Iva must apply to 15% and not 25% as indicated on the facts, and the hotel's ́s ́s ́s only printed facts, while the fabric was written in hand.
Furthermore, the "senders" destroyed other facts, in the case of a dictator, indicated that the transport of goods on the road, as it is known by the Procure procedure, activities which were not affected by the company based originally for advice of investment.
Furthermore, for formal Property - causes unconformity format, timbro - has been discovered that the factures issued for Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány, from XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are ́e.
The same occurred in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camp of Kunfeherto, whose representatives refused to have issued the facts concerned.
The financers did not even take attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület feeded you, for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the dictator, according to our information, refused to have issued that facture.
They issued factures consciously
Another group of fabric issuers is held by those who were conscious of having to issue fabrics.
The Esély Budapestert Alapitvány foundation issued a facture on request of Fiatal Baloldal -ifjú Szocialisták for the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Evezredert of almost 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the charged, according to the act, convinced the director of Collab Kft to issue fittition factures.
In 2003, the Biogate Kft was also in liquidation with Zuschlag and partners, which provided a value of approximately 5 million flowers to the Jobb Jövért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület Association and the Preösfeny Association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even the moving of money because the prepared factures were then scattered, but the associations forgot to make this aspect figure in their documents.
In the following group of issuers of fabrics belong to those who are connectable to the employees.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorised to receive the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft, with a seat in Budapest but not repeated there, which cares about fuel trade and vehicles.
In October, November and December 2005, the dictator issued several facts on the sale of computers, for a value of approximately 18 million flowers.
According to the investigation data, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas has purchased these facts since 14 September 2005.
The Director-General of this Dictionary was a Romanian in which Ivan Kubatov would transfer the documents on the dictatorship between 2002 and 2005.
As we know Kubatov, during the investigation, he has set out factures in the name of the company at Atlasz, Hoppá and Egypt in Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány and the contro-value was taken by him.
On the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian murders have founded Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, however, none of the dictators was operating because they had not received jobs according to the tax.
However, firms have become useful to him because, on request of the lawyer Zsolt Sente, the editor of the funding documents of the companies, on behalf of the dictators, facts have been issued to associations related to Zuschlag: at Atlasz and Y-generation.
On behalf of the Company Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has issued 15 entities for a total value of 14,2 million flowers.
The investigation believes that Kubatov has taught 10% of the amounts indicated on facts and Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fitting factors made for the Biztos Pont concurrence band.
Y-generation and Šövetség at Modern Magyarorzhágért in January 2006 presented a band for the public utility entity of the Socialist Party, Ta ́sics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They also wined 500,000 flowers at test but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the band.
In order that this would not come to the gala, they presented to the TMA five fitting factors received by Works Team Kft.
These facts have been found during the surquisition of the office of Ár ́d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
A part of the employees, as they have already been in search, will probably refer to the development of the production of factors.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the inputed number one, Janos Zuschlag, would decide to raise the vial on everything.
His confession has not been very detailed until now, and even though he has promised to speak more times in an extensive manner, he has not yet done it.
It is necessary to see if it is in its interest, may also be that socialists have taken agreements with Zusi, which would be willing to make the expensive goat in exchange of a refund of 50 million flowers, a large part of the damage.
It could also be disappointed because its claims to attach his conditions of prison, namely the concession of home arrests, have not yet been heard.
While the authors of non-requisibility and caused damage can freely or at least wait at home for the end of the procedure against them, which is not granted to him.
Psychology of the claim too much: why do you spent more money?
The buyers are intended to spend more, to overevaluate the goods.
Neurologists and economy researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this known and apparently irrative behaviour.
According to their study appeared in Science magazine, men don't want to stay back in a garage such as eBay's wedding, so they are able to pay a higher price.
The research tried to track the nervous scheme of this "partition" at the level of the nervous system through experimental asses.
A group of volunteers has been lodged, the other group of volunteers has participated in a stage while with the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) have examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games, the participants could win money, but in the ass, where the substantive element is to claim more than the other, the body covered under the brain cortex is intensely functioning when it loses.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, is a role in the "auto-gratification mechanism" of the nervous system.
So, according to researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the vital reaction of the steady body.
In order to support their theory, the research group's economys have conducted an investigation of financial income.
In this investigation, three groups have invited a partner in different conditions.
The control group referred to the real value of the product concerned, and they did their point.
To another group other than that they have promised that in the case of winning they will receive another premium of $15.
However, the third group would have received 15 dollars before the debt, but the members of the group would have the money in case of loss to the dead.
The difference between the two groups consisted of the fact that for one of them the win was highlighted, and for the other the loss.
By checking the neurological hypothesis, the members of the group who had "confronted loss" were willing to make higher points of the control group or "victory".
"These results are not deductive from any of the existing economic theories.
In fact, these had even explained the phenomenon to the axles with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to restore the contradiction between the two theories, so that we are joined to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of Economy in New York.
Hepatitis: When should you contact your doctor?
Nearly half billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but in Hungary, among the first causes of death, chronic hepatic diseases are reduced.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis diseases exceeds a hundred miles, of which only 7000 are cured: the reason is that many sick people do not know that they are contaminated.
Hepatitis definition is the collective name of hepatic diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typicals are hepatitis and irritation, but their patogenic agents and caused diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms according to the patogen agent: Hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other virus with blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal losses, saliva).
For those who travel are useful to vaccinate against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two-three weeks after consumption of infected foods, associated with general disorder, weakness, dozen pain and nausea.
Following the shape of bullets on the skin and on the white eye, the fats become clear and the dark urine, the cure occurs within two-three weeks.
A million people die every year throughout the world for hepatitis B, the most serious variance of the disease, which causes lever tumors and hepatic cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one person of ten receives a pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not healed, hepatic surgery and liver tumors may cause.
Most of the infected people don't know that they have treated the disease because patogene agents are undergoing the hepatic cells in a way, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
So it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical analysis.
This disease is much more frequent than the media in three groups: who had a blood transfusion before 1991, toxicity and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected by the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since a routine examination also reveals the illness is worth contacting the family doctor when any unknown symptom of origin is not known.
In time recognized disease is healable, the virus can be removed from'em, thus stops infective power and can be prevented from tumor formation.
The 30 September is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 throughout the world by disease associations.
The goal is to call attention on the chronic hepatitis, the causes of its development and early illness.
Who believes in God feels less painful?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith works as an analgetic species that made the death of Catholic martyrs more sustainable.
The scientists of the University of Oxford have and have made an interesting experience, considering how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In the context of some bizarre investigation, a electroshock of 12 Catholic believers and similar atees has been performed, while all who observed a representative painting of the virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject great part of pain.
Thanks to the explosive technology of human brain, the Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain of pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which, beyond the academics, scientists, philosophy and theologists of the University are also involved.
The test was performed exactly as this: a tool that emits downloads and pass the electroshock has been connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to concentrate on two paintings, the virgin Mary painted in the 16th century from Sassoferrato and the Lame with the vinci's armelline painted in the XVth century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the virgin Mary originated a sort of religious state among the believers, while the framework was chosen because it was not too different from the other and they thought it was quietly.
The subjects of the experience have spent half hour before the MRI scanner and in this time array they have received 20 electroshock in four consecutive series, while they observed or painted on religious or other subjects.
The Catholics mentioned that the vision of the virgin Mary made them feel "secure", as if "one would care" of them and "they were quiet and pervasive of peace."
By looking at the image to religious theme, they have taken into account 12% less pain than when they had the work of their faces.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part of himself in the test, thinks that a similar result can be achieved with any strong effect even for the atees, but it needs to find the appropriate image.
"D we need to look for a picture to which they nut very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright enjoyed the result of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." Wright added.
After the best results, the question remains only if the painting of a madonna of the believers or another calibror pitcher is presented to the believers, what could have effect on the control of the pain?
The vision of a virgin Mary of quality would bring better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the day of the tenth anniversary, Google can say to be both in the people's boxes and in the sky above their heads; he knows where they have passed the vacation, which ambulance they attend and what they care about.
However, this, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the dictators, is not enough yet.
Instead, what happens to the scettics that make a comparison with the orwellian incub, they do not see exactly the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect more personal data than its users, and this is necessary to reach the original goal of the Google founders that was: "We insert all the information in a system!".
According to the Google Director interviewed the dictate, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still in the beginning to manage all information.
At the question, what will happen within five years, Schmidt answered: He would like if Google could answer questions such as "what I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job suitable for me?", but the software couldn't answer to simple questions because they don't know enough of users.
Not all inhabitants know that during their Internet research, the search words are exactly recorded, from which India IP are searched and on which page the interested ones are stopped after search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users such as can memorize their navigation history, they can relate to what they searched and clicked, and then they will generate results in a very better measure; on this same logic, it is based on recommendations with which the system provides products and services based on our declared and registered preferences.
What if my data are used against me, if they look at what I'm busy? - the worrying users of Google data monopolie ask.
In most cases, the antireactions of the internal people are caused by the fear of the potential powers represented by the dictator, and not by the sense of the sense, for the fear of punishment, for the desire of freedom or even for the rebellion to power.
One fact is, however, confirmed, that all the searched expressions are not only registered but, in motivated cases, may also be provided to thirds, in such legal cases, where the personal rights of the interlocutors are nothing.
The most suspicious example of this in recent times may have been the coordinated action against Brazil pedophiles, in which Google has transferred to Brazilian government information that has made possible to identify pedophiles from the Google Orkut page.
Instead, those concerned about personal rights have been suspicious of highlighting to May when the dictators agreed with the EFF EFF legal protection association - have successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: it can not be charged by Google with no point of deduction to provide any requested information secretly from the FBI.
(In the same time, the Federal Government succeeded by almost 500,000 web and thousand research expressions obtained in respect of the confirmation of the law of infantile protection approved years ago, but it was not able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and key words that appear at two months.)
Thus, Google's judgement is very contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data sfer Google because they believe that their intimate spher and private life will be attacked by using their services, and they arise with the spectacular rebellion to the multinaes that slip for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of appeals, activists and users of the computer appeared in many countries see in them the future generation of the big dites, the "cool corporation", contrary to their rival, the Microsoft liquidated as a conqueror of the world because of Windows, for both they fight for the same purpose.
This can happen because Google does not ask his users for a identifier code, does not ask for money for your services, the source code always updated and the program package is much more accessible, young and cool of the official practice of the software collection.
But it can also happen because geexs see exactly the problem relationship between personal rights and the Internet, which really involves one of the key words often repeated in the last years, the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 does not speak of other than of the screening, intensively leave tracks behind us and use communication channels to us and while the size of them changes for each individual, the substance is the same: showing us ourselves.
A medium young man can create profiles in more community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical pleasures, all of them can include them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, also write blogs on which its most recent photo gallerys appear automatically stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
In the meantime, we read many examples from which the girl, seeing the series of photos taken by the morning from the common round of friends, comes to know easily with who has passed the night with her dead boy or a dictator can release her deeper because she has written a sincere opinion on the company's top: one thing is safe, the concept of private life now has been completely recalled.
Who lives a online life makes us show ourselves and so we can formulate the tess that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
But whoever wants to hide something or wants only to avoid Google monopolie can do it (e.g. starting with Scroogle using Google searching system but that at the same time does not leave voluntary tracks).
There are no few people who do not register about community pages to be found, Google online applications, from the processing of texts to image management and news collection, you can find alternative versions that are not linked to large server parks and which do not compose our best profile yet existing.
The public opinion expects not so much in secret the time when Google will get out of the arts.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars values more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), advertising spaces AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of the public agencies, the services introduced at record time cause great malicians not only to Microsoft but also to many software development digits.
However, the critical observers that are all of this find warning points: for example, the company's top has completely refused the protest of the demands after doubled the right of the company asylum, has considered too costful the repeated restaurant to enjoy the daily day of the divisions, but all this reduces the fact that in 2006 Google has made the chief to the Chinese government and, in the meaning of their agreement, it will filter all the results that disappoint the good pleasure and interests of the Chinese regime.
A internal rule of the dictation seems to be not to publish a new service in the past but only when it is used, one thing is sure that the future months and years' problems will remove the world in one point: while some believe that the project of scannering and transmission of books and magazines of Google will provide proportions that the dictator will soon be before the Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, because in this we can create a health profile with our references, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic based data can offer good material to the next generation of fantastic writers, the Scroogled report of the Holy Cory Doctorow describes the future with orwellians, in which a man with Google data can be closed in a warning way.
Two minors helped Ozd's duplicate killing to lose tracks.
The police asked two minors about the duplicate murder of Ozd, suspicioned fundamentally that he had helped to lose the crime tracks - stated on Tuesday the Police Question of Borsod region.
Young people have committed the crime to their imputed, currently they are favored.
The two minors, two girls, according to MTI's information, are free.
The benefit is penalty until 5 years of recruitment.
The suspect of the duplicate murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old man of the place, was put in prevention.
It's suspected of a pre-meditated multinomia made for profit.
From the investigation, the 20-year-old young man had a big debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspicious didn't want to deal the debt, for that reason last Thursday, he took his creditor into a song of Ozd where he and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was prepared to commit crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon at the place.
The police is investigating the weapons and circumstances of use with the involvement of a expert.
The Borsa of Varsavia offered a offer for the acquisition of the Borsa of Prague
The Borsa Values of Varsavia offered 200 million euros, approximately 5 billion Czech crowns, for 100% of the list of actions of the Borsa Values of Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Borsa of Varsavia, confirmed the advanced offer by the Polands, despite the Czechs had excluded the Varsavia Borsa as a possible acquisitor of the Prague Borsa.
The reason for exclusion is that the Borsa of Varsavia is owned by the state.
The 99% of the actions are in hand in the Poland state that intends to sell about a few months more than 60% of its titles.
The Czech financial day E15 states that the offer of Poland represents the highest number for the Prague Borsa.
According to the Czech press until now, they have offered a offer by the Vienna Borsa, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Borsa, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Borsa and the German Borsa.
Petr Koblic, director of the Borsa Values of Prague, stated last week that among all the interested parties, the Varsavia Borsa would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Borse in the future.
Market experts appreciate the value of the Prague Borsa in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the Actionary Agreement, almost 90% of the titles would be sold.
The largest owner of the Borsa de Praga is Patria Finance with a percentage of almost 25%, followed by the Cheská Sporitelna Bank with 14,7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5%
The economic crisis from the view of the European Journals
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the internal economic crisis are already talking about "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the American president - > The Republic - that it has not been able to compact its party behind a quickly broken law, which is the purpose of remediating to a disastrous situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the superfinancer Warren Buffett said, would be more precise to talk about a second 11 September.
A part of Madrid's pressure also sees the explosive cab in Washington.
According to El World, the lack of American political guide has cast the world into the worm of the barter.
It always grows the danger of the crowd of the American financial system, and that will later suffer the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the conference's vote, there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means for the management of the crisis.
The world is suspended in air, just when the largest transformation of the capitalism history is being carried out.
It is no longer possible to release the threat - accentuate the Days-Indegger of Geneva.
Some states still can offer a safe-scale to barcollant financial institutions and with the money of the contributors can save them from the failure.
But if any more banks cross as in a dominant effect, they will not be enough or the financial means or new immediate solutions.
At a long time, Member States of the European Union need to overcome their selfishness and control over the seas of deteriorated financial marine.
Only Monday, the debolised financial institutions have received more than 100 billion euros - remembers the Der Standard wines, which seems to be more real than the European contributors, like the Americans, will have to put their wallet to the crisis.
The EU has not so much worryed about the crisis that has passed through the old continent as a tsunami.
"Salvators" should not slow up the 100 billion euros immediately, but it would be better if they determined in which case the money of contributors should be touched to prevent bigger damage.
The smart car imitates the flight of the calabron
What could be the best method to develop anti-collection technology if you don't imitate the sensors of obstacles that are in nature?
For example, those of the eggs.
In the exciting project presented to CEATEC in Japan, the calabrons have given the initial strategy of Nissan engineers how to build the next generation of anti-collection systems.
In relation to the University of Tokio la Nissan built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a prospected robotized minimum of the apps properties, in order to create a system that can scan all the sessions.
Flighting the apes form a own oval personal space that really looks very like our protective sculpture - explained Kazuhiro Two, director of the PR and research and development sector.
Important is the role of the ape view, a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers have reached the laser idea to copy the function of the app view.
The BR23C finds obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the board micro-screen that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid the discharge.
In a fraction of according to the robot it feels the stomach and then, imitating the moves of the app, immediately changes direction by rotating the wheels of the measure to avoid the incident.
This manufacture of avoidance, in a way different from the system, is conducted in the way of all instinct.
"If it wasn't so the robot car would not be able to respond quickly to avoid the sessions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory Mobility and the robot project.
It must be reacted in the instinct and immediate way because this technology corresponds to the damageable and more internal strategy of the protective sculpture, within which the invention is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what one is doing to avoid the other apps.
This process must take place in an eyeman.
But in contrast to the eggs, the deviation cannot go up or down or in diagonal, it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of the wheels.
Instead of the infinite opportunities available to scan the other apps, the robot, as possible, can turn on himself, accelerate and slowly.
BR23C is feeded by bacteria to lithium polymers, reader and higher energy density, which means that their duration is greater than those of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, it is important that the ability of intelligent reaction, not the processing of data, or even less the ability to store them.
This robot must develop some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on manual data, so it uses only a few decimal Kb memory.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for immediate avoidance of the seats that, as provided for in Nissan, can be installed on series vehicles within 10 years.
An additional possibility of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that prevents obstacles on the road leading to destination.
They also found the name of the child most costly
The written version of the economic salvation law was amended by 700 billion dollars for the acquisition of the proper credits, to apply in more parts.
In the first time, half of the sum is spent.
In the new processed agreements until midnight of the Sabbath, according to the time of the east coast, the leaders of the Congress decided the 700 billion dollars saving plan after a debat that was last days - the King refers.
We have compounded the series of advances - stated Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American Representative Chamber, which only remained to put the agreement on the paper.
Both candidates at the presidentship, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the commitment of the plan.
The Minister of Tesoro Henry Paulson, talking about the result of the commitment, said: the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian sea at the 8th hour of Washington (the 2th Monday night according to the hour of Central Europe), but it did not bring a large growth of the boss.
Monday, the Room of Representatives will vote for the first time in the 2008 Economic Stabilisation Law on the Programme, and then will address the Senate.
President George W. Bush talked to Pelosi on Saturday evening, then accepted the news of the agreement in the White House with joy.
We are satisfied with the progress reached tonight, and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial seas and defend it -- Tony Fratto has declared the Portfolio of the White House.
The programme, however, is different from the original proposal of Bush, which provides that the 700 billion dollars would all have been expenditured for the acquisition of licences with adequate credit.
Now as the first one, it will be possible to expenditure the half of the $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday Congress, with them the Minister of the Treasury will buy tickets with adequate credits, and the rest of $100 billion will be determined by the President.
A special college will control the programme in which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The cost of the other half of 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
In accordance with the law, the Ministry of the Treasury may apply a combinated tactic: it can purchase credits, hypothics and titles at the same time with hypothics and other types of "afvalented credits".
The acquisition may occur through such and directly - have announced the minister's competent authorities.
The legal standard makes it possible for interested persons to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means that concern, for which companies will pay a suitable price for possible damage.
Henrz Paulson said: The law provides the means necessary to make $700 billion for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which are the accommodation of wrong financial means, or their assurance, or to avoid the risk of the crowd of a large financial institution.
We will make all necessary to find us ready to introduce the signed law - he added.
The directors of the banks in crises and in expectation of the State think instead that the government will limit their success, defined by the oltreocean slang, as gold paracadute.
The limitations of payment will only take place in some cases, and the limitations also depend on how the Ministry of the Treasury will offer it.
The limitation means that if the Ministry purchases in the field of a staff, it will put a surface on the gold paracadute if they will not send the decade director to pension.
At the time of direct purchase of credits, the Government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the funds of directors are not exhausted.
This should be added that existing contracts of the golden paracadute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new people to enhance the participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of entry into force of a legal restriction on the remuneration of the general administrators - the Democracy Barney Frank President of the Committee on Financial Services of the Chamber of Representatives has commented on the implementation.
In addition, the state has the right to adapt to a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of contributors, since they can also win us if and with it the saved bank will remain in their feet.
The legislative proposal includes that in the next five years the Chairman must submit to the Congress a proposal that provides how to return the expected losses from the financial sector to the contributors.
Of course, both parties have been those who have expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens asked us, not to defend the dollars of the contributors - said the Republican Member of the California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the arrangements have been taken by the same ones that are in Wall Street's crowd.

Barack Obama and John McCain, candidates to the presidency of the two large American partys, have guaranteed their support to the Governing Plan on Sunday, 700 billion dollars for the salvation of banks, but there are politicians who claim the demissions of the Minister of the Treasury.
The representatives of the Congress and the Administration after the long-term Marathon negotiations per day have announced on Sunday night that they have concluded a principle agreement on the plan of safeguarding of banks.

Printing in the German language world
The right pool is intaked, only within the pool the electors have become more conscious - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Baviera.
The Haider party is ready to rule Austria to prevent red-near coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the edition of the German left magazine, in the article The Revolution of Baviera feeds his parents analyzes the causes of the disturbed CSU dramatic.
According to the famous politologist, the erosion of the CSU has been started very much before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber was loaded.
Christians-social have remoderned the Baviera for decades and now these modern citizens are away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all the Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merker.
The disappointment was not a great surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was done exactly ten years ago: the inexcusable egemonia of a State party has ended.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was precipiented at 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% surface since the '50s.
This has been repeated three years ago at Bundestag's elections in 2005 still during the period of so many men Stoiber.
This is the cause of modernization in the region, which feeds parents.
Sociologists have pronounced it 40 years ago, but have been very wrong for the time, but the secularization, the results of education, the insidiation of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the electors to the CSU.
Modernisation is equal to the increase of opportunities and the political consequences are evident.
The right pool is intaked, only within the pool the electors have become more conscious, critical, obtained.
It is also amazing that in the last weeks, the classic Burguese groups have been removed from the CSU: free professionals, artigians, diplomates and laureats.
The support to the CSU has fallen under 40%.
The press (depresse.com)
The Venice Conservator Day "Who with Who?" in the article "The Presidents of the Parties are blocked in coalition issues" is concerned with the confusion of the Austrian internal political situation created after elections.
The SPÖ intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal business.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the green still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been made, now turns around to the coalition; in the debate after the television public the leaders of the parties have made a view of the maps.
Werner Faymann President of the SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to discuss the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that there is already a possibility for the two parties, in some regions and in social partnership.
Faymann has opened the question if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the president of ÖVP, as a cancer.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repeat of this direction is not considered.
Molterer has reacted to the red offers.
As he said, the operation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to enter the Internal Affairs of the ÖVP.
If its party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition, it is still one thing open in the party, the issues shall be discussed in any case within the OUVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ repeatedly opened in all directions.
"To prevent red-near coalition, we are ready to deal with our ability to rule," said Haider.
Yaróka: It is necessary to break the visual circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summary for Equal opportunities, organized this year by France with the European Union's Round Presidency.
Livia Yaróka, Mr Fidesz of the European Popular Party, in the message addressed to the full as a major rapporteur of the Conference, called attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation of the children of Rome and, in turn, the most serious statement of their claim.
Xavier Bertrand Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidlae for employment, social and equal opportunities have opened the conference at the maximum level.
Among the invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of the largest European civil and rights organizations within the same opportunities.
Jaróka, according to the press office of the Fidesz Group, reminded, in addition to discrimination in the assumptions, that the romes are extremely from the work market first because of their low schooling.
"The majority of youth roms have no medium-level study title and as a result of the elementary teaching of bad quality only a number of young romes can reach a higher study title."
Jaróka also emphasised, as human rights, the key role of education in enforcement of human rights.
Investment in children's education can mean strengthening the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Membership, there is a need to make the most wide range of these links between the romes and the non-romes.
In fact, as far as the school begins a room, it grows more opportunities to become a productive member of the labour market; through the taxes payed for income and consumption contribute to the national budget.
"The European citizenship's right must guarantee their right to quality education and elimination of low-level and segregated schools" has underlined Livia Yaróka.
According to the Member State, the EU's objective and action union is needed to accelerate the processes of disclosure of schools, and therefore it is important that the right respect of existing and designed antidiscrimination directives is appropriate.
"The visual circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, it must be given to the children of Rom the opportunities given by the democratic space so that they may contribute as citizens full-titled in the future of Europe," asked Yaróka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal opportunities" to ensure for all, the objective of the European Summary for Equal opportunities organized each year, from Berlin's meeting last year, is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of antidiscrimination and equal opportunities set at national and European level.
CSU: Mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, you will decide the sort of Huber-Beckstein.
Despite the bad electoral disappearance, the heads have not yet fallen, at the tops of the Bavarian CSU has now been renewed the discussion of personal issues.
The President of the Party Erwin Huber and the Regional Governor Günther Beckstein are still at its own place, the question is until the time of mercy endures.
Of the sort of tendem that has suffered a loss of votes of 17%, it will decide the extraordinary conference of the party at the last week of October.
The two very criticized politicians have noticed in any case that they are not attracted with all forces to the chair.
They so tried to worry about the enraged writings of the Parliamentary Group and the basis that one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" they claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under Edmund Stoiber's guide, then at the climb of his car, the Christian-social Union obtained 60.7%, and now after the state against Stoiber, they descended to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Baviera, which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, the conservators always count in the southern region of importance for Hungarian, in the future will be forced to coalise.
The first sign of the reorganization within the party, the President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, as considered as possible in Huber's heritage, has a place in the stretched exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Liberia Electors who exhibit right values for a possible governmental coalition in Monaco of Baviera.
For a strange surface of the destination in the list of Liberian Electors, the Gabriel Pauli legislation, whose attitude against Stoiber was used as an opportunity of hit by the couple Huber-Beckstein to then treat the woman without regard to the great ambitions.
The CSU leaders now concentrate all their own forces to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
In the meantime, the former regional and former president of the CSU defined the worst day of its political car on 28 September.
Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, which would have deserved greater support by the brother party.
Other CSU policies have interpreted the disappointment as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be cancelled after the elections of the Bundestag set for September 2009 if the CSU has played a decisive role in the victory in 2005.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the disappointment for the floor, the land loss of the CSU will not affect negatively the big coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly related: it will not be easy to manage the vulnerable CSU, but the crisis of the social democrats is still hard.
The SPD has reached its lowest result since 1946 in Baviera with 18,6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
Neither a representative of the opposition has entered the Belarus Parliament after the elections of Sunday.
According to Russian observators, it is the sign of the welfare and stability in the country guided by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe (OSCE), but it is explained with the brochures made in the counterparty of votes.
The OECD, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has no elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million of residents is not opposed for more than one decade, before the elections of yesterday the opposition collected under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the amendment to the elections of 2006 which were held in discussions, "conceived" a few seats in the Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS so rejected an evaluated preliminary booking.
After the expectations of the opposition, Belarus, even more economically from Russia, who requested a credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gases, and allowed the Russians to give gases in possession of Beltransgaz through the country to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other higher rango politicians cannot enter into the Belarus political situation which was considered antidemocracy.
It refers to a distance that the OSCE, evaluating the electoral campaign, has placed an accent on positive movements and not on the lack, such as the third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's quick Monday report also criticized the campaign, during which the candidates of the current opposition were not able to appear on the print, and in particular that the opposition could not be presented to the votes.
Despite this opposition, a political improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also disputed to a small comparison with Mosca, continueing to refuse the existence of the South-Osesia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which the Belarus forms a federal state, considers the two countries indigenous for a month ago.
We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started - has declared to our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the opposition of elections in 2006, it is expected to remain despite "the power had feared to make a single opposition to a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not predict protest actions for the results but try to bring the electors to the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course, we have many problems, d we have to print the newspapers of opposition in Russia, for the distribution of local authorities are difficult, but I also see that more people are always supporting the change, even among the elders - Milinkevich said that not even the officially helped city, the pensioners, considers appropriate the regime of Lukashenko that considers its main result the creation of social security.
Because of the debt of the country and the growth of the economic deficit, it is only a question of time that the disgregation of social security "which remembers the sepulchral silence", says Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition policy, the Russian observers have judged the elections democratically.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community of the States India has declared to the Russian press agency RIA News: "The men believe not in words but in facts," so the lack of opposition is not other than the evidence of the matureness of the Belarus electors.
Brunetta: "From then evening before work"
Never happened in the history of the Palace Chigi that there were round doors for the entrance and output of the guards.
But since today, he takes this new measure against the furbets, against those who are crazy, and then he's going to drink a coffee at the bar at worktime.
The news was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council's President Mauro Masi.
"The round doors," says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services" means the Minister.
"Now a new season of diligence and transparency is opened.
This is reformism," Brunetta still stresses.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the Palace of the Council's Presidency.
For Masi "the choice of round doors is also important from symbolic viewpoint".
There were no resistences from the workers, ensuring the Secretary-General: "It was a process divided by the workers and all was the dealing."
I mean, no more dinner at worktime; no more coffee and coffee.
The word of Brunetta, which suggests, laughing, "a good cappu at the 7th morning is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Superior School of Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister then notes that "in three months the disappointments for public diseases have been reduced by 50%, which means more than 600,000 people in the work in a year".
And adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more
Italian, "which salarial dynamics - explains the Minister - in the last 8-10 years have been doubled with the private sector and well above the inflation rates."
In the meantime, thousands of public holdings agreed to comply with the rules of Brunetta decree by joining the resource supported by Codacons.
"Mit the Minister of Public Function, today the numbers about the smaller absentism to work because of illness - writes consumers' association - the people of 'operous fannullons' are continued to grow.
In fact, there are thousands of people in Italy who are the right and productive public administration who have joined themselves to declare war to the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will be concerned with the exclusion of additional economic treatments for diseases due to service; the extension of the time staff's recovery, in which control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Incidences of work, Napolitan: " crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur on work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white dead were approximately ↓00.
Numbers that testify the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost the double of the deaths in respect of murderers.
In order to call on the attention of inhibitations, social forces and means of information on this dramatic issue today, Anmil celebrates the 58th day in Italy for the victims of accidents on the work, which was held in the second Sunday of October.
"The concernful data exposed by Anmil and the same chronic tragic of these days confirms how crucial the question of the prevention of work," says the President of the Republic of George Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the mutilated and invalid work, Peter Mercanda.
The head of the State expresses its "life appreciation for the continuous associative commitment for the prevention of workplaces, the protection of unfortunate workers, the assistance of victims' families and the public opinion".
"It has, of course, brought up an indignated 'success', sincerely divided, before tragedies that, for their size, create the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality represents us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamic."
Napolitan does not hide that " there is no doubt also a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
In particular, many school-promoted initiatives are assumed for a more direct consciousness by young people in the world of work.
It is necessary to maintain a vital attention to the phononomic, not to deteriorate on its social severity, to apply and improve legislational rules.
On its side, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini underlined "as the phenomenon of the white dead is a absolute social emergence, which disturbs the conscience of each of us and makes all inhabitations a decision to put urgently end."
"The data on accidents on the work seem to signal a light movement, but this does not take the number of white dead yet to be impressive," noted the President of Anmil Peter Mercanda.
"We wouldn't want this "return to the top" to be translated in less attention, because it's exactly when the attention is delighted that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at general level it is still too little to contrary the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our judgment, Mercande's highlighted - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school."
"Besides a further effort - he added - as regards the communication and the employment of the public opinion.
But, especially, the workers have a greater sense of diligence against a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercande's then stated "the progressive deterioration of insolvency lives for the victims of work" and "the assistanceal deficiency to which the system is spent in the last years".
"The objective, therefore, is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the sort of unfortunate persons should not depend on spontaneousness or once-time dealing with the legislator."
Readers Mp3 subsequently risk the hearing
Listen to high-volume music for a prolonged period using mobile musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause continuous lesions of hearing.
This is how the European Commission refers to the opinion of the Science Committee on the Science and Recently identified (Csrseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - you read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portal musical devices every week for more than one hour a day holding the high volume device risks a permanent loss of audience."
"I'm concerned about the fact that such a large number of young people who usually use mobile musical devices and high accurate cell phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in unreparable way," Meglena Kuneva says.
"From scientific records - continues Ue - there is a clear risk and d we must respond quickly.
What is more important, d we need to make consumers and provide these information on public domination.
D We also need to review the existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and maintain the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Index Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the great use of mobile musical devices and the increase of the number of young people exposed to the voice of origin.
"The scientists - concluded the executive Ue - confirming that there is a reason for concern, and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and the interested parties what measures can be taken in order to better protect children and adolescents from the voice exposure from a mobile musical and adequate equipment."
Currently, there is a European security standard that limits to 100 dB the level of sounding of mobile musical equipment, but it increases concerns about auditive damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sound sources.
These damage can be limited very much by providing solutions such as reduction of lives and the duration of exposure to sound.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue notes that the users of mobile musical equipment if they listen to a high volume (more than 89 decibel) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the currently in force limits relating to the maximum sound on the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of audience after a period of 5 years.
This would be about 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, Germany gives the way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today, it begins, in March it is closed, the sums will be taken away.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the works of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which was inside this morning in his new seat behind the Termes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission components will set up the guidelines for Rome.
Once they are closed in March, the Joint and the Communal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official disease" of the Campidoglio and its officer Gianni German.
"The Commission is absolutely indispensable and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - it is to underline Germany - it will have to provide proposals for a view of the development of Rome, of which political decisions, remaining the Joint and the Communal Council, will then be able to be used.
There is no overopposition of roles but only the will to have a place where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, his work will be completed and then will be solved, because this experience must have a precise time term.
A ́ announce the officer - we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of Rome Capitale."
To whom the Commission is inutile, since its opinions will not be binding, the German replies: "All depends on the work that will be able to make the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am safe in Rome, its contribution will be valuable.
The policy is too often disturbed on the management of the day and on the events that are once in time.
In contrast, we want to look longer and farther, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for Rome's development and his future."
Furthermore, the officer of Rome has to puntualize that "This Commission is not an unusual entity or a carrozone: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best entities expressed by the Capitale".
For Germans, "they must have a strategic, not closed or immobile reference design to allow our city to make a level-scale, which he absolutely needed, thinking with a single spirit in his future."
A future that, precisely the office of Rome, "not will be limited to the current communal borders but will look beyond" not only in the opticity of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capitale but also in view of the role that Rome can and must be held as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first anti-American President.
He wrote a famous American politician who has to pass through India: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions designed the United States and had relations (as it does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
They increase the attacks against Obama just while the date of elections is near.
A lady of Miami wrote on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great toast face: he thinks he will win the highest burden of a nation that had in both governments and five black senators!"
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are clearly attacked of racial nature and they do not answer the question of the electors: will be a good president? But there are polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good distance.
In this case, there are some who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper of Mississippi, in the South Vishers of the United States, wrote a editor: once in the cabin to vote, we know who will vote to the American patriote.
It is outside one side of the American mentality held covered up to the last.
"Tell what you want, then we'll think where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if you have to win Obama, we'll go out of America.
That's never stated before now, which seems almost sure the success of the black candidate.
Nevertheless, despite all these reasons, the democracy weapon winning is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: What errors did Bush make during his mandate? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to the seat.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have made life, and the Americans have not been forced to make the valies.
And, Iraq for most people was the weakest point of Bush.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Use, the economic disorder also feels about journalists: in the newspapers it's time of tissue. And many damage the internet, "a" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been interplyed by ↓W Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control in the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimists on their future.
However, newsmen have not openly declared to feel less worried about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is the money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastated economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the chains made in newsroom, in the room where the editors work to set the newsgroom together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that, according to the interviewed journalists, should be resolved if you don't want the tradition of journalism as the large public intends to consider it essentially.
A clear but complete pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
You are on ten newspapermen and executive elders are convinced that the journalist at level is following a wrong way.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest editorial houses are opening a box towards the Internet, for many views such as the "beep" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn is increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are covering technology in the hope that "they do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest spack today in the American journalism is among those who lead newsrooms - that is, directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of the executives at a level is sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage decreases to 23%.
For some, it has to do this with the "security of work".
Executives who think of work within 3 years are at 47% at level.
For the reporters' staff is going to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (and our editors, ndr) in America is always at the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a great nation such as Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet, the employees often offer what they want and become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave it.
Directors receive almost always big salaries, while the editor can also win $10,000 per month, as well as pensions and insurance payments.
For the feasts, then, the reasoning is complicated: every day after the first year, even after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, for their approval, are often "ambulated" during the year.
It's all the climate issue.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROMA, DANILO COPPOL TO GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the second penal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the Immobiliary Danilo Coppola who had asked to marry his city, Grottaferrata, to a residence in Rome.
Coppola is investigated in the context of the investigation on the anti-patch on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
During the process on its load, last week, it has been obtained the discharge from the households transformed for residence obligations in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estateman might run the traject from the province town to a residence in the capital.
However, according to the court, these movements (which the pm has said otherwise) would allow him to influence his company and to prove it.
Elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago with the vote of the Representative Room against the 700 billion dollars safeguarded by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and it is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save it.
The New York Times of yesterday confirms that the crisis is going to break up the Republican Party, always more divided between its old East Coast, moderate, favorable to the federal and business inhibitations, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "the Washington" and the world of the finance, particularly strong in the Central and South States.
The soul, for the purpose of this, was probably alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
However, this is just an example of changes, big changes, which the current economic earthquake may pre-announce or already allow us to discover: not only in the United States but also in all the O'e and perhaps only here.
Whether in the uses and in Europe the crisis seems to work as a accelerator of incubation phenomenon from time to time and in the new climate, and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomenon is the renewal, the extraordinary restart, of the duplicate category of State-sovereignty in relation to a kind of renacionalisation.
The crisis, in fact, is the crisis of financial institutions which, yes, have a close relationship with the foreign, but that, first of all, the budgets of people and families who live in a single country, in a single State are largely involved.
What creates immediately a political problem for those who govern it: and how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families that, among other things, are also a electorate.
That is, the crisis appears economically worldwide, but politically it is almost exclusively in it.
The internal policyism seems essentially outside or does not have much to say: the lamping test is given by the European Union, which normally divides between the different interests and between the various state strategies, cannot decide any common policy line.
And this is from the Government of each single State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and restart plans, new rules, and particularly funding: since when you reach stress are only the States who possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that are able to try to restore things to six.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two incomeable resources, in certain circumstances, whereas no market and no internal organisation will be available in the same way.
This new approach that the crisis puts on the statual element is of the rest in perfect synthesis with the importance of the most recent developments of the European Union tend to attribute to a very closely linked factor to that element: territoriality.
In fact, in paradosis, while we were convinced that we were going into the kingdom of the network, of the more sophisticated technologies, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was about to dominate the world, we had a step that our future would have to make accounts increasingly with those little inmaterial things that are the water, the recyclings, the oil.
All that, looking at a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but yet are absolutely linked to a circled space, to a territory.
Because whoever is to be sovereign, it certainly has many cards more than who it is, who has the unfortunateness of living in a place without collection, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second news that predicts a fraction.
Who says Territorium, State, Government, inevitably says Politica, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomenons.
On the one hand the consciousness of the objective needs of authorised leadership, the request of someone who knows to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a weight of discretion for existing leadersships, economic species, revealed so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And together something more deeper and in a certain sense anxious: a discretion, an insult, an image of inappropriacy, a sense of distantness, which aims to involve the whole heading class in a growing number of O'e countries.
It seems to make it ever more road, in large areas of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elite until now growing, their way of hearing and being, their culture in full acceptance of the term, having done their time and to be more stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The request of leadership, in summary, feeds subterraneously a ramified but powerful movement to delegate the leader classs and traditional political assets, which is manifested in the immediate "electoral" or in the sudden runs of the collective humors of these recent and last times, from the conservative access in Austria-Baviera to the crowd of labourist consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American Congressmen against Bush (and maybe also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It has the impression that the elites travel, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their credited intellectuals, their format would say to someone, make them more difficult to understand, and then to represent, what is not currently taking shape in the deep parts of the west society, and that the economic crisis reveals, grows, acts potentially dismissed.
In front of all this, speaking of a "mass rebellion" at the agenda would be sincerely exhausted.
But keeping your eyes openly, certainly, isn't it for nothing.
The supercoal to walk on the walls
To violate the laws of gravity thanks to a super-eye and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of various American research centres and now a team of four sites has gone very much.
With only 2.5 metres squared, the students are able to hold a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American Science magazine has published discoveries of some researchers at Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of students is an evolution of existing people who use a specific carbon structure called carbon nanotubi.
“The principle of the Property can be imagined as a series of systemic tubes as a spaghetti pile” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
The scientists inspired the legs of the gechies, recovered by microscopic skins that can ensure a perfect adherence to animals.
The tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and veterate paper, have shown that the new accessive is ten times more powerful than the feet of these corrections and at the same time easily gets away from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Facilities of Ingıria of Dayton University.
PATH TO THE MORE? -"This material could be useful as a transitional accessive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are warm and electrical running drivers.
Other applications may be related to the space income.
There's nothing superheroes for the moment.
Other RICERCA – The University of Berkeley, in California, is also dedicating himself to search for a new accessible.
In a article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, the Californian students have presented a adessive format of microfibres as hairs that self-cover themselves from the powder during the movement on a surface to keep a perfect adderence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with sucking fruit
Attention to the pump suck, to the arance and meal.
These goods, particularly consumed in the sea because distants and vitamins, if they are taken simultaneously to some safe drugs, change the absorption by enhancing or reduced efficiency according to cases with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risks of fruit sucks be confessed that freshly associated with the adoption of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which from the 236th meeting in the American Chemical Society in the course of Philadel lays a new alarma: just a pompelmo, arance and meal suck to reduce the absorption of some saved medicines, cancel the benefits and risk the health of patients.
The pompelm suck was already completed under the reason that he thought he was to increase up to lives and considered toxic effects of some anti-arithmic, antibiotic, ansiolytic, anti-staminous and neurological medicines.
FARMACEUTICAL ARTICLES - The same Italian pharmacovigilance Agency had reported it in a 2-year information bulletin, warning doctors and patients not to undervalue the danger resulting from this mix and to take care of what it is drinking in the case of pharmaceuticals such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT SOLO POMPELMO - According to experts also the suck of arance and the meal contains substances that inhibite the pharmacists.
I long the list of active principles inhibited by the pump and the other sucks.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milano: "These discoveries generally are immediately reported to the various internal pharmacovigilance agencies and na.
So always reading the illustrative packages of medicines that are used and if there is something that is not clear, not make us impression, but ask us clearly to the doctor or pharmacist” stressed the expert to the Agency Ansa.
The Nobel del's to Paul Krugman
The Nobel premium for the Property has been signed to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neokeynesian who teaches the University of Princeton and is a famous editorial of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the choices in Bush administration and foreign policy.
A few months after the expectations of September 2001, in the days of Enron failing, Krugman had been planned in a editorial published on New York Times that the second event would be more determining than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A predict that was not a little polymetic and that for years has been reflected to the economy, but that has now been revealed exactly.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked for the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron or Worldcom were disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "valuable economy" but also a distributor with a very aggressive style, especially critical against the extent of freedom of Bush's administration.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to get usually more users from home to office from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by voluntary developers, whose spoils monitor SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the large public with different news: to the welcome and to the revised and less spared interface, are added more substantive, such as the national compatibility of the Apple Mac OS X operational system and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format), the latest ISO standard version.
Warning on interoperability with the Office sequence 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as that allows you to reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, for example useful to send them via electronic mail, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphical processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hibrid PDF" documents that collect the typical graph of the Adobe format with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text designer.
It is an element that has received various improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet you can intervene with more hands among different users, avoiding conflicts on the text processer, a color is signed in the comments for better revision capacity.
Some ascensions are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions on the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks the final result should be released.
The Italian version is downloadable to http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English on Friday mirror.
Furthermore, for Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may also be sent home or at work.
And if the theme of freedom can be a train for spread in the houses, it is in the area of business that Open Office is trying the big scom. It can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
And they do not miss the realities that offer a service of training, advice and ideal assistance for small and medium-sized, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding Word video record; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to calculate Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulator presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most important Access is the program he wants to work on the database; Draw, it is the graphical module.
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 miles, with the outcome of the new version, it is likely that you can also exceed the estimated number.
Kohl also is a positive result is the fourth case of do.
New case of positiveness to the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best scaler.
To report the news is the site of the team.
The 26-year Kohl is the fourth positive corridor to Cera, the Epo of third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Ricco and Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood campaigns includes those performed in the last weeks from Losanna and Chatenay-Mala.
If the control analysis confirms the positiveness in Cera, the Austrian will meet the third place at the Tour and will meet the two years of canonical equality.
Confirming the news of Kohl's positiveness to the third generation Epo is the head of the French Antido agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium at the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans span, also adjudicating the mad to a better scaler.
NEW YORK WHAT IS TO THIS THIS ITALIA IS RESIDENT?
Italy "from the country of immigrants has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for the immigrants".
This is transforming Belpaese into a nation of racists? Is it as much as you ask in a long article the New York Times who has dedicated a long article to the debate on the racism theme in Italy, departing from the case of young Abdul William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso the past month in Milano for stealing a scatter of bishops.
This case highlights what the Nyt defines the "nor paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those in which "more integration and more work" are recorded but also "the highest anti-immigrated feelings of the country and the highest support of the North League".
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also quoted the episodes of intolerance in Milano, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation from the Lega which enables immigration frens and facilitates the exemption of clandestines is also quoted as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The tendence underlined both by Papa and by the President of the Republic: "Georgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI to the Quirinale asked the State and the Church to work together to disregard racism."
Sacrifice students of carriers up to EUR 900 for a room
The universities market doesn't know the crisis.
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the inquiry syndicate, take a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milano, 700 in Firenze, 650 in Napoli, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has taken very serious characters to exclude all young people from the right to study for the highests complete that families should support - explains the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in this city the strong question from students has so deformed the market to introduce a generalized increase process also for residents."
In most cases, offers of office contain a series of violations: free-type contracts, not registered, without limits of canon, related sub-afficies.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the review of tax taxation, the prices may be calm.
By looking at the details of the investigation, we see that in Milano, for a bed place in Brianza, there are approximately 450 euros; for a single room it goes from a minimum of 650 (Swarm Band area) to a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria).
In Firenze a bed place covers in average 350/400 euros, a room of approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in near University areas, they need 250/280 euros for a double bed place, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in nearby universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Lower values only (550 euros for a single room) in areas near the other Universities (Hosts and Chinese cities).
It is saved only if it moves in perifer areas: EUR 300 for a bed and 450 for a single in the Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Napoli for a bed, there are 300/450 euros, for a room it is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Amminei areas.
In Bari for a bed, there are 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In the smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have more weight in the city.
In cities where the phenomenon of extracommunication students, such as Perugia, is more frequently recorded: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon asked for foreign students than that applied to the Italians.
Bye old film Paradiso, towns delete historical sales
History cinematographic sales shut up in favour of Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic salt is a blind city, it's like an eyeless face."
The picture offered by the registry Joseph Tornator photographs effectively as it is in the large Italian cities but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinema, with the birth of the great multisale and the consequent death for conjunction of monosal in the central cities, is one of those events that seem to us unusual and unconcerningly but also have all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
"It is as if there were less a friend, a knower with whom we shared a part of a road and many emotions," notes the new film of Paradiso, the film that 20 years ago was in Tornator the Price Oscar and the Great Price of Cannes' Jury, and that counted the poesy of a province room and nostalgia for a way to live the lost film may be forever.
The numbers provided by Anec, the main association of the exerites, are clear: In the last five years they have closed the 316 films of tradition, and paying the greater score are mainly the sales in the main cities: 10 less in Firenze, 9 in Milano, Napoli, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Torino, 5 in Palermo.
Among the most closed regions, Emily-Romagna is 82 persian monosala films, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And demonstrating that the first of their disappearance is the event of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new multisale films: 195% more in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 and in Toscana both in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irraally” notes Paul Protti, president of Anec,” it is useful to build new structures but should ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city room closes, not all its attendants are ready to transfer to multiplex.
In order to not then talk about the missing fund for the exercise fund: the State's price debt is about 10 million euros.
It is ashamed that the Government does not respect existing laws from the ethical and moral point of view.
In order to support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year.’
Interestingly in the case of Bologna, the first Italian city who, concerned about closures, decided to run to the repairs with the signing of a protocol between Commun and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala films both in the history center and in periferia.
Among the rules, there are measures for tax facilitation for public operators and benefits in mobility: the spectators can enter the limited traffic area and have special tariffs for substance and certain parkings.
"It's an initiative that I like," notes Joseph Tornator, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna, putting other measures in my feet.
It is true, however, that to contrary the strapoters of multiplex traditional sales must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more necessary.
The film tradition is a subject that always has been important for me: the closure of the SuperCinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adultery, was the shintilla that convinced me to do "New Movie of Paradise", which I thought for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of the way, I've been closed there, where I've lived so many divided emotions, so that I can't see the cartons from the powder I'm around from the other side."
Communications between politics and arrested officers of Gioia Tauro
"The officer of Gioia Tauro was to uniform the choices of the Community to the interests of the piroma cosca."
The accusations are serious that the judges of the Antimaphia Directory of Calabria refer to the office and neighborhood of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the officer of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested tomorrow for outside concurrence in mafia association.
In Manette also, Gioacchino Piroma, the elder's mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his lawyer's grandmother, the boss, already condemned for association for mafia printing crime, condemned to charge 10 million euros.
"It's a matter of legal and moral standard, as well as of good sense," writes the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay advice to the lawyer Piroma.
"It would have been so granted to the cosca - write the Jews - to officially enter the municipalities by facilitating the opportunities of the public administration, already big, control and indies."
The President of the Regional Calabre Joint Agazio Loiero does not hide that "conclusions between local and malvity organized entities" in his region are many: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in other, where the employment is almost unemployable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressure of the "dranghet, heroes who keep themselves clean."
Tomorrow's arrests follow the last July with which the police announced that he had decaped the piroma cosca.
At the end of April last, the Communal Council of Gioia Tauro was solved but already in 1991, and always for the consequences between organized crime and local administration, local politicians were raised by the task of administration of the Community.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Udc officer at the time of the shooting, was chosen at the head of a central right coalition, after the ballotation of May 2006.
He cried to the scandal when the Prefecture sold the Communal Council.
He called for the Minister of the Internal Mark Min, now, to have saved all for a political issue, but the Jews, in the order of arrest signed tomorrow, explain that the piroma cosca was even joined to ask the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental intercettions against Dal Torrione, writes pms, "the ability to marry the needs of an immigrant, representative of a larger group notorially to Piroma, uniforming the choices of public administration to the interests of the cosca."
When energy is born from the walls now the bigs descend in the field
It's a disappeared shipment, which takes over 70% of the planet's surface, and now it is discovered by the large global energy companies.
Where, running, the sea are the new renewable sources on which they have seen, and now they are trying to put their hands, colds like Chevron.
The possibility of recovery of energy from the sea movements is studied by hundreds of years and in the 1970s, together with the first petrolifer crisis, research increased.
When the oil price fell around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was partly, but now the environmental incidences and the new increase in oil are impulsive to the sector.
London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world electrical beam could be covered by the use of the seas injury.
This amount would be the double of that currently produced by nuclear centres.
And there would be rivers and sea.
I've been on the attack.
The first company to deal with marine energy was Enersis, which signed an agreement in 2005 to build a campaign in North Portugal.
When the mind was announced, it looked like a revolutionary.
At two years of distance on marine energy, they are always more and among these areas voted forever to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the ocean energy technologies - has declared the portfolio of a company associated with the American Oil Colossy at the Wall Street Journal Economic Day - and is evaluating the opportunity to cooperate with us."
This cooperation relates to the obtaining of an authorisation by the United States Energy Committee, necessary to launch a draft marine energy use in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially if it is considered that in Alaska uses continue to extract oil and recently President Bush started a plan for new trivellations.
Besides Chevron, there is the Ver > Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to walk through the street of energy that comes from the sea and the amounts invested until now, as it is not noted in the details, indicate, according to observers, an interest in the upper.
Technology to set up.
Experts are talking about a technology still in the woods, even because marine energy does not flee all doubts on the environmental impact.
For now, the impendings such as the Portuguese or some in Scotland are small and seem to not create big eco problems.
In order to produce energy on the long scale, however, if technology should be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, use a bow system connected between them.
The spint of the walls, which makes the bones move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the bullets.
Pressure turns a turbine that at her time feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to riva through submarine caves.
For now, there are four of this type of design, waiting only for federal approval and part of energy can serve for a military installation.
Instead, the Ver > Power already produces energy for a trade center and a parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when the sea is there turns the turbines' balls, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
The Verová said he had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to enjoy energy.
After the waters, the sea.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electric Energy Research, is currently deserving the potential of sea.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the walls and therefore more reliable as energy source.
It is exactly on the energy of the sea that were like the new York, ̈e and Alaska, together with other costs, have already invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and invested up to 35 million for 2009.
