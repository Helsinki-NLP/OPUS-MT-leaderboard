He's going to the car breakfast.
He was traveling to America.
He cut the cigarette on the cendres and put it down to go.
He began to cry.
He declared that the earth was turning back to the sun.
He left the book on the table.
He said the same since I met him.
He made a big bathroom.
I took the pilot with a hand.
I went to camp with my family.
I fell down in the wrong station.
I made a neglect.
I asked Mr.
I understood what you said
I heard her story.
I wrote a letter.
I wrote a kitchen book.
I was happy to see that he finally put his mind.
I read several books last week.
I noticed she was sitting at the front row.
I opened the box.
I thought he was hurt and he'd go.
I was the one who called the door.
I called before.
I've seen the guy's appealed for a car.
Wow, I'm sorry.
He fighted against racial discrimination.
We went out without him, because I wasn't ready.
He left from travel to the United States.
He died three years ago.
We called the door for a few minutes, but it was right.
They had to ampute the arm in Tom.
They passed on the theme on the instant.
It passed through my kitchen, seeing I didn't know me.
He lost all the money I had.
He painted the black door.
He's trying to pull it out.
It was great, I went to Kyoto.
She was deceived by her part left the door without closing the key when she went out.
It was anonymous offence that allowed the police to come to terrorists.
It was a great night.
It was a terrible week.
It was a crazy guy.
He was sitting in front so he could hear.
He returned home three hours later.
Come here every day.
I see the moon on the horizon.
Are you coming here every day?
Come on when you want.
Are you coming here every day?
We've got the winter in the winter.
Watch it with the cars in creating the street.
Come with us.
Come on when you want.
Come on when he wants.
Virtue and victory.

They live on the other side of the river.

I'd like to meet your old sister.
I'd like an aspirine.
I'd like a clearer tone.
We want full prayers.
I wanted to buy the book, but I realized that I didn't give more than 200 inches.
You want to marry me?
You want to do this now?
You want to play tennis with us?
You want to take another rate from you?
You want a beer?
He wants an hour like yours.
He wants an hour like yours.
You're higher than her.
You need it.
You don't have to eat it.
I want to go to America some day.
I want to learn the hope.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I want to stay here.
I want a book, where's the library?
I want to see the ocean.
I want to live in a quiet city with clean air.
