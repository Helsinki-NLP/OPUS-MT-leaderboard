The axis of steel may fly on the water surface because of the surface pen.
Spending on the surface is because water molecules at the surface of the water are strongly touched by each other more than they are for the air molecules over themselves.

The kitchen of a modern ice shooter has a double rate with a concave space between. These two borders make a better festival on the ice, even when the shooting is screwed.
Because the bottom of the sheet is a little boat, as the sheets of the one side or the other side, the border that is in contact with the ice is also bound.
This makes the shooter swimming. If the shooter is moved to the right, they move to the right, if the shooter is wrapped to the left, they move to the left.
To return to their former energy level, they have to get away with the additional energy they received from the light.
This will be done with a small light partial named "foton".
Scientists have named this process “stimated emissions of streaming” since the atomes are stimulated by the strong light and causes the sharing of a photo of light, and the light is a type of streaming.
The next picture shows that the atoms determine photos. In reality, photons are very less than they are on the picture.
Photos are still less than what atomes are consisting of!
After hundreds of hours the file operation will finally burn the lightspore and will not work anymore.
The light speed must be replaced. It is important to be careful for the exchange of lights.
First, the lighter must be disabled, or the puzzle must be removed from the contact.
