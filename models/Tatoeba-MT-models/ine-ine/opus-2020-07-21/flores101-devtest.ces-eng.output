The PP population hasn't changed, still have the same adaptation as before.
In the process of the adjustment of the new population to its new population, they start looking less and less as the remaining population.
Finally, for some thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that it is possible to consider the same type.

The most easily available vegetable resources would be white pools available in lists and bullets, but they are difficult for us for primates if they are not able.
Furthermore, animal food (mravens, termites, ova) is not only easily fertilised but also provides a high amount of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
