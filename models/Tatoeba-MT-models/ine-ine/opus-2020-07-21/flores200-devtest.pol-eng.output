In this new environment, there are different resources and different competition, so the new population will have to develop new properties or adjust it in such a way that you can effectively competite in a new environment.
The first population hasn't changed, and it must still be the same.
In time, when the new population is adapted to a new environment, it is less similar to other populations.
The end of the end, when thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will be different in the same way that it will be difficult to call them one species.

The plants grow to savanage with the effort allow the primary sacks with grass systems such as people to satisfy the need for the body for aminowases.
Moreover, abandoning this may have significant consequences: maintaining growth, immortality, and at the end of death.
The most easily available plant resources would be the white contained in letters and pieces, but for primary sacks such as us are difficult to die without pre-preparation.
Otherwise, it is with food of animals (morrows, termits, eggs), which easily grass and large quantities of whites containing all significant aminowases.
Taking into consideration everything, it should not be surprised that our foreigners have resolved their "white problem" in a similar way as they do this now with nympanses to savanage.
