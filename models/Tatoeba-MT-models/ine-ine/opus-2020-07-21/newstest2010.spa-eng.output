The diploma, medalla and the cheque of 1.4 million dollars will, among other things, receive them by the efforts to strengthen the global diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The chief of the White House and his wife Michelle will come to the Norwegian metropolis tomorrow and will have much to do.

The visit will run with a ceremonie in which Obama will receive the prestigious galardon.
It will be the fourth President and it will receive it, even though the third who receives it in his charge.
The White House has already announced that when receiving the premium, he will talk about the Afghanistan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that it is receiving the premium as a president of a country currently in war in two countries.
His war efforts increased more with the sending of additional groups to Afghanistan, which does not want to mention any of its critics.
In the ceremonie, Obama will also receive the gold medalla, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided to what organisation it is in particular.

Brno doesn't like the containers to separate the weapons
In Prague, citizens can separate drink packagings and in South Moravia towns can be found containers to separate wheat everywhere.
What about Brno?
There you need a few minutes to find their containers.
I don't want to make Brno separate for anything.
I think, to be the second largest city of the Republic, the meetings are not enough to be interested in this problem.
Brno is completely lost in the division of wheels, not only because we, citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but especially by the number of containers for those residues.
Have you ever tried, for example, to bring a PET bottle into the centre to the appropriate container?
It's almost impossible, especially all, it's a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found until now is on the Place Mo©néské, of la Po©ená Huse.
That Mr. Underka and your companions don't hurt me, but that seems too little.
It is not necessary to mention that in other parts it is also not easy to separate the weapons.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By vagance
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I don't surprise.
I offered myself, after a party, to take a few glass and plastic bottles.
But in the Kaunicova Calle I didn't see any red container nearby.
Happy, going to the tranway, I found the right place.
However, the weapons were already rebounded from the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?
What happens is that Propertyology and Stethics seem to be not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the town the extraligg of hokey, which has us in all the Republic, and do not buy more containers or offer the separate of other materials to Brno is more âge.
I'm glad that I can compare my opportunity, after browsering the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
If the EKO-KOM society is, Brno is actually the worst of the region of Jihomo's country.
The "Paroubek" budget removed money from income and disease subsidies
After the left, despite the Government's opinion, added funds for agricultors or officers, there may be no enough money in the budget for rents, disease subsidies or building.
But not for the interests of the international debt or debt.
This will threaten all those governing in the second half of the next year, says the Ministry of Hacienda Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists had introduced the increase for some groups, the Government would posterously ask for a loan for sensitive expenditures, rents or subsidies of disease. "This is only to replace the problems for the future, it is to put mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when money is taken, it must pay all higher interests and, once, money must be acquired.
The State has no many options to get money.
If it does not reduce the social subsidies or the State's functioning costs, the taxes must be increased.
To all who added to the left now: bombers, teachers, agricultors.
And later, too, to your children.
People don't have to be concerned about income or subsidies of illness, they will receive them; from these accounts, 1.800 million have disappeared.
But the price to pay will be the increase of public debt; the year coming will not be missing only 163.000 million, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase with the costs of interest.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer get to increase the VAT easily or to reduce maternity subsidies, as the government did in its package against deficit.
Because of the allocation of money in favour of some electoral groups, the year coming will also miss five billion million to finish the building of autoways and railways.
It is, in particular, of the sectors in which the claim has already been held and where the building process has already been started, which projects cannot be changed and cannot also be reduced.
The maximum thing you can do is keep them, which is not even free.
This means delay or stop of the thirteen large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warning the carrier of the Karel Hanzelka Transport Minister.
CHSSD proposed a Solomon solution for reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the dividends of CHEZ, which is greater property of the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe or is a unfunded sack.
The previous year of CHEZ was intended for the budget of 18,000 million.
Each year of the dividends are liquided by ecological damage, they serve to complete the account for rents or serve as a reserve for prepared rent reform.
Moreover, with this truck, EU rules, increase the actual budget deficit at 5.7% of the BDP.
The carnaval of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to grant several refunds to the victims of communism and crimes, or for the expenditure of litigiums, even in the building.
It is not clear whether the State will need those funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international litigation, maybe we'll have to pay it, Janota.
The Minister will then have to cover money within the resort or, in the worst cases, to take hand from the reservation of the Government budget.
It is also missing hundred million for the State Pokladna project (State Caja), whose price is of two billion and which has already been started.
The first step begins in January.
If the Minister of Affairs does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and bring sanctions, he advises Janota.
Your future smart phone can work with two operating systems
They will count with a mobile phone where the user can, by pressing a key, change between several operating systems.
Reveled plans sound promising.
Only pressing one key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Exactly this option is the objective of the company and VMware, which is focused mainly on the development of computer software.
In your mobile you can take two user profiles at the same time.
They can change between them and divide them between the house and the work.
Both operate at the same time, she indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the computer magazine.
It was presented in November of the last year and has been shown for the first time a few days ago.
It will be launched in 2012.
Intelligent phone allocation is no more.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where those systems work at the same time, Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in their apogeo.
The VMware company cooperates with European operators and and ́s to test smartphone installation tests and these phones will come to customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains concern hotels
Not only telescope holders in Krkonoche are concerned about tracks without snow.
The lack of snow makes people don't reserve stations of ski in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonosse, free rooms for all winter dates, including Nochebuena and Nochevieja, can still be obtained.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but he still fears to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, if these Natives will have snow or bar," mentioned the maintenant of the computer portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass in Spindlerov Mlyn a Nochevie is their expectations, should not be doubted anymore in reservating the stay.
Those who prefer rebuilding money and put the quality of accommodation in second, may try to wait for a few more days.
Spindlerov Mlyn Hotels offer mostly all weekly stations for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will ceder and offer shorter stations.
And then free rooms will be sold quickly, he estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabi travel agency, still offers free beds for all the days of the winter.
Now, what's more interested in us is the Navy week, which is still not complete.
The half of the offered places is still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared some ships last time," mentioned the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi Travel Agency can still offer Nochevie in Krkonosche, but there are less free places.
It is also sold very well for the first 14 days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stations is threatened by the lack of snow in Krkonosche.
People's waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to pass the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks remain near during the week, the birthdays will also be deceived," she says Schiefert.
In contrast, it is a little easier to occupy rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Snežkou; the last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free places.
The interest increases during the Poland vacations in January and February also sells well," reported the best hotel director in Pec, Karel Rada.
The eighteen percent of Nochevie's stations are also occupied in the Omnia hotel, near the central parking in Janské Láznie.
In contrast, in the recent hotel of Janské Láznie in Christmas the half of the beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, since we have seen about a sixty percent of the employment capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as the snow falls, the interest in stations in Krkonosche will certainly increase, mentioned by Erik Sporysch, the director of Omnia Hotel.
However, now it seems that Krkonosche's hotels will pass the snow gains waiting.
Thursday the temperatures must fall and, if there are precautions, in the mountains should not be possible.
But afterwards, Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, reported the Hydrometheorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It is comic that Barack Obama, the president with the most intelligent man's reputation, as a diligent student repeats in the matter the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself took for the most stupid.
When he finally discovered his Afghanistan approach, expected with anxiety, it was shown that it was a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the "igual" statement as in Iraq, but it also wasn't vacilled to use the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own declaration: "A new way towardsward".
It was himself, who criticized Bush's idea to send new military refugees to Iraq, the country that suffers from civil war, and that criticized it as "unresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so there is nothing about Iraq in the news today.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however, objectively left its successor a much more favourable initial situation than he had to wait.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects to repeat the milestorm.
Field captains again requested him to increase the military quota, especially the commander of the General Afghanistan Operation Stanley McCristal. He, even despite the traditional subordinated relations, submitted to the incidences in the White House to a strong critical.
He asked 40,000 men to be able to improve the situation.
The president washed for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he deceived the general over 100,000 military.
It has succeeded that Europe would promise you another 5.000, although he was already counting at at least 100,000.
The most difficult of the entire Obama strategy seems to be its goal, starting to take off the Afghanistan troops in 18 months and complete this procedure in three years. The whole learning of Obama was generating more questions of the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the growth gives the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratrised wars in recent years, Iraq's society is well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is fulfilled.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare for the Afghanistan security forces, if they are used to change the head every day if they need.
Political institutions, even though formally established, will continue to be only a people of Potemkin. After him, they will remain patriarchal relations.
Equilibration of the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated because of confusions, even more complicated by Pakistan and Iranian influences.
Not if it is to establish a state that is "action capacity", a minimum objective of all the operation, it seems very real.
The time of Obama's strategy is shocking for its voluntaryness.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to be embarrassed, and now it is going to break.
Only one romantic soul, who doesn't know anything about the reality, can believe that military men sent to war to "come quickly home," will do some thousands here.
From the political point of view, the date of derogation of the troops is pure irresponsibility, since the Talibans will consider it as an indirekte declaration of crime and crime.
The last summary of the NATO showed that Europeans are at least willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don't know, and they do not want to explain to their electors, which relationship has German or Italy's security with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, able to radically affect the situation, is the development of the actions in Iran.
If the situation continues to threaten and increased sanctions do not affect Iranian, the United States will have to take a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers exactly when, if Obama, America starts the triunphal retirement of the Afghanistan troops.
Each solution, however, will mean a dramatic reveal for the Afghanistan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is that there are three years for the presidential elections, and therefore there is still a long time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs' guidelines will not receive the bonuses in reality
High executives of the Goldman Sachs will not receive the bonuses in this year.
It was announced to react to the hard critical of its payment practices.
The group of 30 high guidelines shall receive, instead of money, actions which cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
Furthermore, the actions may be removed in case they would have assumed significant risks.
The agency Re日s, Goldman Sachs became the leader in the efforts to join the bonuses in Wall Street with the long-term power.
I guess that Wall Street is fully conscious of the longest way that he should take, mentioned the ex-inversionist of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs’s criticism has been after having approximately 17,000 million dollars (approximately 300,000 million CZK) for bonuses in the first three trimesters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in this year, the agency Re日s, probably exceeds, despite the currently announced measure, the $20,000 million.
High bonuses in the sector were made, with the arrival of the financial crisis, to a policy-related issue.
Great Britain announced the midnight he planned to record once, with a tax of a fifty per cent, the bonuses for the over 25.000 litres (approximately 712.000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prices in all less Physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, received today in Stockholm from King Carlos XVI Gustavo de Switzerland the Nobel Prices of this year, in specialized and in-specific categories.
Besides the four centimeters, he also figured among the premises a German writer of Roman origin, Herta M ।
The Nobel Medical Premium received him two biology and .. Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his companion Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemical received the Israelite Ada Jonath and the Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of § and the function of the ribosomes.
The last delivered premium, the Nobel Premium of Economy, received it to Elinor Ostrom and his companion Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a premised woman, was Physica.
This premium has been received today by the scientists Charles Kao for research in the area of optical caves, and George Jobith with Willard Boyle by the inventor of the CCD chip, which is the base of all digital cameras, faxs or telescopes.
Each premises collected the diploma, Nobel's medalla and the certificate of money received.
This sum in each category is from up to ten million Swedish corones (approximately 25 million Czech corones).
In the case of several premises in each category, the premium is divided between themselves.
The traditionally expected Nobel, the peacemaker, received him today afternoon in Oslo, Norway, President and Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of being premised, since it is at the beginning of his career and also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
In order to defend its policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are inconsistent to achieve peace, although their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the dimission. Klaus invited Castillo
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning to Eduard Janota, which is planned to remain in the government, because it is not in accordance with the version of the State budget for the next year, which was approved by the lawyers' camera.
The Budget, and maybe also Janota's stay in the office, will be the subjects of her Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
If he is, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public funds.
The meeting was informed by President Radim Ochvat.
About his stay in the function, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
The budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, should be governed by the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163,000 million crowns.
The lawyers' camera, however, adopted Wednesday the proposals on the left for fund transfers and increased money for officers, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government is not in accordance with the proposals of social democrats, since they increasing budget deficit.
A serious conflict of internal policy has occurred between the left and the Government and the Government, and the other, because of this conflict, the future activities of the Office of Fischer, whose form was agreed in primavery by the ODS, the CHSSD and the Green Party.
Criticals believe that the budget, in the version approved by the lawyers' camera, actually liquidates the package of emergency measures imposed by the Government of Fischer to cover public debt.
Klaus may, but he does not have to sign the State Budget law; he has stated today during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long a long time in this "the serious problem", meaning "the non-sustainable deficit" of the public commitment.
It is he today that they do not have a good solution anymore.
Only a strong government, which can be supported in a larger consciousness between political parties, could improve this situation, says the President.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is wonderful and that the government should think about its future existence.
The President of ODS, Petr Netime, said to ČTK that the concept of the bureau office with the support of CHSSD, ODS and the Green does not work anymore.
Prime Minister Fischer repeated and qualified similar words of " strong sensations".
The Chief of ChSSD, Jiří Paroubek, repeated before Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit is wonderful, prepared for this year by the ex-government of Topolánek. It will exceed the 200,000 million crowns.
Thursday, CHSSD said that the approval of the State Budget for the next year was successful.
The populars were also happy.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood movie, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans are saying that the new film of Hollywood, Invictus: Invensive, reports much about the country, their fighting and their victories, although some critics say that the protagonists are playing them.
The story talks about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The incansable fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in its biography by the actor and winner of a Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, a 91-year-old, asked him to interpret her in Eastwood movie.
Another important role plays Matt Damon.
I said to him, "When you interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The actor of seventy-two years, who received the premium for his role in Eastwood's drama on the world of the box Million ́ Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement by the abolition of slavery, which ended to be slave, of the chairman of the United States, and even of God in Evan the Almighty. But rarely represented someone who remains alive and, for many people, is so important as Mandela.
The former South African statist was 27 years in prison for its activities to end the apartheid in the South African Republic.
It was released in 1990, and for four years it became president of the country.
In 1993, he received the Noble Premium of the Peace.
Invictus - Invencible is a Latin word and the title of a poema of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was talking like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, which joined its forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pimann, to help join the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid, his nation remains racial and economically divided.
He thinks he is able to join his people at the deport, and therefore it is decided to join the rugby players, who belong to the outsides in the world measure.
The South African team reached the World Copa in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years so Mandela's story came to the Chinese.
He had no other goal to play this role in such a way that it was the most likely to the reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world political were out of the same area, they would have meet Mandela, sniff with him, be among bastiers before his talk.
The most important thing was that he wanted to make Mandela's hand.
I discovered that when I appreciate your hand, I received your energy, this was transmitted and had the sense of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pinner, the captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players were predominant.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harder rugby world.
A great surprise for him was when he finally met with Pinner for the first time in his house.
Remembering having called the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pinner in my life was: "I look much higher in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences between the persons of the operators and their real models, and under the management of Director Eastwood, Invictus: Invensive has received positive records and is also spoken of ambitions for Oscar.
The Daily Variety Todd McCarthy film critic summarized its evaluation with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film records on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received a 76 percent of positive evaluations.
The secret of the spreader over Norway solved: the Russians made evidence of a misleading
On Norway, a special effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Russian Defense Minister ended recognizing that near Norway's borders proved a Balistic intercontinental mission.
The misleading has failed again. The missile, of type "Bulava", previously intended to be the proud of the Russian army, is becomeing the weakness of the Russian Generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not if he has repeated presence in the tests of the missile, he has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or occurred a mistake in the air.
In the Russian periods they write "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but it's.
This, the 13th test, has not occurred at the beginning.
At the end of the flight, technical problems have occurred again in the equipment.
Test the engine was stuck at the third stage of the mixture.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the Nuclear Sea Dmitry Donskoy, which flotted in the White Sea.
This type of mixture allows the movement from a ship that is moved and is sumerged at the same time.
That is why the mystery light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failure "Bulava".
The Norwegians from the first time did not vaccinate that it was a Russian mission.
Generals this time determine, not simply speaking of a failure.
The first two steps in the mixture were endured and the beauty occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately reported at the first stage.
Although no of the employment has passed completely without errors, the management of the Defence Minister was only six of the thirty.
The success of almost fifty per cent full of optimism to the Generals and therefore continue that "Bulava" will fly a day without problems and that will even be able to bring up ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, with a maximum weight of 1,15 tonnes.
The Legendary Fetisov signed at 51 years a annual contract with CSKA de Moscu
The Legendary of Defensor Viacheslav Fetisov will be presented again at 51 years a professional hokey meeting.
The former world campaign, olympical campaign and winner of the Copa Stanley will help your CSKA Moscú team and may be playing Friday in KHL's luck against San Petersburg.
Fetisov ended his professional career at the age of 40 in 1998 and now presided by the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was wounded, we need urgently another defendant.
Fetisov continues and has been committed to help the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, quoted the AP agency to Sergei Nemchinov, the trainer of the Moscu club.
It is still not clear if the return of the player will be referring to one single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the encouragement of the other players, mentioned Nemchinov.
It is AP if Fetisov returns to ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player of the Russian hokey.
The front legendary Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty and a year, during the entire season, and reached 15 goles and 26 assistants.
The largest group of the five famous Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hokey players in the history.
Playing by the Soviet Union wined two olympical hours, seven world campaigns, trionphed in the Canadian Cope and in the world's world campaign.
In the second part of his career, the NHL also succeeded: playing with Detroit wined the Copa Stanley two times.
Since 2001, he is a member of the Hockey Gloria Room.
Hyundai fulfilled the requirements of the syndicates. He will cancel all additional work
The direction of the car factory in Nošo agreed with the syndicates to cancel all additional work.
Exactly for the common additional work, the syndicates declared the emergency on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vanýk, the portator of the Hyundai car factory.
The direction, however, wants to agree with the syndicates for this year a more weekend tour.
We can't resign our manufacturing plan, because it's essential. So we proposed additional voluntary work for the Sabbath 19 December, which is, it will work in two tours, said Vaniquek.
Sedmička.cz is server, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on the Sabbath tour.
The bonus will also be paid for the Sabbath last, 28 November.
See Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
The employees can cover the bonus for extra hours or take a free day on December 28, which is to extend on one day the ship partys, mentioned in Vanique.
Moreover, all employees from the Sabbath tours will receive money for the journey and food.
Since the additional work was the most urgent and difficult point of the comments and boxes of the syndicalists and holguists, who stopped the production last week, the direction last week decided immediately to cancel all the additional work for December, Vanýk mentioned.
The employees of the car manufacture have seen obligation to work two hours more than eight hours, and this situation has lost almost every day until the last week.
After signing the agreement, the syndicates will cancel the emergency of the hole.
Another negotiation between the manufacturer and the syndicates should be carried out on Monday morning.
The Chief of Syndicates Petr Kuchař said Wednesday, that if they are committed to comply with the requirements and sign the document, they are ready to cancel the occurrence by juice.
The situation in the car factory was decreased last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously entered into the cold additional jobs.
They also protested against the bad conditions of payment and the suspect of accusation.
The direction thought that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and to provide cars.
Syndicalists in their statement of the emergency on Monday, also said that no of the employees, who interrupted the production on midnight, were punished in any way.
As regards the additional work, syndicates require that the company reduce it at least.
Moreover, this year they re­employ for this work a remuneration of 5.000 coronas.
The car factory in Noscho Hyundai has currently 2.000 employees.
Serial production was started last November.
By the last September, it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is of 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance up to the HIV's 'calculated' virus
The Science Team of Czech and Germans tests of new components to moderate HIV propagation in the body
The main benefit of this improved substance is that it is effective too against drug resistant virus.
In some cases, this is more important than the fact that the composition is not so effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some medicines already.
AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients may be significantly extended by a mixture of medicines that imped HIV replication in the body.
However, your use has many secondary effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely removed, the called resistent virus will be created; against them, the medicines are not functioning anymore.
The work of the experts of three Institutes of the Czech Republic of Scientists, VCHCHT Prague and Heidelberg university shows the possibility of dominating the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that metal-carbonated substances have effect on the albumin, responsible for the propagation of HIV virus.
Metallocarbons are bovine, agogeneous, carbon and cobalt compositions.
These compositions block the spread of the virus in a different way than all medicines used today, and therefore the problem of resistence can be solved.
In his work, scientists find new, "bettered" compositions, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metallocarbons have one three-dimensional tridimensional: two polyhedrons composed of bore, agglome and carbon atoms are united by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
HIV protease is a HIV virus albumin, and it is insincentable for the vital cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, VIH virus fraction is not produced and no mature and infectious virus bodies would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the propagation of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explain in a press news published by the Organic and Biochemical Institute in the Czech Republic of Scientists.
In a article published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of composites, where two pairs of bottles (see table) are united by a short organic series, which is still systematicly modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of anti-VIH protease substances was performed in probeth, and also against their resistent variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metal carbons on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medicinal products often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes makes, that metal carbons are interesting components for research with the aim of offering effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlína Reezáčová, the head of the biological and biochemical chemical and molecular genetic Institute in the Scientific Academy.
Fight for the Budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the year coming is "wonderful" and the Government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, if he is, think of his future existence.
The ODS statements were signed by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say it's left time for the analysis.
The President of ODS Petr Netime said that the concept of the bureau office with the support of CHSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously not working anymore.
In time, the Prime Minister must decide whether in the lawyers' camera he wants to be supported in minority, which is to fight the growing deficit, or if he wants to remain in his position with the aid of the parliamentary left.
The ODS and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit are completely different, warned in time.
The lawyers' camera yesterday adopted the budget for 2010, however, with the changed proposals on the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The lawyers' camera increased the money for public officers, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the proposals of ODS, since the budgetal deficit is strictly increased.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the Government's desire, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusion and uselessness
The Ministry of Hacienda, Eduard Janota, spoke of disillusion and feeling of inutility; the Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government would again appreciate the current situation.
Sometimes it is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten the dismission in case of approval of the amendments, the situation could be different.
See Czech TV Janota requested a place with the Prime Minister.
He signed, that you're thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is its disillusion for the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against budget deficit, it is not time in the Government to do anything to do by the CSSD appointed, which has made changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say, if the camera accepts other laws that increase deficit, such as subventions in disease, rents, or amendment to the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS have no fault
It is the matter of the Prime Minister Fischer and of all the government.
The Ministers appointed by the ODS did not do anything bad, subrayed Topolánek in the news of the United States text.
He recalled that there are people who belong to TOP 09 in several ministerial offices, who voted against the budget.
Sometimes he stressed that if Fischer decided to resign the principle of the fight against the deficit of the public deficit, "is absolutely logical and right, which is supported on the majority of the issatisfactors, which is currently in the lawyers' camera."
However, it can not count on the support and tolerance of the members of the ODS.
I didn't think about this, when it was time, I'll take care of it, and he said to the journalists in the lawyers' camera, the Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the Government exactly by the members of the ODS.
The Prime Minister Fischer went afternoon to a European Council's responsibility in Brussels.
ODS requested the Prime Minister
In time, the ODS would probably vote against the modified budget on midnight, if the Prime Minister does not ask the ODS lawyers to allow the budget to be accepted.
We don't feel as orphans, we're not small children, he replied to the question, if the ODS does not care about the lack of the party's head in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the negotiations on the budget.
He didn't realize that my vote was missing.
When the mandate was released, he knew that in the following months it was treated in particular on the bulk of the lawyers' camera and the destruction of all the positives, Topolánek himself repeated.
The new train time of the CD will be less trains for almost the same tariff
Czech dráhy (Ferrocarriles Checos) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less useful fast and local trains and, in contrast, will strengthen some links.
The total trade performance will be reduced to two percent compared to today, after the new train time is entry into force.
Most of the tariffs include the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of linking to capital will, for example, win the residents of the Ostravsko region, drahy for this line will add pendoline carretera.
The direct train, in contrast, will not be able to acquire Bratislava again.
On the Praga line - Písek - České Bu月o will be less fast trains, the direct links will be limited to Praga - Letohrad.
In the regions, the largest reduction in the transport planned by drohy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight per cent in total, in contrast, will increase the transport in Prague and the surroundings.
Two night trains will also be cancelled in the Trace Praga - Tabor - České Bu月o and some quick trains on the Praga - Písek - České Bu ։ It will be reduced only to some weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line of Milo in Prague, the people of Milo − must change to Lysá na Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esco system, in the cities around, its opening is possible thanks to the electrication of Lysá nad Labem line to Milo.
The links to long distances to the capital will end at the Praga Hla naraží station.
ChD will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Praga and Ostrava and trains to Shumperk/Jesenik every two hours.
From 13 December, the travelers will not again travel to Bratislava to Pendolino.
The account for regional railways of this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the demonstrable calls of Dráhy will receive the year coming four billion crowns in total as this year. The local trains are charged by the regions, the year coming will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more decent.
For fast and drahy drahy trains, they have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always a year.
Dráhy is happy with the system, and maybe they have not increased the prices of a large majority of the billets.
The changes will be made only in the billets of one day - CHD Net and the eLiška eLiška online billets.
For travelers without customer card, the price of CHD Net will increase from 450 corns to 600 corns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was the single price of 160 crowns for travel between two regional cities.
Philippines armed continue to arrest more than 50 people, children were free
The armed have sealed 75 people in the south of Philippines today, including several students of a primary school and their teachers.
The AFP agency, which previously informed only about 65 sequestrates.
All 17 children arrested and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The square was produced in the South Augustan province.
They say that approximately 19 weapons use rehens as a living escado in the flight before the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree with the delivery of residues.
The AFP agency belongs to the New Popular Armed (NPA), a weaponsed fraction of the Philippines Communist Party (CPP).
The AP agency was previously persecuted the sequencers due to violence, which caused the adjustment of the accounts between two classs of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the Maguindanao provincy, it was due to the recent murder, where 57 people died, imposed the martyr law.
Among the victims of killing of 23 November, with the elections of the Governor, there were 30 journalists.
For the doubt of the implication in murder, they arrested the Governor of this province in the south of Philippines and their father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of a influential dinastia of the Ampatuanians.
On the Mindanao Island, Muslim separatists also operate.
However, on Tuesday, they renewed the peace dialogs with the Philippine Government.
The RSA story refers to all the world, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next days, a new movie of Hollywood, Clint Eastwood Invictus (official title in Checo esInvictus: Neporaženy), which takes part of the biografie of the former president of South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the worldwide fighter against the apartheid plays Morgan Freeman, whom he has chosen for years ago for the protagonist role of the Mandela.
The second paper, the legendary of the campaign in rugby Francoise Pinik, interpreted it by Matt Damon.
External is born of critical and public reactions
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Price for the freedom of thinking, in 1993 he received, with Klerk, the Nobel Premium of the Peace.
He was the President of the South African Republic in 1994-1999.
large hopes, since it comes to the public at the time when the South African Republic is prepared for the world campaign in football, and the media are at the same time stressed by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the people by the dominant black majority.
The AP news agency has been positive reactions to this new movie in RSA, despite many reservations against the distribution of protagonist papers by Hollywood's "no interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new movie.
For many years, I dreamed with the paper and prepared me well to perform it.
Sometimes I met with Nelson Mandela, to - as it says - cover its energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festival street in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember the personage and message of Mandela at the movie.
It's a story of the South African Republic, but it refers to all the world, he added.
In the carrying of the national rugby team
The movie is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin with the title translated freely In the role of the host: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game, the nation was born. Retracted to the South African advocate of human rights during its first electoral presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the movie is trying to join two groups of people, racially and for long years separate. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as a protagonist is also putting the trail of the national rugby rugby team and entering the game field.
By entering the grass in the tray, which is considered in RSA as something almost sacred, Mandela won great ovations for 14 years ago, especially the white public and the recognition of white people.
The football campaign may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned the rugby Chester Williams player, the only "swarm" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if it improves the stressed situation in the RSA.
However, the white South Africans are skeptics, as he said in a recent interview for LN, a rubby Christopher Dawson, who fled from his country to British.
The campaign begins on 11 June 2010.
Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of millions of coronas
The incendium has reached the morning a Transformer of the Cheps company in a box of interruptors near the village Výskov in Lounsko.
See Lucas Marvan, the carrier of the bombers in the Usti region, the incendium is extinguished by six groups.
Previously, the bombers wanted to allow the transformer to be destroyed by the fire, but later they changed their opinion and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, spum and a special extintor material.
The incendium was caused by a technical defect, the cortocycle of the transformer.
There were no wounds, namely Pavla Mandátová, the voter of the company, notice does not threaten the security function of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is of a number of million crowns, it will not be exactly possible before the incendium is exhausted.
If mandate is required to replace the transformer destroyed by a new.
In the ten years of Cheps' activity, nothing similar happened, this type's beauty are sprayable, he added.
See Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the voter of the CHEZ society for the North Chech, the suppliers of the trip was not cut down, and the incendium of the substation does not affect the functioning of households, offices or companies.
A.s. Cheps acted in the territory of the Czech Republic as a maintenance of the distribution system, of the drive of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Keep in good state, renew and develop 39 interruptor boxes with 67 transformators, which carry the energy of the transmission system to the distributor system, also maintain the drive of 4339 km long.
Jančura will present a complaint for a challenging trial of ChSSD.
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura will present today a claim for calamity to three social democratic herds.
It is Michal Hašek de la region Jihomo's country, Radko Martínek de Pardubisk country and el hetman de Olomoucky country Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in 20 minutes in Radiojurnal.
The request must be regarded by the company's efforts, maintaining regional railway transport in some regions.
However, all regions ended signing contracts for the long term with the Tschechische drahy.
All three Hethmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the passports of the past", but we only brought the offer for what they wanted.
Afirman, that we are more dear than Cheška dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dráhy, which were fixed last week.
So we don't have anything else to defend us.
It's for the calamity to the Student Agency Society, he said to Radiojurnal Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time the evidence of all regions, which has not taken any necessary measures in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an invo for the European Commission.
Hashek considers this claim for the continuation of Mr. Jančura's average show, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course, I'm prepared to defend my good reputation and the region and I call the others who do it too.
I think that in this case, too, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the area of railway transport, and uses false and false arguments, Hashek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that would invest several million crowns in publicity, which would be the objective of warning these measures in the regions.
Radiojurnal said that she would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the new Year.
He needed that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional railway links and for the debt of approximately 150 billion crowns no tender.
Similar steps are in accordance with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura has been threatened by a Member of the CSSD due to its crytic of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we'll be able to hold bus licences.
It was presented as a lawyer of the CHSSD, I know, what Mr. is, I'm not going to say his name, said Jančura to Radiojurnal today.
Neumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
Neumococal vaccine from January will end the customs.
As the first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions have already appeared, that the obligation vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccine against neumococos are cool.
The Medicinal Institute is already fixing the maximum prices of vaccines, which are acquired by insurance companies.
Experts have also made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
Since January, the neumococal vaccine may be received freely for children born since 2 August of the last year.
It is not received or received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with vaccine last or before have to cover other doses of the vaccine too.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of age.
In the past year, the fourth part of the family was voluntary to vaccinate their children against neumoccus.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 coronas and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccine the youngest children.
In general, experts estimate that insurance companies will cost in vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
Without breast-feeding, the treatment is needed for non- vaccinated children.
Even now the state has exposed all the vaccination of the children about 500 thousand per year.
The vaccination was started by Janota's named package.
Neumococo is the cause of medium otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Nemokratical infections in our country die each year, investigations in hospitals are 28 children not more than 10 years old.
In addition to the Czech Republic of the Neumococal Vacuna was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine obligatory?
However, at the same time there are opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
Since January, it must be held by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, the leader of the Civic Association of Nalas.
Its association has propagated the neumolocal vaccines since a long time.
Experts at a international conference, where our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we had the voluntary vaccine.
It's not perfectly ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to take now, mentioned Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against neococos.
At this point we don't think of it absolutely, he said his portator Vlastimil Srszeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its disappointments, doctors
The president de la societary de pediatras Expert Society of practical child doctors Hana Cabrnochová recognises that la vaccine voluntarian has sus desventajas.
If all children would receive the vaccine, they could be reasoned for the reduction of the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand the political decision of starting vaccination as voluntary," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect that from the year coming over 80 percent of young parents let their children vaccine against neococos.
Neumococal vaccine is also a big change because as the first vaccination in children is inherited by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companys should cost more money in the profilaxis, so that they will be in the treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
The doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
However, children are concerned about the buying of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, as when the state gives other vaccines.
Some Members, however, feared that insurance companys could "take the money from health security".
The doctors will therefore have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatres will invest in vaccines 40,000 per month, which is a significant amount.
It's not going to be easy, says Cabrnoch.
The son of a artist and involved "in the robe of a museum"
The son of the renamed artist of the North American fantasy, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal valuable paintings in $20 million and $12 million from his father's museum.
The Pensylvania police that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 tables in his vehicle and replacement.
Afirman that Frazetta and another man used an excava in the museum, in the region of the Pocon Mountains.
Frazetta father, 81 years old, is famous for his representation of persons such as Conan the Barbaro and Tarzán.
The News Agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer said that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The Agency informed that Frazatta's son, 52 years old, stated before the police that his father had ordered him "in the museum in any way to transfer all the tables to a deposit".
The Agency said that Frazetta father refused to have granted that permission.
The workshop determines the increases of tax in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure in the pre-budget report, against the criticism of opposition, companies and syndicates.
The Conservators said that Alistair Darling was a chance to show his seriousness on the deficit's degree, repeateding the decisions until after the elections.
The Ministry of Hacienda has also received hard criticism to prevent low and medium income workers.
Among its main proposals, there are 0.5% of the social security expenditure and 1% in the public salary agreements since 2011.
Colour for Social Security
Syndicates have regreted that low salaries workers are punished with a reception generated by others, and they warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will increase about three billion dollars per year, has encouraged the company community, which is a tax for employment, when the focus should be in economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those winning more than 200,000 £ per year, will affect approximately 10 million employees.
CLASSES CLASSES OF THE INFORM OF THE PRODUCT
Social security with an additional increase of 0,5 % from April 2011
Economy will be over 4,75 % expected this year
New 50 % tax on bankers' bonds
The amount of 1 point of the tax on small signatures was dismissed
Tax decreases for cars and wind turbines
Stabil pension would increase 2,5 %
The estimates of the Department of Hacienda are estimated, a person wins £30,000 £90 per year and who wins £40,000 £190, while a person wins £10,000 per year will win £110.
The ministers said that their objective to reduce the deficit for 2013 was "successful decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax charge would be over 5% of the highest salaries.
The Ministry of Hacienda, Stephen Timms, refused that tax expenditures and declined expenditures were a "bane grain in the wilderness" compared to what was needed.
"These are large numbers. It will allow us to reduce deficit to half, which is absolutely essential during the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he had confidence that the economy would grow again to the end of the year.
However, the prognoses of the laborist party concerning the future economic growth, which will affect the quantity to be requested and the speed to reduce deficit, have been doubted after the Ministry of Hacienda has seen obligated to change the first numbers.
In its statement, he suggested that the economy would probably be at 4,75% this year, much worse than the decrease of 3,5% pronosti· in April, while the request for loans would be £3 billion over the estimated estimated.
"Unexpected opportunity"
The Conservators, who will launch a new public campaign on Thursday, warning about "the debt crisis" of the laborist party, said that the projection of loans for $789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a believed plan on the way they would deal with the money, adding "cinically" the difficult options until the elections to be carried out in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," the Minister said in the shadow of the Ministry of Hacienda, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and have disappointed it."
"All important announcements will be made after elections, wins who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The workshop insists that schools, hospitals and the police of future debt will be protected, in contrast with the proposals of conservas, which would seek a higher deficit reduction to shorter period.
However, the democratic liberals have said that the money covered by tax increases and expenditure costs would be used to support the costs of the next year, not to reduce deficit, argumenting that the projects were as "bane castilloes".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for announcements, as the increase in the inflation of some subsidies by incapacity of the next April, mentioned earlier, would leave the Minister of Affairs expressed to electoral manner accusations, since the money could only be recovered in the next year.
However, the laborist party insists that it is more needed to the people and that the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"Pressure"
Although the ministers did not publish the cost data later than 2011, the economicists said that it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be made for a medium-term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the numbers of the Ministry of Hacienda included substantive recovery in many areas, potentially including transport, high education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really putting the pain forward," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important announcements will come after the election, win anyone you win," added Roger Bootle, the economic advisor of Deloitte counters.
"This has been the previous report of the budget. The markets are taken into account."
The FBI investigates the "retentions of and detentions in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five men and suspicious of extremist connections.
The Pacific ambassador said to the BBC that men were arrested in a house in Sarghoda, in the east province of Punjab.
The FBI said he was investigating if they were the same men who disappeared from their homes in Virginia, USA, last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the United States said that he was also looking for information on men.
It is informed that three of them are of Pakistanian seed, one of Egypt's inheritance and the other of Jemen.
"If they are northern American citizens, of course, we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are keeping," said the carrier, Ian Kelly.
The FBI carrier, Katherine Schweit, said that the agency was in knowledge of arrests and was in contact with the families of disappeared students.
"We are working with the Pakistan authorities to determine their identity and nature of their business there, if these are actually the students who were disappeared," said the carrier.
The Embajada Pakistanian in Washington said the men were arrested in a house that belongs to the boy of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the view of the local police and that there were no charges against the prisoners yet.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Clinton, refused to make comments on arrests, informed the Agency of News Re—s; but he said that the U.S. had to "work closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recrutate and train people".
The families of the five students announced their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
International Amnistia condamn "Abuses" Iranian
Human rights in Iran have always been equal to deficiencies during the last 20 years, a report of the International Amnistia campaign.
The report describes "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man mentioned in the report said they had hit him and burned him with cigarettes. Other said they threatened him to violate him.
Iran has criticized its history of human rights.
The officers have said that such criticisms have a political foundation.
Thousands of persons arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election made by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused greater travel protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Twelve people have been condemned, and taxes have been sentenced at least five persons to death.
The representative of the BBC in Teheran, Jon Leyne, now located in London, says that during the protests, the Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, recognised some abuse accusations, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak arrest centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to critics, if our responsibilities are.
False confession
Amnistia International cited the report of Abraham Mehtari, a 26-year-old informatic student, who assured that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the result of elections.
"They often shoot me in the face" is their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes below the eyes, on the head, on the head,... they dressed me with execution and humiliated me."
Amnistia said that after five days, she signed a confession and left it and left the street, still bloody and semiconscient.
In August, the destroyed presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some manifestants arrested after the election had been tortured until death in prison, and others were violated.
The Iranian officers rejected violation accusations, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnistia also quoted the case of an ex-pension, who suggested that it was in a container with 75 people for more than eight weeks, in a prison center in Kahrizak.
Amnistia recognized that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authority had established committees to investigate the post-elect and response of the Government, but he said that the mandate and powers of the bodies were confused and that notices of the parliamentary committee were not public.
The group said at least 90 people have been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent more manifestations.
A trace of ski was made in the city's park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol interest site into a competition track.
The track in the park event attracted 16 semi-profesional snowboarders and snowboarders who competed for effective premiums.
At the top of the spring at the Brandon Hill park, there was a short spring box, before a trace of 100 meters of length.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was very scared.
It looks under a beautiful view of the town's lights titeling.
Here are some of the best snowboarders and snowboarders in the condate, true talent," he added.
The premises were delivered to the best trucks or hands performed in the track.
After the evening of Thursday's afternoon, the snow will be lost.
Still they and we
Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laico State.
In a time when its voters have requested to prohibit the construction of minerals and that there is a generalised warning on the proposed islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a northern American academic, wrote a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of the Muslims (which actually is integrating) in one of the most openly lac societys of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirators of the last work of the author "Why French don't like the vials" ("Why the French Don't Like Headcarves") (2006), a elegant and detailed study of a problem that he split and cared for the country during a deep and medium, and whose effects are still understood today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has a broader and ambitionary perspective.
As a good antropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has spent months in mixtures, schools and institutions that now provide 5-6 million Muslims in France, which Mr. Bowen calls "islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who plays debates between teachers and students on the questions they are more interested.
Would a muslim should marry in a mixture or at a meeting (or both)?
Should young Muslims teach them about homosexual development and rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-muslimian man?
Is it lawful that a Muslim uses a system based on interests to obtain a hypoteca?
These are apparently worldwide issues, supporting, daily life things, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of pictures, teachers and intellectuals, none of them of rename, with the possibility of Tariq Ramadán, a academic and learned Arab Muslim, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern Lac society.
They can't distribute this argument completely.
Conservers doubt the idea of a French or European islam.
The thoughts and activists that Mr. Bowen's interview are tending to be in concord with his gentlemen of Salafi, Sunni Islam purist partyers associated with Saudi Arabia, who now have a small but influent presence among the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French laicism could be compatible.
But the adjustment repeats mutual concessions.
Ask how far the French political strategies (and the intellectual elite that so ferozly defeats laicism) are really committed with pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims may have a more injustice treaty than the Catholic, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make their historical commitments with Lac Republicanism.
More than a growing pragmaticism, it feels "a value adjustment".
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say, "Yes, but not yet."

Even at the present, zoologic recints are usually a million of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never suitable: a green pool coast in Singapore was put by the algas growing within the areas of a no hair of its powder.

Ellis recalls reports of other writers and historians, and often turns back to the threat that the chassiers present to the superespecies.
Although it is held in Norway, the United States and Russia, the murder continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter chasers and squimical Indians in mototives use high-power asylum fusils to break their prisons.
Ironically, it is in the waters towards the north of those two cazing nations where ice will be for more time.
In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, an ancient editor of New Scientist, provides a clear and scattering report on the science of the Arctic and a supercoge looked at how to transform the future of that place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Not atmosphere or oceanographic scientists can explain the speed of changes properly.
It's not for the lack of emphasis.
Fridtjof Nansen's pillary journeys at the end of the 19th century and the principles of the 20th century were given for the first time indications about the movement of ice masses.
Then the cold war's submarinos brought a map of the ice corners that were under ice mass.
Satellite explosions and the series of icebergs mounted songs are a useful complement, but residents in the cold are still performing many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, lower world of the inflammable system within the ice ice, formed by salin water flowers that are compressed while he is frozen.
But from the beach on the surface to the microscopic miracles inside, they are all condemned once the ice of the soil goes away, what you think can happen at some time between 2013 and 2050.

Marines between 6.000 who put crowns in Arlington's tubs
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours in bus to put a single crown on the tube of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, N.C., to the National Cementary of Arlington to decorate tubs, it was a day to deal with men and women who once stood in their boats.
In a few months, from where we are shiping, these could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we are, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered the Sabbath on the morning to place crowns in the veteran tubes in several sections of the Arlington Cementary.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Coronas Worcester Company in Harrington, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundreds of tubs in the Arlington Cementary.
In what is a 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife, Karen, are going to travel every year in different cities throughout the road, to office events dedicated to military and terrorism victims.
The Worcester also found an unfinished organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 coroners in the Arlington Cementary Tubes, areas in the Pentagon, tubs in the National Cementary of Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in the city of New York and on the memorandum site by the Vuelo 93 of the United Airlines in Shanksville, Pensilvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said he did the journey to Arlington in honor to her husband, a carrying military deceit.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was her way to give a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modesty way that civilians can support our groups, he's deceived.
It's like visiting a family tub.
Enveloped in calm clothes, volunteers walked to Â of the wide pigs and mountains of the cementary.
The volunteers were guided to older tubs of the First World War, the Second World War, and the Vietnam war, because they did not receive so many visits as new tubes, they told the organizationers.
The atmosphere was glad when children were playing and the couples took their hands, while wearing the fresh pine to the buried lamps.
Each crown was of a deep green, with a small red lake attached to the top.
Nearly there, section 60, where most of the veterinarians of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained still in silence.
The United Service Organizations (Association pro the soldier) gave 1.000 coroners to decorate the section, but the shadow atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others reaped, and families and friends were supported in the glacial air.
Some read in a loud voice names split in the stones, while others inclinated to see small white and black plates placed in the mined bar, for those whose lamps have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who played the lips of their eyes before his son's tub.
He spent eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tube of the Sgto marine artiller. David Shane Spicer, who died in the fight in July.
No one should ever give up why we are free. . . My son paid for that, he said.
"Too long after my death, I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officers arrested a Government contractor and
The Cuban government arrested a government contractor and distributed mobile and computer computers in the country, the officers of the State Department held on the Sabbath.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for development Alternatives Inc, with seat in Bethesda.
The company works in projects for customers such as the International Development Agency of the United States and the World Bank.
Consular officers, together with the United States Interest Section in La Habana, are searching for the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban Law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested by almost anything that is considered "of danger".
All activities called contra-revolutional activities, including light and critical protests, include the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graphs and talks are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, addressed by the popular commenter Yoani Sánchez, which often writes about how she and her husband are followed and accused of government agents.
Sánchez has requested in several opportunities to leave the country to accept premises, but the permission has been rejected.
The detention of a contractual and ability may probably cause tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the administration of Obama, which has been looking for a closer "late ritme" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to meet the news of the arrest on Thursday night.
The new policy and stress that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisons and the creation of most space for opposition, there will be mutual proximity from the United States.
Mobile and computers are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coded products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; they are used in particular for text messages, since a telephone conversation of 15 minutes would cost the daily salary.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in dear hotels and for foreign visitors in the hotel, and in some establishment of the government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The arrest of a e in Cuba is inu.
Gloria Berbena, official of pressure in the United States Interest Section in La Habana, said that most of the citizens and prisoners in Cuba are among crime reactions such as drug traffic.
Berbena said he couldn't provide more information about arrest.
The arrest and arrest are clearly uncertain.
A activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as distributing free mobile mobile, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the United States Programme of Human Rights Watch, which recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba", a reference to Raul Castro as leader of the country, to submit to its "great brother Fidel".
Vivanco said that the accused ones are often arrested, processed and in prison in one day.
He showed that any solution would be probably political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when both countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistanian functioners design a complot to send men to Afghanistan
On the Sabbath, the Pakistanian authorities neutralised the present brain of a complot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill troops and groups, demonstrating that they hope that the case can help to discontinue a network of terrorist recrutators, who resort to the Internet for radicalized young people.
Researchers said that they were following a mysterious insurance figure known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments accepting terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah guided the men once they were in Pakistan, helping them reach the remote area in the Pakistan tribe, which is a family place for Qaeda and their terrorist training fields.
But a Pakistanian intellectual officer who had been informed about the case showed the Sabbath that Saifullah could not convince the commanders of Al Qaeda that men were not part of a complex of the → to infiltrate into the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the East town of Sargodha, far from the imponents of the northwest mountains, who have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of an operation in ́erta.
For this reason, the officer, who spoke from the anonimated due to the delicateness of the case, was devoted.
The officer said that men were not immutated and were even trying to gain the appropriate approval for the fields of Al Qaeda, when the Pakistanian police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are inquired by the FBI, subscribes the critical role of the recruters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps, what is most important, determine who are confidential.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, intellectuality and § have set the main priority for infiltrating people within the Qaeda.
The reclusors of the organization act as guards, not allowing those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the Holy War, and those who could be spies.
The analystes said that the Qaeda is particularly careful for American aspiring recrutes.
But for the organization, they represent a huge attractive, because of their potential to have access to objectives and abilities and because of their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analysis for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also been more careful in recent years for those who admit, because the intellectual and Property agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way is it to follow the model of recruitment how much have they been followed? showed Kohlmann.
It has been transformed into a model based much more on the web.
Decades of thousands of protests in Copenhagen, requires "action"
The Sabbath decades of thousands of manifestants went here through the streets by negotiators working at the Convention Centre of Bella Centers of the city, more adequate action for the climate.
The demonstrators said that 1000,000 people participated in the event, but the police considered that the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was pac, although a masked activist put small explosives near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
In a day in which it was shortly in the conversations on the climate patrocinated by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city by supporting pancarts in English saying, "No planet B" and one in Spanish he declared, "The Earth says "yes enough".
A number of famous people joined the protest, even the Danish and the model Helena Christiansen, who said that Peru, his mother's birthal country, had made me aware of the troubled issues with which the country should lead due to the impacts of climate changes that are already going on. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join the great manifestation, to spread the word and call the leaders of the world, to present a righteous, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not a easy job, but it must be done, there's no way to excite it for more time.
The police prevented the demonstrators too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or by carrying bottles.
In accordance with the Danish law, those activities are held during manifestations.
It is a test, which was requested not to be identified by being involved in the climate conversations, a sports and black masks activists placed several explosives near Copenhagen's main channel, which is near several ministerials.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as called, but they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
In the center of conventions, people gathered around the television screens to look at the walk throughout the afternoon.
But the protest seemed not to penetrate the consciousness of key officers such as Your Wei, China's head of climate negotiator.
When he was asked if he thought that the manifestation had a constructive impact on international resolutions, he answered in English, "I wasn't really as much as the situation."
Then he continued to say in mandarin, "as the place of a large place, I can't hear what happens outside."
He indicated that it depended on the perspective of each person to define whether the course was injury or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the public in general and different sectors on the subject of climate change.
On the other hand, "you can also say that negotiations are affected, or the freedom of other people.
A test data discover persistent racial differences
The Federal Book of Qualifications last week on Mathematical performance was a very good news for the public schools of the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the systems with better performance in the country, the book of qualifications showed that the fourth and eighth degree students had given a faster time during the last two years, regarding the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains in the recent numbers of the National Evaluation of Education Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African students and white students, both locally and at national level.
The average scores of white students in the fourth degree of D.C. during the last two years increased from 262 to 270 (in a scale of 500), but their African couples only increased three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the difference in performance increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Africans in the eighth degree remained essentially fixed, laying down an insignificant point statistically from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the results of the test, because the size of the sample was not very large.
During a six-year period, the table is no longer highlighting.
The difference that separated the white and black students of fourth degree in 2003, when the first ENPE was known in the District, was from 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some educational lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, since the advances held by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Master Adrian M. Fenty (Democrate) were mostly impulsed by white students, which are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the joint by making those at the top of the scale, which is difficult and conflictuous, Jeffith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-good organisation which is aware of educational balance in the District.
I don't give joy for a difference of two or three points, said the member of the Council of the D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-For acumulation), who has a daughter at the fourth degree of the Eaton Elemental.
Brown, an asylum critical of Rhee's administration style, said that the message of the test pointing is that the secondary schools of the city have an unexpected need of attention .
They always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But the concern is that we don't dedicate neither time nor energy necessary for our average schools.
Rhee said that the District needs to continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the students of low performance.
This holiday, for example, is training some teachers to use a new reading course, the Wilson Reading System, directed to students of the higher levels of the primary and medium school, which did not dominate the early reading foundations in their school courses and are considered behind their parents.
The matematics of every day, a matematic curriculum from Kindergarten to six degrees, which highlights games and experiences of real life, which was introduced in the District under the former supervisor Clifford Janey, which believes something about the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we need to continue working to offer the best interventions to those students who are under the level, Rhee showed.
Others say that the results of the ENPE are the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the general performance of the system and even provide additional money and resources for low performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here is a species of disastrous dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studied town test scores.
The solution of the Conventional Policy is to address its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
The objective can then generate political impacts against that important cronogramme.
But the problem, of course, is that, as other citizens overcome, it is trying to get to the white and black average class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build an excellent school system.
We need to strengthen our barriary schools, so all families, without taking into account where they live, have confidence that their children can be a excellent public education.
Janey, now a supervisor of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end with the difference of performance is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to competite with self-schools.
It has to come to almost 200 days to have the strength of the change, Janey said, that has come to an agreement with his teachers' syndicate last year in a year of 185 days, which considers a "a" "a" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Make the higher education a part of more future
The tourist bus came to the Gettysburg University with a strong resort.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descended and parpaded for a moment in front of the white columns, the fabrics of ladrillos and the smeral pigs.
Graciela's parents had only graduated in a secondary school of El Salvador.
Even a few years ago, Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never put a feet in a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth-party students exploded Gettysburg, where the matrix costs $38.690 per year, her was less than the invited students than the potential student enthusiasm.
Yes! Here is where I will be! Greciela, who would like to study medical, when the leader announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, really? said thoughtfully, when the leader talked about the low proportion of students in the school.
The Pennsylvania University was the seventh that children had visited at their trip of three days, and had already absorbed completely their deliberated message: The question is not whether you're going to the university.
The question is what.
Although there is growing concern for the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who leave the secondary school or who are pregnant in adultery, there are also hundreds of thousands who access to university education that needs for the average class.
In fact, one of each five of these Spanish "of second generation" is graduated at the university, a wonderful achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially mexican and center-American, entered into the United States without finishing the secondary school.
Their success stories are important, researchers, because they indicate the way to follow a generation that will play a role of great importance in the work force of the country.
Those who analyze higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and an intimate trend to succeed.
Many parents also have high objectives for their children and find ways to compensate their family failure with schools and schools.
But protective programmes can also play a role in helping Graciela and millions of children like it to reach the university, especially if efforts are supported at time.
In view of children of low income, whose parents do not have experience and ability to help them navigate through the system, it is deducted that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a research from the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We need to think of providing a support network for these children, from the infant garden to the secondary school.
The federal programme that financed the tour for Graciela universities is an excellent example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than 300 million dollars per year to local school systems, to implement university preparation programmes, which start when low income students are at the average school and continue until the secondary school ends.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent of the university, is the United States Education Department.
The Ministry of the Iraqic Petroleum reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companys
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqian government has reached important oil companys to rebuild their infra-face fragil during two sub-situations that ended the Sabbath.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqian Petroleum Minister alcan’s with foreign oil company suggest that China, Russia and European petroleum companies are prepared to play a main role in the restoration of the Iraq oil industry, muti · de de wars and sanctions.
Companys and companies have been remotely raised in only two of the 10 substantive yields.
Seven companies and companies were paid to participate in the second substance, which eat on Friday.
The only one that presented a offer was lost.
Two companys and companies have reached agreements for awards in June.
The poor representation of oil and oil gigantes in the opening of the Oil industry of Iraq was obvious to the analystes.
Iraq finally opened his doors after six years of war, and instead of companys and companies, there are Asian and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Petroleum Forum, a online news centre.
It'll pass a long time before something else is offered in Iraq.
Safety concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombs on Thursday, and political instability while military and assets turn away, probably prevented oil companys and risks more energyly in Iraq, which has the third most important reserve of cruse in the world, have analyses.
Companys and assets were in some cases in disappointment, since rivals, in particular Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the Government, have less work costs and are more intended to take risks because they do not respond to the employees.
Exxon-Mobil and O日al Petroleum Inc were the only companys and companies that reached agreements with the Ministry.
The main signatures and signatures, such as Chevron and ConocoPhiʹps, which have been linked to the Iraqic Ministry of Petroleum and have provided technical advice in recent years, have been removed with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts granted this weekend.
The National Corporation of Petroleo, the property of the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and gained large investments in contracts for two main resources.
We know that China is in the way to become a main economic and technological power, showed the portfolio of the Ministry of Petroleum Assam Jihad.
We have confidence that the Chinese company will be at the couple of its competitors and will comply with its commitments to Iraq.
The pre-selected companies for proposals made offers that later were confronted with the subvention by barryl that the minister was willing to pay to increase the production above the current levels of each juice.
The main al Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan
It is believed that a suspicious attack in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a main operating planner in Qaeda this week, said the officers of the contraterrorism and officials on Wednesday.
If it was confirmed, this would be the second death attack against a high-range terrorist leader this hot.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabian men who thought that it had failed on Tuesday when a couple of missiles affected their car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the North Waziristan province, were sources and Pakistanians and officers of the region.
The local authorities said that the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by 日 within the illegal tribe area of Pakistan.
They were running a white car, directly to the Afghanistan border, when the car received the impact, a civil intellectual agency of Pakistan said, speaking on a phone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the suspicious local military soldiers were predicted to the place and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely destructed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to verify the identities of victims, but two officers of the counter terroristism and two men men mentioned unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
It was described to Somali as a military planner of high rango from Al Qaeda, which led operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was dedicated to conspire throughout the world, said a high officer, who spoke from the anonimate, quoting the delicate nature of air and air attacks within the Pakistanian territory.
In view of its central role, this has probably included conspirative attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide of the superior command of the Qaeda and translated it into operational patrons for potential terrorist attacks.
The second officer said that Somali had quickly ascended into the rows of Al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups of the region.
It may not be a known name for some, but it doesn't reduce anyway the threat that has planted us and our associates, the second officer was deceived.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of the Qaeda or the Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Namuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military faction in the tribe area, and three other high rango agents.
The rate of non-piloted aircraft attacks guided by Â has decreased since the soil, from a average of approximately six operations per month to two, is a record of The Long War Journal, a website addressed by a non-animated organization.
The reduction may be to a tactic improved by the terrorist groups, which have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while they are unexpectedly murdered to suspicious informants, has deployed the site.
Maximum sent from the United Nations to Kabul to reject
The maximum sent by the United Nations to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Wednesday that he would reject his post in March, completed with a tumultuous mandate that was seen injured by corruption accusations extended in the presidential election of Afghanistan supported by the United Nations.
The Eide output occurs when Obama administration has decided to send approximately 30,000 groups and additional responsibility to Afghanistan.
The United Nations sentence said that it supports the increase, but he is concerned that the cronogramme and Property for the military retirement beginning in 18 months encourages other governments from the NATO to remove its forces.
We have to accelerate the preparation of Afghanistan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghanistan to trust in the international community, Eide noted in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomatic also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, cooperating with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civil sector, aborted.
Eide said he was not released, but simply fulfilling a promise that he made to his family in March 2008, that he was only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it's better to start looking for a successor, Eide showed it.
When I came here, there was a two-month empty between the outcome of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started searching for a replacement, if the United Nations officers.
The officers say that they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently directed the United Nations mission in Bagdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously directed United Nations peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegated Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September to promote President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote of the country and to cover evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide refused the invoices, but he said that Galbraith's accusations, who was dismissed, "surely hurt the mission, because there was a lot of scepticism on international interference" in the election.
Eide said that he proposed the designation of a high civil representative to coordinate the efforts to assist by the forces carried out by the United States in Afghanistan.
He also encouraged the United Nations leadership to allow its successor to contract more personally from the United States and other western countries, which are provided to the Afghanistan mission, and that this would increase their confidence in the use of their money correctly.
Eide expressed its frustration for limitations to its powers in Afghanistan, stressing that United Nations engaging regulations decline their ability to capture talents.
That is why the United Nations rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he showed it.
That's catastrophic and can't continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Defense Secretary, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "super significant sanctions" against Iran, because of its failure to introduce conversations on their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, leading to a group of approximately 300 groups and groups in the north of Iraq, during a trip of a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, in response to the question of a soldier on the probability of such an action.
One of the things that I am worried is that if we have done something from Iraq during the last six years, it is the inherent invisibleness of the war.
Obama administration considers a package of sanctions directed to Iran's military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
I understood that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and desincents", "to convince the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons", because "Your people will suffer greatly" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement of the Porter of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face "creasible consequences" if its nuclear programme does not completely respect the indications of the United Nations Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that he wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peace purposes.
In conversations in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would again negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would accept a substantial part of its rich uranio reservation, instead of the fuel that is unexpectedly required for a medical researcher.
The administration has pressed for that agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have removed from the tentative agreements, in part, experts, because the Iranian mandate is divided in relation to the possibility of compromise with the United States.
In fact, I believe that Iran's endurance with the international community on some proposals that were actually accepted at the beginning of October has joined the international community, including the Russian and Chinese, in a way that it has not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranian.
President Obama set as a date limited on 31 December to respond to the proposals, before other options were replanted, even to promote what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, called "devastating sanctions".
In a statement made in New York, Iran mission to the United Nations announced what the Thursday called "infunded and cruel accusations" from some members of the Security Council on nuclear activities of Iran, and said that he had the will to continue with the conversations with the United States and other five world powers, "to achieve a close, long-term solution."
Gates, who was going to return to Washington last Friday, was found tomorrow with the Iraq Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before he flew to the Kurd region of Iraq rich oil, to meet with groups in Kirkuk and Kurd officers in Irbil.
Strengthening continues to be high between Kurds and the majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in the United States projects, to reduce the number of groups and groups from 115.000 to 50,000 to the end of August.
Gates also tried to relieve the Kurdic concern on declining. The officers and officers cited the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, the President of the Regional Government of the Kurdist: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and self-sufficiency within an unified Iraq.
We will not leave them."
In a ageing China, a change of rumor
Wang Weijia and her husband grew around by propaganda cards that were talking to them about the fact that "the Mother of Earth is too comfortable to support more children" and "a baby but means a more tube."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shangai's Government officers, alarmed by the underborn birth and the older people of their city, immediately changed this summer and began to invoke young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We've already given all our time and energy for only a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31 years old, a human resource administrator with a 8-month son.
More than 30 years after a single child's policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notorially admired children, unbelieved unbelieved children, appealingly "small emperors", is a demography crisis in the country.
The average birthday is fallen to 1,8 children per couple, compared to the six of when the policy has been effective, if the Division
Demography of the United Nations, while the number of residents of 60 years and more will exploit from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent to 2050. This is very above the average average of approximately 20 per cent.
The unbalance is worse in the rich coast cities with very worshipped populations, such as Shangai.
Last year, the people of 60 years and more accountable are almost 22 per cent of Shangai's registered residents, while the birthday was less than a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Committee on Family Planning and Municipal Population in Shangai, has shown that feeding couples should have children to "help to reduce the proportion of the older population and to attain a future lack of work."
Shangai is going to be "an old (not so rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Switzerland," he aborted.
A gradual alivio
In the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single son of China may be the most polemic mandate introduced by the Communist Party until the date.
Parents who violate the policy are faced with a huge burden, even three times their annual dilution in some areas, and working discrimination.
Chinese officers have assessed the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denied abuse in the imposing policy.
In rural areas, some officers have committed women pregnant with a second child to be subject to abortions.
Moreover, many couples have made aborts are the sex of the fat, leading to a high inatural proportion of women.
In recent years, demographic officers have gradually declined their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more oppositions to the rule, including urban residents, ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and women are unique children, and in 2007 many of their hard-line limbs were affected.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the Demography Research Institute of the University of Peking, said that the officers of the Central Government have recently discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the marriages is a unique son.
In July, Shangai became the first Chinese city in launching an aggressive campaign for more births.
Nearly the evening tomorrow, the cartels that ordered the families to have one son were substituted by copys of legislation that describe who would be nice to have a second son and how to ask for permission.
The Government of the city sent family and voluntary planning officers to visit couples in their homes and slipped brochures below the doors.
He also promised to provide emotional and financial orientation to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officers say that the answer has been very little abusive.
Deceptive Reply
Although the officers of a rural city outside Shangai stressed that they observed a moderate increase in the requests of couples that wished a second child after the campaign's employment, the most citizens do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115.000, is still receiving from four to five requests per month.
Shangai's disappointed officers say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach about 165.000, lower than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu family planning committee in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason for which many people do not want more children.
They want to give the best to their first son, he's disappointed.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, of 26, said that they would like to have two children and are legally enabled to do so.
But as many Chinese, they have only an insufficient medical and life insurance that the government provides to them.
Without a social protection network, they support that option would be unresponsible.
Western people wrongly see the unique child policy as a question of rights, said Yang, an engineer of the building whose wife is pregnant for seven months of the first child of the couple.
Yes, they're stealing us the possibility of having more than a child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resource manager, said he wanted a single child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to take care of us all.
We are not used to take care of others and we really don't want to care about others. "
Chen Seiian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it in a more consistent way.
For parents with two carriers, of a medium class, who reduce the birth of birth, it was to have enough success as to be egoists.
People from between 20 and 30 growing in the fight of their parents during the first days of China's experience with capitalism and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, she manifested.
Even one only boy reacts a long time from parents, sustened.
One mother has to reject at least two years of his social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remove their apartment," and the strategy "he must have a course prepared for the best guards when the child has nine months."
Most of your friends are ready to do this once, said Chen, but not two.
Our is the first generation with the highest level of life, she manifested.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the United Nations has a plan to reduce the reductions
The Conference on the climate patrocinated by the United Nations, characterized up to now by challenged positions and mutual rehabilitations, took a renewable attention on Thursday with the interpretation of a document which provides ambitious reductions of the inver-effect gas during the next 40 years, with industrialized nations that carry on their homes most of the load in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate inver-effective gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and stressed the way to follow.
But it was seen as an important progress in a negotiation that remains untimely, with more than 100 world leaders who will come to Copenhagen next week.
A United Nations ad hoc working group does not refer to how much money the poor countries would give to the poor to the global short and long-term calamity.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economys and the main emergency economys would cover their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in the temperature that political strategies would be willing tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited the document of six pages, summarized a 180-page negotiation text to concentrate on what the maximum climate officer of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great panorama".
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collect their performances for 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce their levels during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Jointly, the countries would cover between 50 and 95 per cent to 2050.
The European Union also estimated discussions on Thursday, promised to provide $3,600 million for the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from inundations and drought to deforestation.
On Wednesday, in all ways, it was the same type of verbal artificial fires that have dominated the conversations last week.
The special climate sentence of the United States, Todd Stern, 日 the obligations requesting obliged inver-effective gas coverages to industrialized countries, compared to the volunteers of the main emergency economy if they were not financed by the developed world.
The maniobra indicated that Obama administration has adopted a stronger line with China, regarding what the Bush administration officers did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the main developing countries to progress and take measures, she also showed that the text did not suffice to ensure that recourse could be verified by external observators.
Staren made its comments one hour after the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry He Yafei, that the maximum climate negotiator in the United States had a "common feeling" or was "very unresponsible" because he said before the week that the United States would not help China economically with the global recalling.
With the future economic traictory of the main powers of the world in the game, falling lines have made both in the world in developing ways and between the industrial world and the emergency economy.
The current battle is so much to save individual economics and to save the planet, with China and the United States, are on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influent countries of the world ignore the impertitive science to take the strongest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main potential are discussing who should cost the costs to limit the inver-effective gases, even when vulnerable countries have been more aggressive to seek to contain the major responsibility of their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemonia is developed, Ulate, who also works as regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries on the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that the discussions would make a political agreement.
The Small Insular States Alianza, accounting of 43 members, prepared a proposal for preliminary treaty of 24 pages early on Friday morning.
Arthurge-Metzger, who includes international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the empire of the small island nations has "increased political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now united and requires the action of emergency economys such as China and India.
The discussions took a new emergency while the delegates focused on the fact that they should solve the majority of the issues before the Governing Boss had concluded a negotiation.
High-level officers, such as the Indian Ministry of Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Minister, came down from the aircraft and run to the Bella Center's pairs, to meetings at closed doors and press conferences, to be able to degradate the claims that will be arbitrated for the next week.
The absolute disorder of the Property (which every day 13,000 people come and go out of the centre of the Convention, the activists to the guitarra present Burland-Nighted spectacles of the countries they are selling, and the preliminary proposals are made in hand instead of mail) are a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and the midnight 60 government heads are in Copenhagen.
Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, President of the Global Conservation Policy, said that we are in the older links.
Hard weights are coming.
The first train at 225 km from Great Britain refines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 on Monday morning, a silver will perforate the darkness to indicate a train output that marks a revolution for traveling in Great Britain.
The first high-speed train of the country will reach the 225 kmh when it passes as a radius from Ashford, Kent, to the St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on the border of the first interurban service Javelin outside London.
He expects the new service to finally connect to British to a international network of fast, confidential trains and connect the large concurrences of the Midlands, the North and London.
The disadvantaged areas would be made in suburbs, business travel time would be shortened and the change of aircraft and cars to railway would reduce the national car rentals, as well as the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the decades of thousands of millions of litres that are needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fear of environmental damage can still break up the high-speed lines of Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government a traveling study, will give its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, assumed by the Times.
This will provide you a detailed ittary of the next planned stage for high speed network.
The new line that London at the Midlands of Western will be drawn within a five-meter radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be polemic.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radio of 25 meters of a definitive road.
HS2 also is expected to set three options for a higher speed network than the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in primavery.
The preferred option to be proposed is a Y-form configuration, in which one high speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided in or nearby Birmingham, with a branch leading to the west from the Peninsulas to Manchester and Propertyia, and another to the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
Only one line would enter into ́s.
"It seems to be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tram, which would not be invoked before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a little more than one current hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 km, converting to the British network to the fastest Europe.
The initial road is designed to support trains of 400 mt length, transporting 1.100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a line of London-Birmingham.
This means that a London terminal would be needed to receive 200,000 passengers per hour.
In view of capital space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be extended to the high speed network.
Railway industry experts suggest that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes that the scheme should be conducted, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until a general election.
Even if the work is running, the network should be built in sections.
At the beginning, trains would have to leave the fast lines by the carriers on the north of Birmingham, maintaining the travel time between London and Â¡s over the three hours.
This is considered the crucial point necessary to ensure a change in train aircraft, a reference point for railway revolution.
The contributors are with the hypoteque by a £75,000 £75,000 of a Conserver
Alan Duncan, the voter of the Conservator Party, covered the contributor thousands of pounds per year for the cost of a narrangal that built in the house of his electoral halt.
The voter of appeals in the party, which was degraded by David Cameron because of the "rations" of the lawyers, increased their hypoteca in £75,000 to build an enmar’s enrollion in his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the contributor to load the additional interest, summing hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the Communities Chamber adopted the applications at their time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Leg, who conducts a review of the expenditure of the members.
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of the Parliament, puts a two-site house in a city in its electoral hold of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for almost a million litres.
The low plant includes a kitchen, a room of stay and eating, but the office of honoraries agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added an inverro to the house, described in the plans as a "nacional".
The neighbors described it as "a winter for entertainment".
Mr Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent investigation of the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the Communities Chamber on its previous hypotechnical agreements.
Last month, the Committee decided to violate the rules after an investigation of its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for 27406 litres of his property from London to the house of his electoral employment, which he had bought in 1991, in the previous year to become a deputy.
The documents distributed this week show that Mr Duncan was requesting approximately 1,400 litres men in hypotechnical interests until March last year.
In April, their requests increased to more than £800 per month.
The type of interest of Mr Duncan's Real Bank's reality bank did not change at that moment, suggesting that all increases would be financed by 75,000 litres.
The standard BRE's different type of hypotechnical was decreased by 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the type which is now located.
The recent document issued by the Common Chamber Authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to request £50 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his work as President of the opposite of the Camera in September, after a reporter in ́erto filmed it saying that the lawyers had to survive after the expenditure scandal.
"In principle, this is nationalized, you have to live in races and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I take my money in my garden and ask a little fraction based on what is close.
And I could ask much more, but I don't. "
The lawyer, a millioner of his former profession as oil trademaker, was first questioned about its expenditure in May, when it resulted that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he agreed with the salaries office that this could be considered responsible.
A activist took a bullshit with the form of the symbol of the sterlin library in the protest of Mr. Duncan, after it was revealed that he requested 4000 litres for three years.
Last night, when they asked you about the increase of the hypoteque, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, both approved by the salaries office and later by the Law."
He added: "There is not to be disappointed and cursed or frozened by the rules or whatever is.
This is absolutely within the limits, the rules, authorised and all.
It couldn't be any more clear or simple way."

"The idea of the Palace Evening Calendar eats as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incrediblely creative and vibrant place, and we are trying to test and represent it to the spirituality."

About 30,000 people, the police; hundreds of thousands, organizers, were defiled by the Danish yellow capital in claim of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on climate change should reach later on Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Denmark President of the Climate Conference, the increased climate mobilization throughout the world, represented by these manifestations, contributed to "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents were shortly discovered after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all black clothing, broke out with dogs and martyrs, informed a journalist of the AFP.
The antidisturbing police interviews quickly and firmly.

Today, we took the streets to ask compensation for Southern debt, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine Military of the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhague.
We can't continue saying: There's a time, the Beninese song of Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that are sown, water courses that can be walked as never before.
For the first time in the history of the climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the antiglobalisation movement approached the organizations.
The French lawyer José Bø, the figure of antiglobalisation, explained that I came to Copenhagen to "unify climate justice and social justice": "The fight against global calamity is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The region of Asia, which gathers many very vulnerable islands to the calamity, gave the initial pointapie to the manifestations.
Organizators are held, about 50,000 people went out on the street.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, in their majority of students, they broke red clothes and stumbled with lamps for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, as well as in Canada, there were hundreds of demonstrants who claimed to act energyly against climate change.

This process is a stage of our new life, our new was as an independent state, declared to the AFP Svetlana Kvariae, a 54-year history, who had voted in Bagapch.
She was among the electors who were guided to the electoral table at a capital school, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palms in the entrance.

History and geographical allocation is strengthened from the reform of the secondary education, See Chatel
The National Education Minister, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be transmitted in the Saturday Information (JDD, is its French Section) that history and geographic would be "fortalecidas" from the reform of the general secondary education, despite being removed from the obligatorial education in the second year of cient bachillerate.
From now on, all students of the first bachillerate will have four weekly hours and the same programme for a common culture, Chatel.
For the Minister, "may with hypocrisy" is, therefore, "the branch C is no longer a cientical ram", but "in general, call the best students."
The branches General Teaching and Literary can't be subjected to C, subraying even: "and I didn't hear that historyers or intellectuals were angry because they had removed history and geographic in second bachillerate in the technological schools."
A IFOP study published on the Sabbath in the Humanity showed that approximately seven French ten (69 per cent) disapproval the Government project to remove the obligation of historical geographical teaching in second bachillerate C. Numbers of intellectual and teachers, left and some electoral representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister claimed "not speaking" to remove philosophy from the second bachillerate C programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of the educational training, while 16 organizations (studiers and syndicates) called on a day of mobilization on Thursday to protest against the project, which offers, if they, the pedagogical training of the future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, the Minister explained a test of admission to its discipline, and at the end of the year.
They will also do practices in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year before the school as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices before the concurrence, you will already have a great experience in front of the school, which is, more than 300 hours, he has aggregated.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in the National Education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Superior Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain climate evolution in a way convincedly.
Fifty minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Country, a challenge that he accepted the Sabbath morning, Jean Jouzel, President of the Intergovernmental Expert Group on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Northern Higher School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel of Peace, invoked the "Ernest" conference route, a day composed of a series of fifty-minute experts, filmed and opened to the public, informed a AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that touches people and gives them pleasure to know more, explained in the 22-year Conference of Edouard Hannezzo, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school stone.
We had some twenty participants among the experts of their discipline and chose them on their carism side.
About the global warming, "We can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," he said to the AFP Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphs before about fifty people.
It's part of our Scientific Role, it's highlighting that the public understands that "Copenhagen's conference is based on a very serious scientific issue".
Videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school website from 15 December.
For February, the next day "Ernest", followed by others to a bimestral ritme.
Return in payments: disturbance between prison guards, action is intended
The prison guard officers called on Friday to a "general mobilization" to pay the payment before the end of the year, the premiums and extra hours, which was placed up to budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Work Force (2th guards syndicate) requested the staff outside service to join the manifestation on Tuesday morning before the guards and "lock them" to declare that their hair's robe.
The Penitentiary CGT (3th syndicate of the profession) invites them to "reunion in General Assemblys in the various reasons to achieve a massive mobilization" because the "vergood and unacceptable" tissue of the payment in December of the "external hours, first nights, Sundays and feast days" worked in October.
And the first guards syndicate, the Federal Autonome Penitenciary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "convocate to general mobilization... in order to increase disappointment and fury".
The Penitentiary Director and the Ministry of Justice explain that extra hours increased much in 2009 and not all were accountable, but ensure that the salt will be approved in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Cancillery informed that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to guardians guarantee that the payment would be made next month.
No doubt of the efforts of the staff to work and modernize our penitential system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I requested the Penitentiary Director to implement immediately a set of measures aimed at that situation generated by a bad evaluation of the number of extra hours in the future.
The payment of December will then be lacked, except for the staff of the direction that enjoys the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and that "ever fails to the budgetary requirements," Ufap/Unsa deployed.
It's a real scandal, said an indignated interregional FO of Marsella, announcing its decision of boico—to the new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not work on Sundays and weeks, if the month of October is not paid in December, the same will happen with extra hours, also threaten FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time we increase the tasks and missions without taking more effective, it is more than regretable to attack the staff's salary, the CGT's penitenciary of Burdeos.
Syndicates are held, not in all regions, because some have more happier than others.

Euro-2009/Source: first title of Bousquet in its favorite distance
The French Fréderick Bousquet, a triple medalist in the Worlds-2009 long pool, received a international title in a distance where it feels particularly affected, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Stambul.
In the first day of this competition, where polyuretan batteries were allowed for the last time, only three records of the world were overwhelmed when they actually expected much more.
One was improved by Hungary Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian releval 4 x 50 m 4 styles (maculin).
A pen for Bousquet, which cooked the world record in 50 m free, marked in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal distants of the birth, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20''53 during the end, where ten natives were competited instead of eight, as usual, a primacy at international level.
Bousquet progressed to Croatia Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not get down the world mark (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always focus on something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world's record was at my disposal, I would get it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the senders were weakening polyuretan banners from 1 January.
These banners, originating 238 global records since February 2008, end their epopeia in Stambul, where they first competed for the same test in 1999.
This time the use of the banners didn't help German Paul Bi日mann, a double world campaign in the long pool this summer in Rome, consequent world records.
The young sealer did not get down his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glasner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up in this career.
I knew that this time I wouldn't be able to break a world record, but I could defend my title and fulfil my mission.
Lobintsev will be a heavy rival in the future, explained Bi日mann.

The life of the other wound, with the apparently vital organs, is dangerous.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a dismay and was internally "in shock state," she communicated a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, if it was a police source, would have escaped by the bowlman Jean Jaurès.
Apparently, it would have hurt two more peatons: a man of thirty years, and one of 40 seriously.
On the night, the crime scene was still unexplained.
He was armed with two carnizer bottles that were crossed in the street, explained at the place a responsible for the University of Alliance at the Highs of the Sena, Arnaud Presse.
Several transients, including young people, have controlled the injury, if the witnesses received by the AFP.
I saw a sort of about 30 years with a green cut.
Three young people tried to intercept it.

U.S.: the lawyer of Polanski asks again to disexamine the cause
The French-Polaco Chinese lawyer Roman Polanski recalled again this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western of the United States), which disappoints the cause against his customer, who is under home arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer of the Director of the Pianist, denied before three judges of the Appeal Chad of the Second District of California serious procedure errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that at the same time the charges are disapprovaled, since the court's conduct at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "is a scraping result."
If he was, judge Rittenband would have discussed with a tax that would have recommended that Roman Polanski had deserved to go to prison before he said judgment, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was published in the documental "Roman Polanski: wanted and wished" (Roman Polanski, searched and wished), from the mouth of the fiscal, David Wells.
But finally Wells said to the author of the documentary at the end of September "be lying."
Hummel claimed the conclusion of a sentence that would allow you to submit the evidence of its argument in the case of the Court to disapproval the case.
The accusation, from its part, repeated the argument expressed in the first instance, that no depreciation of the charges in Roman Polanski could be evaluated seriously was not presented before the court.
The cinemaist, of 76 years of age, fled from the United States in 1978 before his sentence was stated by " illegal sexual relations" with a less than 13 years old.
Since then, he never came to the United States again.
Phyllis Asayama, the district officer of Los Angeles, stated that Roman Polanski "he must be here to present himself in the audience."
For this reason, we want to transmit the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused ones, that there is a chance to flee?, asked Asayama.
For her, the cinemaist "demands a favor to the court, even though he has its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee.
Hummel was not the only one he asked to disapproval the cause against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
It suggests that your client no longer supports her every time he resurrects the case of Polanski, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was just.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by northern American arrest order.
After more than two months after the railways, he was condemned to home prison in Gstaad's cabin, waiting for an extra.

The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," is his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday " are very positive," he assured his son David on Friday when he came to the port of Los Angeles to join his hospitalized father since several days.
News are very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, declared to the press David Hallyday at the downstairs of the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after the 13-hours (21 h GMT).
The son of the song, disselfido, assured that he would be transferred to the Cedars-Sineai hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday by an infection resulting from the discal warning operation last 26 November in Paris.
The musician is "income induced from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid that he suffers and can so administrate his treatment," the pressing service indicated.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by the doctors of the Cedars-Sineai hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday by an infection, sequence of a discal warning operation on 26 November in Paris.
The song was operated once again on Wednesday evening due to serious lessions produced by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French school in Los Angeles, whose daughter Jade, to attend a school act, confirmed an AFP ́graph.
The Chief of Ortopædia and Traumatology of the Hospital of Pitié-Salpetrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel on Monday to Los Angeles to be at the song.
The manufacturer accused violently Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurocirurgian who operated to the song last 26 November in the international private clinic of the Monceau Park in Paris.
They told us that it was a massacre.
The chirurgians of Los Angeles said they were angry, said Camus.
It's talking about a possible request, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus suggested that Johnny Hallyday had "wayed too quickly to Los Angeles with the authorisation of the Parisian chirurg."
I talked directly to the doctor, and I was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem to travel, because I was operated twice in discal warmness, he grew up.
Shortly before in the RTL, he indicated that the song was likely "gone without canular, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very known in the art environment.
He operated the Marie Trintigant actriz in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux worked at that moment.
In 2007, he also interviewed Charlotte Gainsbourg actriz to reabsorb a hematoma formed by root of a brain hemorragie.
It is a doctor with bad reputation, condemned by justice in several times by mal practice, as well as by fiscal and staff fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "a man without slaves" requested "regularly" before the Order Council, and he is "leave to be recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "without any inconvenient" and that the results of postoperatory studies were "normal".
The operation " couldn't cause hemorragies and thus didn't need drenage," he appealed.
In any way, the tour of the song, whose health problems are multiplied since the soil, entered into a parentesis.
Without doubt, to repeat the turn on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as it was intended, I look very risked, said Camus.
The UDF association raised the tone and warned the New Centre on the use of its seal
The UDF association (Unium for the French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democracy Movement) of François Bayrou, repeated this Wednesday before the Chairman of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch a OPA (Public Adquisition Official) on the sequence of the former giscardist party, encouraged him to remove it from all support, unless requested.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to recover the UDF centuries, since he believed that François Bayrou was not in the position of defending his political inheritance after he had drawn his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Defence Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on the Sabbath before the National Council of the CN.
As support for its management, he received the aid of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who revinds the property of the UDF mark, since it was the first to register it in the National Industrial Propriété Institute in 2004.
But on Thursday night, the UDF association office, controlled by Friends of François Bayrou that they would not want private verses of this, breaked the silence to lay a request to the Minister and the lawyer intimate to refuse them to the centuries and to transfer the rights of the market's ownership, so that they were in the courtyard.
These last days, you have made many statements suggesting that you would propose your political movement to restore UDF, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Central Alianza.
They also believe that it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the +New center+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their military material and on the page of presentation of their site, support the signatures of the paper.
As they already know, they have no right to use the center, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to submit "the name of the UDF from all support, as well as of (su) website".
He also requests Hervé de Charrette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to the legal right-haviours".
If not, justice will be invited to make the law and law of the members of the UDF legally warned.
In the letter, they need that UDF "is a real political move since 1978" and they recall that Morin and his friends "selected" went in 2007 "to create a new game, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF sequence.
They also recall that the last UDF assembly voted in 2007 with its accession to the MoDem for three years and the establishment of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement based by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the office, "When he registered the mark", he was no longer "the member of the UDF since three years ago", but the UMP.
Uses scandally and fraudulently the UDF registration absence to perform it by its account.
This indiscretion is being transformed into crime, they claim, before being buried from the CN strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more dignified to make its own name than to get out of the anonimate by taking a name to which it is not right."

This means that in this case there will be a valuable process of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are disputed with the cosmetic empire L'Oreal.
But the Correctional Court No 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87, was subject to a medical examination of three medical professionals.
The Heritage and the Main Heritage of L'Oreal has always refused to submit these examinations, even in the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Fiscalia during the investigation.
The doctors designed this Wednesday shall provide a report before 10 March 2010 in which they should tell whether Liliane Bettencourt has suffered infirmity states and during which periods.
I think he'll accept it.
I'm going to talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, at the outcome of the audience.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was complained with the decision of the court.
It's a good news... The experience will show that he (Banier) manipulated this larger lady, to whom we should protect, was defeated.
Since two years ago, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt started criminal action against François-Marie Banier, a multifactic artist, accused him of having been used for years of his mother's weakness to obtain billions of euros in donations, through cheques, life security contracts or art works.
By its part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to have been manipulated by the ́grapher, which considers a long-date friend.
On Wednesday, while the court examined the proceedings of the action interacted by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers of the lawyers, in some cases, resulted in a great family confession.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that her customer would send to her notice (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which he said he disapproval of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, the lawyer was: "I could explain to my daughter I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifty years.
Since his wedding, I could never again talk to Françoise."
Once again, the Office of Nanterre considered that the applicant was not able to appear, as far as a judge of guards refused, in these last days, to make a place to his request to open a procedure of court protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "he has full capacity to appear before justice, he is not under protection and has no tutor.
Nobody else can appear in its place," said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be made once.
General Revolution or End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the large French companies, our fight for the development of business intellectuality would have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the leading of the large companies in respect of their employees recalls the position of the enterprises in relation to consumers before marketing revolution: it is that collaborators added to "values" specified from above as it was intended to impose consumers products thought by manufacturing techniques.
By putting the client in the centre of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to market conquist strategy... although the authoric trial to impose products that are not related to customers' preference factors is regularly repeated.
A demobilization of employees can end in a demoralization of mortality.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the point of iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affect executives.
This democracy commits seriously the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially the I+D and, even more, of business intellectuality.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all involved parties... have a proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; it requires a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of a copy direction.
For this reason, we invited a general revolution, which would consist of putting the partners in the centre of the company's concerns as the customer.
Internal opinion investigations have a relative utility
Will internal opinion investigations, such as the questionnaire made by Orange among its employees, encourage the genetic revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In the beginning, because I could check that, before a new situation, and after many holidays, all companies ended doing essentially... what they always did! B989
- Secondly, because the author, one of the pathology of power, increases proportionally the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most guidelines have a simple vision of human behavior.
As they come from the big engineer schools, they interpret psychology in mechanism.
They adopted, by intellectual comfort, the former conducting theory that "neurocides" and ́s recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and Media broadly distributed to their flocks.
In this way, suggesting that the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of executives can be handled, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr refines the guidelines in a mechanistic management position, unadaptated to the world today.
Determine and measure mobilization factors
In contrast, the general revolution needed for the good function of modern companies should be adopted a finalistic vision of human behaviour.
You have been able to integrate in any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for the employees, the commitment with the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make real part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies resulting from Motifuncial Analysis adopt this concept of the motivations of employees.
Studies showed that they judge their company based on a standard dock that allows them to evaluate what it offers to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and me of mobilization factors, companies' guidelines can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and rebuild human resource management "in the place".
In this way, they create a favourable area for organised development of strong and effective business intellectuality.
Oslo speaking: by the "righteous War" Obama receives age from the de
This Wednesday, the North American, satisfied that the Nobel Premium of the Peace 2009 had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, claimed the speech that Obama had spoken on Thursday.
The conservators, who had disapprovaled the delivery of the premium to Obama on 9 October, prepared this time the presidential talk as Sarah Palin, an ex candidate to the Presidency during the elections of 2008.
I loved what he said, declared Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the republican party's stage in the US Today magazine, and she appreciated that she had addressed the issue of the war "at times necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is since then the last thing northern Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
He's got to stop terrorists, he's noticed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, was dedicated, this Thursday in Oslo, to justificate the resource to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another opposer of Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the president had made "a very good work" in Oslo.
I think the talk was really very well, the former President of the House of Representatives, which particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At the moments, the talk looked very historical, Gingrich stated, during an interview in the "The Takeaway" radio program.
The former electoral representative, which some consider as a possible candidate to the Republican investment for the presidential elections of 2012, showed pleasure to listen to "a "left president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free or could give a peace premium if the resource to the force was not existing".
See Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's talks and current cronista in Washington Post, Obama called "a very northern American talk".
Besides being presented as "the world's citizen", as "ever doing it," "he spoke as a northern American president" when he remembered the Europeans "that live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they did not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the little of not very convinced, a bush's epoch, the former ambassador in the United Nations, John Bolton, qualified the talk of "monoton, pretensive and missing inspiration" on the Internet National Review Online site.
At the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed by seeing Barack Obama by justifiing the resource for force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justifie the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the Left Centre Pressing Elogised the President.
Los Angeles Time, although still believed that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, he qualified his speech of "superproduction" especially for a speaker known by his talent.
The speech of Oslo " should be used as a road sheet to guide international decisions in the fight against conflicts, poverty and oppression," said the California journal enthusiasmly.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary," he estimated New York Times, judged it "at the time of shadow and building".
Travel transport: three marathonic negotiations to ensure ship advancement
After three marathonic negotiations, the travel sector syndicates and the TLF (France Transfer and Logistics), the only patronal organization that remained until the end, reached on Thursday afternoon to an agreement that ends the consignment of ships and threats that occur on ship abuse.
The signature session on Thursday night, Dominique Bussereau was "rejoiced" by the agreement, after a number of negotiations that started midnight morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators departed on Friday with the hope of quickly signing the text in the last hour of the morning.
Even when three patronal organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) went away by giving a port.
But a halt of more than six hours that begins at 11 hours was necessary to all agree and the text is signed at 18 hours.
The conflict "should have been very dangerous for companies" and "which was afraid he would disturb the end-year festivals," Bussereau stated.
The text provides an increase of 4% for lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for higher ( international transport).
The tariff per hour exceeds 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low salaries.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disappointment, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, let's order our soldiers that there are no more shorts or blocks in the centres of accession.
But there can always be some disconformed revolt, he aggregated.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, recognised that it was "good agreement", although it was "easy to grant increases to high salaries taking into account international competition".
The increases are in the order of 170 euros menes for low salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common agreement and respects the asalariers, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognised it as a "historical agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "a acceptable commitment".
The Agreement also provides an increase in the 3% movement costs and the celebration of General Road Transport Assembly in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, allow to address the issue of an extraordinary payment and modernization of the collective convention.
Bussereau recalled that "a lower than 100 million euros in patronal burdens" was subject to an amendment of the Government in the project of rectification funds for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The Government will request the Senate that the vote "below the same terms".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the enterprises attached to this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, if the Minister of Work is in charge.
It'll be "with the greatest shortness," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of patronal organizations could only stop the process.
The FNTR claimed that it was a "engine negotiation", since the 100 million euros had already been promised to the sector to compensate part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of Transport State forced us to negotiate in a emergency situation, not as a conclusion of an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who want to eat pain at the next dinner of Nochebuena, Unostra was regreted.
For the OTR, the agreement is in risk of "the stability of many SMEs in the sector during the next 12 months".
RER A: Conflicts during the weekend, disconformed syndicates with RATP proposals
The conflicts in the RER A, the largest city transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, since on Friday, the second day of juice between syndicates and RATP address, there was no agreement, and the syndicats remained inadequate in respect of their first request.
For this important weekend of ship purchases, the Sabbath and Sunday will only be trains between 10 and 20 hours, due to a train of each two in the central tram ( between La Defense and Nation) and a train of each four in the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallerys, which wait for 200,000 clients every day, were happy that "the RATP tries to serve the large tents".
The RER Cross Western to East the Paris city.
The RATP tram comes from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Valeée.
This Wednesday, approximately one of the two trains was in a point of hours, and almost no trains in a valley hour, as it was planned.
Thursday, there was no disaster in the Andenes thanks to the organization of the people of the French Island.
In this way, in the alba, the Station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competitive than the normal, especially for the lack of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that it had been raised "a hour and a half more time to reach the time."
The St. Lazarus station did not saturate, indicated the SNCF, which had planned the supervision of police and forces of the order.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or with destination to this were coming or part of the St. Lazare station to join the meters.
The new general assemblies of workers in the hole will take place on Sunday and Sunday. The results will be analysed, "no satisfying" are the syndicates, of a way that has been carried out on Thursday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects of the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what the drivers want to claim a premium to be debt to them, the Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP also sets its premium proposals between parenteses, recommended the CGT irrelevantly, indicating that the direction "is not able to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
The RATP needed a new one on Monday to make "a more analysis on the terms of exercise of the profession," is expected.
What also led to the syndicates to say that the company "not imported the users from the end of the week."
On the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee in Paris.
Then the address, which was until then refused to dialogue during the wheelga, suggested the "to quiet the waters".
The conflict could be extended to the RER B on Thursday, after the Unsa and the Independents have presented a preliminary advice.
Syndicates ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, from which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and are decreased from the degradation of work conditions on this line with a million daily passengers.
The RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, cover from 2.200 to 2.700 brutal euros and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for hours with alternate turns, Sundays and dinner days.
Turkish justice dissolves the procured party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkey Constitutional Court failed on Friday for the resolution of the main procurement party of the country, a decision which immediately caused anger in the Kurd community, South East and Stambul.
This decision could very complicate the government's task, which just had a hand to the Kurd community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Partie of the Democratic Society (DTP) was disfellowshipped because it had become the "focus of activities that threatened the State independence and its indigenous unit", the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of decisions.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanime, although only a majority of seven votes needed to get the resolution, Kiliç indicated that 37 of the leaders of the party, including their President Ahmet Turk and Mr. Aysel Tugluk, were paragraphs of the political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity of which Turk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the goods of the party by the Tesoro.
The DTP accounts for 21 in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders warned before the verdict that the Members would leave the Parliament before being parliamentary without partial label.
The decision comes to the basis of a procedure laid down by the Supreme Court of Justice, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which charges the DTP to obey the "principes" of the Kurdistan Working Party (PKK), considered an Ankara terrorist organization and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that DTP is the legal political escape of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assured that it has no "organic connections" with PKK, but it refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls the government to negotiate with him.
The Court's verdict intervenes at the time the Government holds a hand to the Kurd community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus ending the conflict.
DTP leaders said that a solution could generate a recycling of pressures in Southeast Anatolio, where a large number of manifestations against PKK, Abdullah Öcalan, had been degenerated in the case of police during the last weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of manifestants were gathered before the DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the great care of Southeast population in their most courses.
The forces of the Order dropped lacrimogene granates and used water canons, while demonstrants lay Molotov bombs or stones with hunds.
In Stambul, hundreds of people were also concentrated around.
After the verdict, Turk claimed that the decision of justice would "profund the disloyalty".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (curda, NDLR) by resolving a party, stated the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic Movement, also lamentates the decision.
First, we are opposed to the closure of games.
So nothing was solved, stated the Ministry of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This boicote decision completely opened the democratic opening of the government, recommended the political analysis of Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, wait for a PKK reaction.
This Thursday, the PKK was appealed to an attack where seven soldiers died three days before in North of Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks of the last months.
Snows can start suddenly
A real fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something you want to do impossible life to the citizens, commenting on the director of the winter road maintenance of the FES
But with this, their employees can test and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
The weekend may be announced by the horologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to occupy snow and ice.
In this case, the FES acts in accordance with a mining plan.
As soon as the snow is in Frankfurt and the temperatures fall under zero degrees, 20 of the called tramos A with large salt vehicles, explains Brauburger.
Include, for example, main arteries and adventures such as the New Path and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access to the body of bombers, public transport paths, peatonal areas, and we travel with appeals, such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES's service begins around three morning
They must cover approximately 1.040 miles, if necessary, in a maximum of three hours with humid salt, which is better added.
Therefore, the FES starts around the three of the morning, "with this way the ways are free until the time trading begins."
The hard thing is when it starts to be impossible about 7:30 hours.
"Then we have a problem," comments the winter road maintenance director, "for then no one is ready to clean space for the vehicles with salt."
Immediately later, when he doesn't breathe anymore, he touches the secondary and private roads, which also belongs to the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has its side and secondary roads.
This is where the troubles are generated, you know, Brauburger.
About the five of the morning, the FES's infantery is running, mostly the dangerous and cross-border points are discovered.
Generally, the FES could not be charged by the total carriers for bicycles.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which does not lose view mainly for the pounds from 22 to 4:30 hours, comments Brauburger.
As these returns quickly packaging, the salt vehicle is running as soon as the temperature falls under two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The cow of the dinosaurium
The Tawa findlae had the same aspect as many other carnivor dinosauries: a two-meter-long animal and 1,50 meter height that runs on the two strong back foots, had a broad head with angry teeth and curves, short arms with bottles in the form of hoz and a long cow.
If the species had lived a few million years later, this wouldn't have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaures with these corporate features, reporting Sterling Nesbitt of the Texas University in Austin and colleagues in the July Science.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what now is New Mexico, which then was located in a secure area of the supercontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of the dinosaures, comments Nesbitt.
We show much about genealogical relations, propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaur.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists started an excavation in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes, in one day, we have found a dozen of dinosaurial bones, this is something without seats for Triasic, reports Randall Irmis member of the Team of Utah Natural History Museum.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the rest of five speeds were totally gathered.
A finding confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaures
The name "Tawa" comes from the God of the sun of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is a local finding: "The Triasic dinosaurial fossiles are extremely rare, generally only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not mean that enthusiasm.
This finding is not especially spectacular, but confirms some theory about the ancient history of the dinosaures, for example, Martin Sander of the Bonn University.
The current opinion running was the dynamics appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossiles are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosauries is very controverse.
So the experts discuss, for example, about which saurises were divided into their three most important genealogical lines: the carnifold theropodes of the Tyronasaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the saropodes known as the "language cut" and their families, and the Ornithischia herbs (saurius with birds), which belong to, for example, the Triceratops and Stegosaurus species.
The analysis of Nesbitt and its colleagues is described, Tawa hallae is a primitive therope.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa crown, researchers found indications of air bottles, such as the seeds of the theropodes, the birds.
Thanks to the air bottles, the breathing of the birds is more than the mamifers.
In the case of Tawa, also the bones of the vertebral column were evidently full of air partly.
Tawa is the theropode with the oldest and primitive air balls, comments Randall Irmis.
Since the line of the later gigant saropodes also had air bottles and light bones, the common precessors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three ears towards North America
Since the most primitive dinosauries were living in South America until now, researchers deduct that the suns have come up for the first time.
Thus, the three genealogic lines were separated from a beginning and spread from South America through all the rivers of the Earth, which then still formed a single earthly mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team met with Tawa find the rest of two other non-intimate terrorists.
The three cannot descend from a single empire preceptor, the researchers argument.
We believe that at least three holes have been given to North America, commenting Alan Turner of the American Natural History Museum in New York, with the Science study.
Of course, there are also opposers.
An even older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of brothers of the dinosaures, lived in the current Poland, comments on Bonn Martin Sander's paleontologist.
Its opinion could give a distortioned picture, because simply in South America are keeping many dinosaures fossiles, while in other continents there is only something to discover.
The question of how the dinosaures have achieved evolution of a rare colateral line of reptils to the dominant earthquakes of the Mesozoic is still an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triaxis, the dinosaurers still had their vital space with many other reptils, such as the predests of the current cocodrils and the pterosauries and many other sauries.
Before the end of the Triaxis, the dinosauries spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the parent was extinguished at the border of the Triasic to the Jurasic.
The successful stories were not eternal
There are two chances to explain this change, comment Martin Sander.
It could have been given a massive extinction to which the dinosauries surrounded by chaitée, but the other reptils were not.
Or the dinosauries were better adapted, so they could win the counterparts in the area.
The successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, an impact on the water of a group of species, which also had been developed in the Triaxis and since then had a miserable existence: the mammifers.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatures.
Participe teachers of the University of Toronto, Cambria, Vienna or Berkeley, in California.
Teachers of Napoles, Quebec, Edimburg, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police department of the occupied casino of the University of Frankfurt has been affected throughout the world.
278 Professors and Cathedrals of the University of Goethe, although also of higher education centres in all Germany, Europe and South America, are solidized with students in protest in the Westend Campus.
In a statement published in German and English, the police department promoted by the directive advice.
Werner Mämer-Estler, president of the university, made the last week the building occupied by students and teachers in educational garage because the walls and works of art were propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered lesions.
Material damage, the firms judge, does not justifie "the violent solution of the courses organized by the same students and catedrals by a police command".
The development represented a "inacceptable attack" to the freedom of research and investigation.
The approach in vandalism served for "the delegacy and criminalisation of the protest" and refused the attention of the content.
The directive Council has refused to implement the necessary negotiations.
Teachers require the immediate retirement of the reclamation of the court.
Most employees have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legislated Protest
Youths of the Great Syndicat and the German Federation of Sindicatos are also solidized with students.
Protection is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future, commenting on the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Hessen Scientific Minister, however, defended the action of the university and police rector.
We're grateful to the college rector.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, starting in a current Stunde emission on Thursday in the Parliament of the Provincy of Wiesbaden.
We are comprehensive with the protest, but we are not comprehensive with vandalism, expressed Peter Beuth, delegated by the Province parliament by the CDU.
The view of opposition factions, the SPD, the Green and the left, is different.
The CDU used as pretext the walls designed to criminalize the protest, expressed Janine Wissler (Iz¤da).
Instead of studying the arguments and needs of the students, they are developed.
Iceda has presented an invitation, in which it is requested to present a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible for west visitors.
Selected, one of the ten of Moscou, was in the Soviet Union a strongly kept place for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216.000 inhabitants, which is 37 miles from the centre of Moscow, is considered as the "Silicon Valley of Russia".
Here are important research and production centres of micro-electronic and nano-electronic.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Selenogrado have contacted Riedberg's centuries in Frankfurt, the university institutions and the company of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now, Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg signed in Frankfurt a "Cooperation Protocol est".
The Moscow Vice-Alcalde Juri Rosljak and Selengrado's college, Anatoly Sünnov, were headed by the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed Edwin Schwarz planning service head.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the Research Centre for Natural Scientists will travel to a Seminar.
Switch Science
It is a continuous scientist exchange.
But it also handles commercial relations.
The FIZ firms will have the possibility of put a foot on the growing Russian market.
Instead, Russian citizens want access to contracts in Germany.
Selected is the seat of important Russian research enterprises and institutions.
These are, for example, the Moscovit Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortiums of Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronica.
The community was founded in 1958 as the "Socialist planning City" for arming research.
Selected (translated literally as "Green City") received its name of the landscape of forest mountains, where research facilities were located.
Stuttgart's Frinos
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not placed for nothing as high enough.
For the partners of the project it is simple and quietly related to "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous building project, which will predict the capital of the region of Banden-Württemberga a decade of unremediable building sites.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with railways, which ended in the middle of the city, were considered at that time in the 19th century's engineering fossiles, which acted as frens of a modern railway traffic, since anciently there was a great amount of time to engage back-to-over the locking engineers.
Rotation, stop traveling, but this must be done.
And therefore, the terminals were to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station of pass, which is about half of the tray of transeuropeian operational lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; of ­ the slogan of "Europe's Corazon".
The S21 will actually be started, although the visions of the 1980s are not more compatible with the reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in Hessian capitals and barbares it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals, of course, also have no more input and outcome problems, since there are reversible location engines with tractor unit and car of the driver in both extremely.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE building tram to Ulm will already be started.
The Federal and Communal Policies have so prepared it.
The railway is still because the risks of the major infrastructure infrastructure projects are led by the contributor and not by the State.
From urbanistic view, the project is still justified to a certain point.
A new city space is created, provided from many green areas, probably from the graphs generated by computer of the designer.
For the railway transport system, S21 is harmful.
Step station and vial support are considered for transport of persons, which has been attributed to the huge typical growth of 1980's decade.
At that time, there was no competition for low cost flights.
However, modern transport policy should first be able to strengthen the transport of goods, since railway transport is considered more ecological than the cars carried out on roads.
However, the new building traces are good for load trains due to intense gradients.
More serious is that S21 also directly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the Zu¤s.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifty billion.
It is sure that in the next department, money will be missing in other cruces and hard passports on the network.
In total, sixty larger projects are located in the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extent of more than 180 miles [100 km] from the Rin valley.
Since 1987, the trail was built lately.
It would be urgent here to piss the accelerator as it's due.
However, S21 acts as freno.
The stream of the Rin valley will be the bottle bottle for international goods transport: a § of the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the sentence on the port.
The Federal Government leaves the autonomous parliament of Wiesbaden, if it will present a resource of appropriation before the failure on the division of the Hesse Administrative Court of Justice.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have committed experts the legal investigation of VGH's judgment, more than 400 pages, said the Ministry of Economics, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had written based on this date, that in the case of the construction of the North-East landing track planned in the Frankfurt port, the Federated State would have to re-regulate the employment of night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as provided by the Federal Government, would not be compatible with the obligatorial legal protection of the population of the voice due to air traffic.
The coalition must be decided until 4 January, whether it will present the resource of appointment against this sentence.
The opposite criticized this postergation and pressed the representatives of the Government to reject the resource of appointment before the Court of Justice in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD Group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises of the night air transit, which they had done before elections. In contrast, this could be taken as a lack of word.
It's pretty difficult, if one allows him to fulfil his word, the head of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir said, repeating the FDP slogan "We do our word."
Minister Posch 日 the repository of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the Federative Government would be able to take into account the rights and trucks still to get its night flights.
A exhaustive legal investigation would need enough time.
The coalition wouldn't want to act on the basis of a "fast print".
We need a legally intactable decision, said Stefan Mämer (FDP).
As the opposite represents it, their group's holdings would never have been regarding the night air traffic.
The United States Aid Returns.
The major responsibility and responsibility of the crisis are disappointed from their state attitudes.
The "Bank of America" once returned the aid that he had provided to the Tarp Rescue Fund for a total of 45,000 million (approximately EUR 30,000).
The Citi group also plans for State aid, a report of the CNBC of the United States.
In this way, institutions intend to be released from the restrictions that have gone out of hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation of bonus payment to directors, as well as the payment of high taxes.
The "Bank of America" had achieved approximately 19 billion billion liquid money to the conversion of goods.
The rest of the sum took it from the own box, which had a lot of means, among others for the sale of rubbers.
Manual director Kenneth Lewis thanked the midnight specially for contributors and employers: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult moments.
The household had failed to calculate the effort of absorption of investment in the financial crisis climate.
The Citi group also intends to get money on the capital market to be able to be released from its obligations from the state.
The CNBC reported from the source of known circles that the EEC and IA could already announce the increase of its capital for $20 billion for Thursday.
A representative of the Citi Group did not want to make comments.
In June they had already returned their Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Selection
At the end, everything was faster than he thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF administrative advice (German television channel) is pressed on the Nikolaus Brender editor head to leave its position, the channel can present a successor.
I've been voting about the candidate yesterday.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF main study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the holder, officially so that it would not be before the procedure.
But it must have also affected the notion of the director of ZDF Markus Schächter if this proposal would not be adopted in the administrative advice.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the gremium.
The outcome of the vote has not yet been concluded with the conclusion of this and of this.
Two weeks ago, Schätter failed in the administrative advice with its proposal to renew the Nikolaus Brender contract for more than five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's destitution was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Why the majority of the Union in the Administrative Council had indicated that they would not support Brender at its position for weeks before the election.
The opposition against the Hesse Government, Mr. Roland Koch, had been organized by the President of the Hesse Government.
He declined another mandate of the Prestigious Review Chairman with the argument that the ZDF information was lost under Brender's direction.
Soon before the elections, there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on ZDF was flagned.
At the end, 35 public-looking experts had been enrolled in the debate, which qualified Koch's progress as an inconstitutive.
But he didn't serve anything.
About the Person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogies and romantic filology.
Then he worked in the Southwest and in the Journal "Frankfurter ́dschau".
In 1983 he was changed to ZDF, in the beginning to the "heute-journal" information.
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reporter of the head of the editor; 1991/92 responsible in Washington; until 1998 the Madagascar program "Morgenmagazins" director of the ZDF External Policy; since then the ZDF study director in the capital.
The Green political party announced a constitutional request after Brender's destination, which was still selected as a journalist of the year by the Medium Magazin media.
The opposite of Koch in the administrative Council, the President of the Government of Renania-Palatinated, explained last week that federal states should change the ZDF State Convention in such a way that the proposals of the director's staff could not be locked by a majority with political motivation.
A retraction of partial politicians from ZDF control gremium was dismissed by Beck.
The successor of Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended before the administrative advice with a smart game: he criticized strongly the gremium for Brender's destitution.
Thanks to this periodic evidence of independence as well as Schächter could designate it to the head of redaction without the face, as well as the administrative advice could vote, without the doubt of giving him the position to a party-party sequence.
In the estimates of Frey partys, it is all kinds of adjudicated to the left liberals.
College carriers are exposed
Partial success for students: After a year of holidays related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the Federated States finally ceased. At a meeting of the Ministrs of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to improve the conditions of study in license and master cases.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their carriers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the load of tests: basically every carrier module should be completed with one single examination.
Moreover, it is intended to examine the labour of students, and it wants to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and Universities also want to simplify the recognition of the results of tests between Universities within and outside Germany.
Federated states are committed to construct more flexible the rules of the joint rules for carriers of Bachelor and Master.
Regulations of federal states that differ from this should not exist anymore.
Lower Tests
From the beginning of the study protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and University Directors continue to speak of the improvement of the ability to perform and conclude a career (studiability).
Now for the first time it was spoken of a specific content.
The so-called acreditation advice agreed to drasticly reduce the number of tests: "Each module ends with one single examination," it is said in a document of 30 pages, which intends partly to regulate the approval of university carriers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the load of tests" it is intended to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would be sensitively affected by studyability, thus the Director of the Acreditation Council, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Moreover, in a future, the "studiability" must be the decisive criteria in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be exhaustively examined as regards the unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice.
the courses.
Students would have the right to get more spaces, which can and promote their own initiative.
These rules would be governed for new carriers, but also in the existing course review.
These must be "recredited" again every five years, but this would mean, that it would be late until 2015 to review all carriers.
The responsible for this would be at the level of the country's 10 acreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the acreditation advice, which is installed by the federal states.
Ministers of Education and Culture encouraged the federal states in October to affect the agencies in such a way that the number of materials and exames are not too strict or urgent.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already been agreed with the ministers to take such measures.
Even now only Renania-Platinada has ensured to facilitate additional means for the subsequent development of the Bolonia process.
With this money, universities must implement programmes of protection and study advice, as well as strengthening exam offices and outside.
The Federated State and the universities are intended to provide 10 million euros for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wants to bring to Parliament a news of the university law.
It should be sufficient for a single examination for the conclusion of a carrying model.
The configuration of the carrier should be more flexible, and the recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating access to Master.
To the end of the year that comes, all carriers are intended to be examined about their "studiability".
This Thursday the government and opposition discussed again the conditions to study in the federal state.
In addition to the elogies, there were also critical decisions.
In the joint directive at the federal level of the University Groups Juso (Young Socialists) the question was that the configuration of educational policy should not be carried out anymore "by closed doors" of the ministers and university directors.
Lately after the bullets of education, students as the main involucrates should also be able to think.
The President of the University Rector Assembly (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, supported the students: "We need the experience of students," said the student at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK decided on a joint reform document.
For the University of Education and Science (GEW) Bonn's agreements were not enough: the syndicat requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor the possibility to be at a later Master carrier.
Furthermore, federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in a future enough study places for Master with the best possible studie conditions. Thus a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller, informed this.
Federated states have a lot more teachers.
But about a greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not make comments.
More than a note about Herta M.
"Incoming and exiting from Germany is practically uncontrolled" says the first line of a poema of the Werner Sõner lire in disequilibrant language fragments, in which the experiences of arrival to Germany lived by a president who wined his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Sünner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at the beginning as German and English professor in Bucarest, and then as a reader in an editorial of infant books before he moved to Frankfurt in 1982.
In 1993, Sõner gave him several premiums of ́a, he presented memorable lessons or talks of poesy in Frankfurt at the University of Goethe, and since 2002 he was director of the Forum of Hesse in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
God who speaks very much last Thursday during a meeting in Munich about "The German Literature in Romania in the speech and the disfigured speed of its security expedients"
Visiblely unsecure and confused, Sõner read a statement in which he admitted the participation as IM in the Roman secret service Security against German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In addition to some of the presents in 1989, Sõner had received the German Premium from the language.
The recruitment at the beginning of 1971 had started quietly.
"This is why I am someone who has not been adequately defended against the intentions of provoking the security fear," finali  ։
The Lirico Werner Sünner is the IM Walter.
Almost at the same time of the concession of the Nobel premium to Herta Mämer and its literary policy without equality with the dictatory domination mechanisms, the literary scene is excluded and, in particular, the community of German authors originating in Romania for a case that shows abisms and wickedness of a political system, based on control and spiralisation.
Werner Sämner is, so it is known to now, not only author but also victims.
At his Safety Poster IM Walter had played a role, the literary scientist Michael Markel said after Sõner's confession, and recalculated the influence for him positive of the IMI Walter.
He had excused or defended him in all the difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel moral need to do this," he said.
The statement of Sõner in this way and before this public was unexpected, however, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Roman secret service is not so surprised.
Germany would have been a comfortable repository for spices of the Security-Spitzel had been, wrote Herta Mämer already in July in the weekend "Time", after reading his own issue of 914 pages.
The involucrates will certainly have speculated and in some cases will have known what names would be hidden behind the suburbs of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the revision of Stasi expedients with a procedure controlled in Germany, the treatment with the Security Controls is still very difused.
A systematic statement has been seen boicote and difficult in recent years.
A national advice for the clarification of the Security issues (CNSAS), corresponding to Birthler authority, was formulated in 1999, and the delivery of the issuers since then has been given better to traces.
Since 2005, there is a law governing the administration of expedients.
A interview, after the concession of the Nobel premium to Herta M日er, proved that the influence of ancient members of the Security in Romania is still very large. In this interview, an ex-Cheef of the Security of Temevar spoke despectly of the condecorated.
"He has psychosis," at the end they only asked her once.
The power's foam seemed to be shown without revenge in the form of the freedom of opinion.
Of course, there are inevitable questions with the case Sõner, as many times when there are silent faults.
Why right now? Who has caused damage? The quiet reaction of the hearers against Sõner's confession allows you to expect that the continuation of this story will be more controlled by the concerns of knowledge, not as well as by the adjudication of faults and by the view of responsibility.
For the genesis of the work of Herta M¤er, which last night accepted the Nobel de¤pension, it is more than a simple note at the feet.
The Campeons Liga as a warning to fill the stomach
When the new trainer of the Football VfB team of Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a narrow color plastic box of its team provider, a taxi Mercedes of la Se C a fourth hour after midnight, he impressed that a member of the external service elegantly dressed was going out from a very pleasant celebration of Christmas, in which the sporting article manufacturer would have distributed shows.
The man of calva characteristics had contracted a shopper, because he still didn't know the city.
On the other hand, he could also have driven the car himself: to the end, there was no alcohol in the game, and he wasn't born of joy to the 55-year-old man.
It was a pleasant guard, but tomorrow I would start the job again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In its words, which had been contracted only three days ago: "It is true that we reach the eights of the end," mean, in the Campeons Liga, thanks to the trionph 3:1 against Urziceni Union, of Romania, "but we can't let us blind for success: we'll have to fight brutally against the decline."
The "much more important task" waited for them on Sunday next, he departed.
Then you will need to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classs" in the liga's dailyness.
And remove the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sort
The octaves final of the Campeons Liga (parts of ida on 16/17 and 23/24 of February/flight party 9/10 and 16/17 of March) shall be sorted on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the flaming entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the suspected salvator, who had soon inspired the unconcerned Professors of Stuttgart confidence in themselves, ready to deliver and enjoy the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strong points, I insisted on them to be launched, explained the repository of Gross to their receipt of success that simply sounds, but that with the Babbel therapy had no effect.
He showed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's party, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes on the football, sometimes happens things that couldn't be believed."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a pause of several weeks due to an avan’s lease to become the best local player thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the "fenomen" perceived by the proverb "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who interacts in the background, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the present situation."
And this was what I missed, of course, when I was Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart has not been tested yet, warn the Horst Heldt Sport Director
But VfB Stuttgart needs more than all constants.
Like Gross, also players and administrators have abstained from overvaluing the triumph against a debilitated defence for the lack of relief and totally rebased from the Roman invitations.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the trist wake up, he thought about Khedira.
And Director Horst Heldt warned that although an objective of the season was achieved, the other still was very far.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt had no pleasure to celebrate at his birthday number 40, even after the first victory at his seat from three months ago, he was responsible for the end of the week, which had been updated again in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had granted the port Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that take others, and not Jens, held Heldt the hard critical of Lehmann.
This had reproached deficiency in the direction of the direct advice, which had decided to change a trainer by the pressure of adolescents.
Also that it would have removed his free day after the games, Lehmann calified it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and enemy.
Lehmann's statements were "seas for the pure egoism," he replied, and announced consequences for the last.
Probe'e will no longer be friends forever, the two quarters.
But at least they agreed with all other in that, without the predicted efforts to the trainer's team, the spectacle of great game and battle force would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a significant participation in success," Heldt and Lehmann said to the unisson, and he was also in accordance with the man of the plastic malta.
Heat of the World Weight Championate
Ardent pain in Berna: Once and again, Kevin Johnsonn was providing the world campaign Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his weight title in the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was unanime.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still a worldwide weight campaign.
The 38-year-old campaign in the WBC Association version wined on Wednesday night at the Sabbath in Berna, and 日 Kevin Johnson for a single decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
Klitschko was its third successful defense of the title since its return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was a world campaign of WBO and WBC associations two times.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to do the damage they all had expected.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 trionphs in 41 professional fights, two times he had to be overcome due to his lesions.
Rector Johnson had to accept the first destruction in his fight number 24.
Before approximately 17000 spectators in the Berna Arena, Klitschko, with a station of 2.02 meters, he wanted to say the battle above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, which before the wound had announced the end of the era Klitschko, was striving once again from the world campaign's golpes, so Klitschko couldn't take its decisively to its right target.
In general, passive Johnson did too little for a retractor, and just tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was providing Klitschko with words and gestures, his golpes only rarely reached the world campaign.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the battle, the tractor had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombies" that "he knows nothing."
When the weight was made, the campaign was left to provoke the Friday to remove Johnson's sun wheels from the narrow "to see his eyes."
Fourth trionfo after Klitschko return
Also in its fourth fight after its return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invensive.
After a pause of almost four years, he returned to the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and he had recovered his "su" circle from the WBC, which had to be delivered without fighting before.
This year later he was in his defense of the title to Juan Carlos Gómez, from Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this fight, I only received a bulpe, and I'm very good with physical, Klitschko explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still gathering all four important titles in your family.
His brother Vladimir is a world campaign of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the cinture belongs to the British David Haye, after this destronomy in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 metres of station.
In the previous year, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
It seems that the company that promotes it is planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley stadium of London.
The case Kunduz
The front attack of the opposite: the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called a liar to the Defence Minister, Gutenberg, because of information on Kunduz matter.
The SPD and the isities require an explanation to the cancer.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the most recent revelations on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposite has reproached the Defense Minister, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), who has been engaging in the knowledge of the cause.
In the "Tagesschau" news issue of the Sabbath, transmitted by the ARD television channel, the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the Minister "the Witness has not said the truth" on the death bombardement of two convoyes.
In such a case, it usually says, he said lies.
The murder order would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Group for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr. Gutenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Wednesday, it was given to know that in this attack it was not only trying to destroy the secure cars but also to kill two Taliban leaders intentionally.
In the air attack of the United States, requested by the German Commander of Kunduz, Coronel Klein, in accordance with the NATO investigation report, died or were disappointed up to 142 persons.
The Green, the SPD and the left moved the Sunday to the Federal Cancer Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to explain what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs. Merkel has to explain whether an intentional murder strategy is part of the Federal Government Policy of Afghanistan, and if cancer, armies and information services have adopted this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and its colleague of the Green Renate Künast.
The Government's carrier, Ulrich Wilhelm, 日 decisively critical.
The cancer had no influence on concrete actions of the German Army in Afghanistan, said.
The Sabbath had also made doubts about the presentation that the Minister had made on the reasons for the emergency of the general inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
SPIEGEL information is provided, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on convoyes.
Officially it was said that they had refused the existence of the NATO reports and had hidden details delegated to the Minister.
However, from the surrounding of the two high-range officers, they had even pointed to the Defense Minister of Defence the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Coronel Klein, who was at the command, and a report of a field patrol.
However, Wichert would have requested in a letter to acknowledge the matter, report the journal "Frankfurter Allgemer Sonntagszeitung".
You haven't received a response until the time.
The Ministry has not been shown on the Sabbath in respect of the reproaches made to him, and he noted that this would be declared in the Committee on Research of the Federal Parliament, which will be represented in the next midnight.
Honiric Worlds
In the state of watch, some people see pictures and hear voices that others don't see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental and drug-dicts, the limits between imagination and reality are disappeared.
While it happens during the dream, everything's okay.
When we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver us without work to the most wild imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, who experiences similar states as dream during the watch, or looks and hears things that others don't see or hear, most times in the modern west world are considered as foolish or drugdict, or at least as handicap.
But such images and voices are not only in mental or drugs.
The fault has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to draw houses, pains or write news, sometimes make the limits between dream, foolishness and reality.
The warning states that have been modified onirically can appear in the most different ways, in the best of the cases we call them visions, and in the worst, foolish.
Although the decadenants and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the Hilldegard von Bingen magic, the psychodelic experiences of the Prophet of the New Era Castañed Carlos, the states of chamanic position, and the psychosis and halucinations can be transmitted.
The hallucinations or deliries arise when the balance of neuronal communications substances in the brain has been discovered –on all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonine and acetylcoline – and the interaction between various parts of it is disturbed.
A very often squizophrenic psychosis appears complete hallucinations and injured thoughts.
Greatness has no power on him anymore
The relationship between foolish and dream has been occupied with philosophs and doctors since the old time.
Aristoteles designed the hallucinations as a form of dream in surveillance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatricity, found in 1861 a "great similarity of the status of foolish states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disproportions, all placed trainings, and speechisms of this".
It's the 2001 hour when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
His body is of two dimensions and scandally colored.
Greatness has no power over him anymore, it's floating near the room's tissue.
He feels a bitch.
behind him, figures of demons with ales, with red mouths like blood, deforms, refining the teeth.
They're pursuing it, painting it with weak and flaming boots, smoking it against the walls, he feels pains throughout the body.
Strengthen and malignant voices are from walls and radios.
You can't support them anymore, the voices that insult him and hurt him.
Henning T. throws two caves from the stereo, the worms to form an ahorcade node, and fixes them in a cup in the dark.
He goes up in a bottle and puts the node around the wheel.
Wait.
The ear is swimming.
What a lesson it serves to you!, they cry voices in a coron that reveals him the timpanes, "Go to the clinic and make them cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six mild psychosis, last two years ago, the first about 20 years ago.
The cause he produced was the LSD.
His diagnostic is psychosis squizo-afective-paranoid, and is maniaco-depressive, takes medicines, against depression, mania, squizofrenia.
He's lived with his sickness, he's married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the most terrifying tribulation and the deepest desperateness, says.
Alucinations are a cruel reality
At least one percent of the population falls at least once in the life of squizofrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an aggressive squizophrenic psychosis, most of the times the affected people can no longer distinguish between the outer world and the inner, and they fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, deliries of magnitude, disturbances in the relationship, or persecution.
Specially extended is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are also often.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what it is not, the brain can no longer filter the signals of disturbance, consciousness is seen inundated by impressions.
Like dream, also psychosis opens computes to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest levels of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, says Catedral Thomas Fuchs, doctor of the general psychiatric clinic of the Heidelberg university hospital.
The Squizofrenic is located in the center of the Actions, everything has a meaning to him.
At the same time, it comes into a passive role, as in a dream, feels abrumed by the acts and can't organize them actively.
It is therefore that squizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, it is wake up, impossible.
Have experienced a hallucination once in life
In contrast, in a dream, Fuchs says, "the space and sensory of the reality that is in psychosis remains in the beginning."
Paranoic thoughts and alucinations are supported in reality, the distance of experience is in reality.
For researchers is still an unknown reason why our brain makes cabriols.
Se日 Fuchs, the states of imprisonment can lead to any person to the contact with the reality temporarily.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic provision for squizofrenia, but studies in them have shown that there are also other determinant factors in addition to genes.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimum brain damage.
We assume that the neuronal brain madure is affected in a timely stadium of development, such as ≥ a virus disease of the mother during the pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it is still an inconsistent how this change of neuronal system is produced, which is also not absolutely shown for many years.
The influence of the environment plays also a significant role – the stress or traumatic experience can be the detonators of a psychosis when there is already a previous provision.
Similarly, alcoholic drugs can cause psychosis, because they interfere with the brain transmission system.
When brain is warm
The illusion of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very careful medicines to be released from them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the cathedral in the psychology Erich Kasten, of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as a pleasant or not often depends on the view point.
Kasten collected reports about hallucinations and visions since ten years ago and analysed the results in the book Die irreale World in our head (The irreal world in our head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also, often, of many other diseases.
In addition to psychical distortions such as the depression limits of personality or depression, they are also often illnesses such as the epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer and croneoencephale traumatisms.
the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
Alucinations, if Kasten, are composed of memories that usually are repressed.
Surge when the brain areas where sensoral perceptions are processed are hyperactive or shortly cohibed; when our brain is warm, but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can cause this state of the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimulus, stress, loving evil or other brain states.
In younger ones, it has been a third of the questionnaires to have at least once in life a Halluzination.
In 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, he lived in a small city of Mecklenburg-Pomerania O≤al and attended a secondary education college.
A running girl.
If it wasn't by those images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, a boy gets towered with a long and dark hair guides his word.
When she answers her, the other students look at her in subjection; no one, except her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the fucking girl is a little strange song, but Sarah K. She knows she's not dreaming.
She's wake up and come and listen to that boy, as she looks and hears the girl sitting at the side.
You can even feel your presence, at least some instincts.
It's a pleasant feeling. He likes the boy.
Sometimes you ask if you're crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappeared.
For nights, appearances are alarming.
Views are often a load.
When you are in class, you can't follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest explains the matematic equations in a way and audible way.
For nights, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to come the dream, which often comes late and is unexpected, you don't know whether you're wake or dreaming, if the images that you see, the muckles or girl with bloody cortes in your arms and feet, appear before their open eyes or closed.
Leave me in peace, call them to the figures.
Your parents and friends didn't tell them anything, they would think she's crazy.
Ottone 2009. Sarah K. He is today 20 years old.
He adopted the last year selectivity and lived with his boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations have disappeared.
Since you've been contacting the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, you know it's not crazy.
Much is also a work of art for desperation.
See Kasten, when a person is here socially or suffers a restriction of stimulus, it is very well that after a time he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and it is worth the same to look for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, for 13 years, he learned that the man who calls Dad since he has used the reason is not his biological father.
After the visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and sound impressions, those affected as Sarah K. It is difficult to distinguish between visions and realities. "Every experience," says Kasten, "the reality is located in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not different from the fundamental of the one of an aggressive psychosis.
In contrast, the squizophrenics are psychically healthy people to recognize their visions as irreal.
Kasten recommends that your patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special ability.
Limitation between dream and hallucination
In this world too focused on consciousness, imaginary experiences are generally patological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, catedrical in Heidelberg and physician of the psychiatric and psychotherapy of Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease, but that also brings something positive and creative – foolishness is a work of art of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the called honourism, a special form of consciousness, which is felt as if it was a dream.
Onic hallucinations are almost very complete and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and then cannot be different from being awakened.
The unirical states arise in extreme ability associated with a trauma or a disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropatia, who experience a motor paralysis with full consciousness.
It is Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of one or one of the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, this substitutes a very dangerous real situation by a own and imaginary world that is disappointed from the reality.
A form of limited situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a world change, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving sense and interpretation to an inconsistent situation that our own creation capacity allows us to do nothing of the loss of conscience.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The historic of art Peter Cornelius, of Zürich, also describes his unbelieving experiences in his book Heart Change as an action for the salvation of the soul.
She was 49 years old, when her conscience was shipd in travels for several days after a cardiac cardiovascular transplant operation, while her body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
In a world created by itself, he visited strange places of other times:is seen posted in the bed, a larger man on the board of a sanatorium on a train, a robot watched for his health.
He was seen in the High Media Age, around nobles that produced drugs from blood.
A Greek on a moto cut him out in his country of origin, surfed his hospital bed in the Alpes with snow snow and found him with a corean mafia.
He gives it all in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For you, these internal travels are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, describes your experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much more clear, even in the irrelevant details.
More clear and intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatra Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, honourism, psychosis, hallucinations and consumption of drugs shows the fragil that is the internal reproduction of the outer reality, even when we are wake up.
Each change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriched.
Snow can come
Burda
Children will be charged by the editorial for 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, recommended SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The Hubert Burda editor sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
Both children become 27-year-old inheritants and have the firm will to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69-year-old, to SPIEGEL.
Details have been regulated as a precautionary measure.
The following question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they're worth it.
One can't put 7.500 workers before his children, if they are not enough for it.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda met the Thursday that will be removed from January from the Presidency of the Joint Directive and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed by his follower.
This member of the family Kallen, from 52, is member of Burda from 1999.
At the beginning, he was responsible for technology.
Later, it was charged for the treasury, and thereafter he reached the responsibility for the company's possession. After Jürgen Todenhaver's outcome, he also was charged with the direct marketing, the foreign, the printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is involved in the editorial cuspide.
Burda's sons are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who now was 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to, "Save the differences of 10, 15 years", is Description Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With the view of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Burda showed that family companies are not too unless they were responsibility: "This has always affected families that are allowed to be counted by the capital search, which were judged badly and thought they could be raised as well as the largest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I've never had "great deliries", Burda.
I don't see as a political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world liga; these businesses have been made too large.
Integral Beauty
Everything - in the matter of beauty and well-being - you can wish, at the reach of your hand.
This is what it seems to have been proposed The English Court, which just has invoked in the commercial centre of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mimo of the body.
The spa, held in the eighth plant, accounted with prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which is responsible for the depilation of laser-; Spaxion, with the relaxation rooms and the treatment of the steady treatment; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or, which has a gimnasio, or L'Oëtane and its natural cosmetic, among others.
There is also a section of food, where the tethery is highlighted, with more than 130 different classes than this infusion.
enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while looking at the incredible views of the capital, or purchasing the relax zone for two hours to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relaxing with a jacuzzi, massages session and taking a copy of a champagne are some of the possibilities that provide Spaxion.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and more recent face-, body- and therapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to fight celllitis or vibratory platforms.
The gimnasio also relates to these machines, as well as with some 'trenctors' who guide customers' steps, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
Everything begins by introducing your personal key in a tactful screen, faced with the machine.
So, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Your director assures that 15 minutes (≥ calamity and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after we exercise our body, we want to pass through the peluquery, the signature Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals are offered for recovery of the hair, beauty or nutrition personally.
Innovation and Property seem to have been the premises of this city spa, which will be opened every day of the year, from 10:00 to 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 of the night.
Miscellaneous
It's close to Christmas and it's never more to consider the looks of the stars to adapt them to our festival clothes.
The way of listening, very important to highlight the siluet, is one of the variables we should take into account.
There's a few suggestions.
The song Fergie chose an exagered and very complicated listen. It's not very advisable.
Endsa and Barcelona, with the car
The company's ends, together with the Barcelona Assembly, has created the 'Live office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the road vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE Office (Logistic for the Implantation of the Vehicle El ́trico) will define and coordinate the road table for the implantation of the car and will achieve a mobility agreement, managing, coordinating, presenting subventions, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project will develop, promote the car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to impulse what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Soulties of the Trinity'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implantation of the car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla are added to the project.
They are the three cities selected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to stimulate the implantation of the vehicle.
The Company of the Endsa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generality of Catalunya.
It is therefore intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Catalogue Autonomous Community.
The activities linked to energy, in particular to energy.
It is not the only initiative in which Endsa participates in the promotion of the road vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a series of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT Verde.
Zapatero comes 'a silence hour' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, appears "a quiet hour" for the Spanish car industry, which, recalled, is the main exporting sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Information of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero repealed the measures that the Executive has made throughout the exercise to support the car sector.
"Unless the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we today would have a abandonment panorama, to close some of our main productive plants," said the President of the Government.
"Gracies to this plan and to the provision of the marks to be followed in Spain, in a very high sector, we can have a quiet hour for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Automotion Plan (PIA), determined 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 aid companies, which mobilised a investment of more than 3.000 million euros.
The Executive Boss explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the governmental measures for support to the request, in allocation to the Plan 2000E, implemented in cooperation with autonomous communities and automobilistic marks.
The President, this plan has allowed the average reduction of the new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market to 6% and has contributed to a "fortunate increase" of the matriculations, which increased "40%" in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first and second of the International Room of the Classic Vehicle will be celebrated, a meeting space for professionals and affiliated from the engine's mount.
This initiative will be developed during 5-7 February 2010 in the Cristal Pabellon of the Campo de Madrid House.
It is an exhaustive surface of 200,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only classic motorcycles and cars can be found, but in ClassicAuto Madrid will be found articles of any kind related to the engine world.
Thus, among the exemplificators of the pavilion, accessories, changes, components, textile accessories, plugins, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectionists and curious.
Among participating companies, including Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; the Classical Cochera, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External ability tests
Furthermore, the commercial activity of this Room will be completed with parallel activities: celebration of concentrations, sport exhibitions, accommodation tests, presentations and concurrences.
Classical cars and motorcycles will also be performed in a circuit disabled outside of the ferial rent.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportability
Mazda wants to prove that sportability is not rejected with respect for the environment.
Therefore, just inserted Mazda3 the engine stop system - baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horse.
This second generation of Mazda3 highlights the good note reached throughout its whole.
The ends, the end of the vehicle, the apartment, the behavior, the mechanism, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are supersaying in the new Mazda3.
Once we start with the leading position, we check that the front bottles present a excellent ethnomia and submission.
Moreover, the tact of the flight is exquisite.
Following the total formed by the table of instruments and the console, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend to create a future internal design, with a large number of buttons and commands and colors called red and a.
This style, in part, reveals us to the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are contrary to the subad of the German products, and in particular the Volkswagen Golf, to which everyone wants to be baptized.
With the habit, this Japanese compact provides more than enough room for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is summarized a wide malter and regularly.
The engine's Breaking and autostart system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-lit gasoline engine and 150 horses and with the manual shift of six routes.
This engine is an authentic delicies. Oversee for its finger, by its reduced humority, by the performances and the achievement of consumption contained.
And it is that although the most requested Mazda3 will be the disel versions, those who do not perform a high number of kilometres per year should not remove this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both by their high walking comfort and for their consumption.
With respect to the level of equipment, the selected version for test is the name Sportive, which includes a greater number of series elements.
From the series equipment is especially highlighted by the carrier exchange assistant (RVM) who removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive internal speed, board computer on a large size screen, parking sensors, independent climate sensor, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17 pounds of allocation.
Moreover, if it was short of its equipment, this version was accounted for the Pack Premium, which adds for $1.500: adjustive BOSE and BOSE audio system with disk loader, including other items.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best components of the category.
It is particularly highlighted by the quality of the materials employed, by their behavior and by the high level of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not perform a lot of kilometres per year can choose by this i-Stop version, only associated with gasoline 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only inconsistency of this model is its high price, which is located between 21.770 euros from Luxury end and 23.270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
Instead of this high number, Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
Lujo 'Premier'
L. A. covers the red lamp of freedom in the hand of Penélope ́z, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have lightened more than ever involving in elegant models like 'sexys' in the outside of 'Nine'. (Foto: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', so sophisticated as usually, chose by a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without the possibility of seeing some kind of attachments or browser on the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when the Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
In contrast with smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low quantity men â, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
Since the company has succeeded, the company has taken two new devices: one fully thought for Twitter, the other with a free life data service instead of paying six times more for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday in Le Web event, is the European version of invent and its third encarnation.
It's equal to limited as its opposite, but it comes with a surprise.
The maintenance price of approximately 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to refuse data when the border is crossed or unexpectedly search for a WiFi cafeteria (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed roaming is incrediblely attractive and a long time he should be working.
Yes, some operations have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience, a physical doctor needs to understand them and a good wheel to read the little letter.
The repeated ear towns of the European Commission to achieve adequate roaming tariff for all Europe have only had a perceived effect.
Out of the country of origin, there is fear of using data, and reasonably.
So that a FonPeek device (not stops to be interesting that brings the name of Fon when you do not have Wifi) gets this type of tariff means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book trading and other consultations on the Internet.
No contracts and no gates.
It's a connected device and it's paid for it by buying it, not monthly.
And that's what I hope to see a day with FonPeek, a choice of purchase with life access like that Peek has already been in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope it's because I think it's a better model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fat colour
Yellow is, of course, the favorite ton of the first lady and Property.
If he has already arrived to Barack Obama's position as a US president with a clothes and a cover of this color, he has chosen the same to join him in the second important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Prize of the Peace.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model at the two times: besides being a similar -green-ambrillo with reflectants - the acting was two times composed of three pieces - dressed, cut and covered by the same screen, and was adornated with a great border or .
That's how, in a first view, it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the star of the Princess of Asturia and had chosen to repeat clothing.
But the screen in which the two carries are constructed makes them very different.
If for the presence of treatment of a gorgeous encage, in Oslo is a tissue with printed.
The plugins have also changed: green hairs of medium tacoon again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And it is also different: a collection in this case, melene pulls the previous.
75% of the mother's work has had work problems for their motherhood
Discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the youngest generations they want to be mothers.
It thus reveals the study of the "Feedness and Training of Women in Spain", designed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey between 9.737 women from 15 to 75 years is not doubtful about this: 75% of the mothers worked have seen limitations of opportunities in the workshop due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences at the start of partnership and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the kind of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the house, work partly, or have an unstable job, start first with partnership, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
In contrast, women with sustainable employment, mainly in the public sector, turn away with maternity and have less seed.
"The women between 35 and 49 years of fixed work have the first son, average, 3.7 years after starting with responsibility, a number that increases to 4.1 women with physical jobs have needed more time for their vital traictory to gain them, which has led them to impose the union and arrival of children.
Moreover, the working type exercises a lot of influence on maternity, even though less on the calendar of empire," explains the CSIC Margarita Delgado research.
The level of study is one of the factors that differ the age of women when married and having the first wedding.
The question is, how large the educational level is, the age they are married and the first child.
The difference is also maintained between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of 35 to 49 years, those who have elemental and higher studies have been mothers for the first time 25.1 and 32.1 of the average respectively.
"In addition, there is another division between women depending on their level of studies.
While those who have elemental studies are married and have their first child before taking a stable job, the average or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtain stability work as before the marriage and the arrival of a child, says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oreal Paris just summarizes a new name to its invisible list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German actriz will be converted into a picture of different products of the mark, showing the universal lema of 'Because I choose it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actrices of the international panorama, is the same to other famous figures of the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope.
Before her, the last incoming in such a select club was the Evangeline Lilly ('Fires') and Frida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the masculine paragraph, the cosmetic mark also relates to lush embailers: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomia de Grey') and Matthew Fox (congregate of Evangeline in 'Fursts').
British Mode Premies
The British have much to say in the world of mode.
His highest representatives - designers and models, of yesterday and today - gathered together in the annual delivery of their premises, which was celebrated in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed at the meeting.
The ex model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, selected Best Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent gives a thirty-third of writers' radiographs that have passed through their literary life (and, in cases, also by the other).
It doesn't do it in the predictable and fearful genres (biographic, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition nuclear of the creation character.
The travel has his excitings and Vicent does not hurt suits or iluminations.
Besides an exquisite pleasure, the book is a conmove’s invitation to reading and reading.
Here I'll leave you some instincts.
About Albert Camus: "In his page I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulsation, the same thing I felt without giving him a name: the pleasure against the acetic destination, the moral without fault and the innocentness without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, a joyful Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellectual, between impotence and ignorance, with a luminous poetic humor, without sense, like the sheet of the knife that was going to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was abducted by this woman with a tremendous suffering that was thirty years, in which the flesh joined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of the remordyment, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching the heavens to the path of per—."
About James Joyce: "The "Ulises" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters circles of the universe, which must scale through the north wall, from which the best alpinists are once again."
About William Faulkner, "It was a rare guy.
Of course, sometimes he said he was an inheritance of a landholder of the condado and others who were a son of a black and a cocodril.
Both dreams were great."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the cry from a pont by that Munich person to take his echo to the back of the night of the 20th century under his literary form and made it in a way running from himself and calling to the posterity with a violent talk to the guyans."
About Dorothy Parker: "Every day it was putting rounds and repeated, "God, I pray you to stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "About his tube were these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the torment the gate,/ the rest after the war,/ after the harted life pleasure death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the team he also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted all normally that she told her that Eduardo VII spied her between the azars or that the birds sing in Greek.
Never has been given the case of such a patient and loved man of a neurotic whose literary talent was going before his foolishness."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inocular Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to pass Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cel but abduct the fame of that man to serve him of his own pedestal?"
Cobard Agression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years of age passed through our barrier in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of youths between 15 and 18 years passed with her and our dog, an example of massive race, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilograms of weight and, without meaning, two bottles that left the bad dog.
Our indignation is great because we haven't found the divorce in a free agression to a small and undeserved animal, which, in fact, was attracted.
This must be added to the sufocus that caused a lady that passed quietly and that, when he invoked these individuals, it came to fear for her physical integrity, because an energy that attacks a animal is able to do what is right with a woman, a child, an elder, or, finally, with any who is weaker than he himself.
The event occurred at the five of the afternoon of a Wednesday everyone by a traditionally quiet bar.
The dog was crying all day.
In fact, we have made a statement in a near Commissioner that we doubt that it serves for a lot and not to generate susceptibilities, just to declare that the murderers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to declare this fact.
We don't understand that it's happening among youths so that they consider fun to be freely misleaded to an undefend animal that gives us love, companion and friendship.
We don't know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the cake
The Neumatians manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Vial Security Foundation (Fesvial), has made a campaign to promote the use of the cask, mainly among the youngest motorists, reported today.
This initiative seeks to conscious the importance of use of the cask, since it is the only element of protection that can prevent the lesions in the head or, even, death in the case of a accident while it is in motorcycle.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of its commitment with travel security, that "will be beyond designing and manufacturing products every day more safe" and suggested that it would also contribute to this target through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign of promotion of the use of the cask in the motorcycle, under the 'To be or not to be', will have a first stage in which cards will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycles, with the aim of achieving the maximum diffusion.
To end, Michelin highlighted that vial security "is a constant concern" for the company, since when being a neumatian manufacturer for two road vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop more safe products.
Subsequent sale of light trades
Nearly two years later, the market of light commercial vehicles begins to see something light at the end of the tunnel.
9.425 units that were matriculated in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent for 2008 and, as the most important, the first increase after 22 months of decline is the number of Anfac and the sellers of Ganvam.
The good data, not to you, is to put it in quarantine because the reference to which the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% in respect of the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the recurrence of the last month, the matriculations collected in these 11 months are 40% below the previous exercise.
Since January, 95.853 units have been sold all vehicles composing the saster cast of light commercials: tourists derivatives, pick up, cargonetes, light furniture and camions/slight cases.
Moreover, the nubarrons who are more affected by their request have not been disappeared, since although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay almost 100% of external financing cases.
Thus, the restrictions imposing the closed griff of credits must include other factors such as the increase in the levels of pardon or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Before this panorama and in contrast to the tourisms, they have shortly served assistance to buy 2000E.
They can also be attached to individuals, autonomes and pymes that will purchase a light trade of up to 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 level that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been witness.
Yesterday, from Ganvam, they remembered the need to give special attention to these vehicles and to the industry (cabinets and buses).
The sales association pronounces a 2010 compared to the end of the year, which calculates a fall in sales (turisms and 4x4) of 19%.
Aid to the emergency bread is already mandatory
As happened to the ABS anti-blocks and will passe over the ESP stability control, the emergency breeding aid systems must be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, it is already in all light commercial tourisms and vehicles of new matriculation, while for the rest a care period is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, introduced by the European Union, aims to enhance the protection of peatons, even though, in their way of working, can also help to avoid many collisions.
The assistant to the emergency bread is to increase the pressure on the breasts in case of emergency, which the system detects by the piston that gives the driver.
But this does not always keep that pressure until the end.
A study carried out by the Bosch car manufacturer, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the freno before the collision and half of them did not use the whole force.
By 1.100 accidents
Instead, the intervention of the aid requires the maximum frenade system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
The EU's own study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, could be avoided in the year up to 1.100 death accidents in which peatons are involved.
The reduction will be even greater - it is calculated that one of the four insults would be avoided with damage to people - when the called intellectual emergency frenade systems are popular.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that detects the obstacles and warns the driver, as well as acts lightly on the breasts.
If the driver re-reactivates, helps you to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If you do not repeat, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort to minimise damage.
General Motors backed up to January the plan for Opel
While the workers of Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first week of April - the 8th day probably - reports Javier Ortega, the manufacturer, and advertising that it will need more time to complete the repair plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously consented by the parties concerned.
And this can make the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the Governments of the countries in which there are factors will be repeated until the beginning of 2010.
However, from GM it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next days.
This is not strange to what the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the manufacturer and to make a decision as far as before.
GM admits to have contact with some new possible buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also encourages to buy Volvo, but covers the option of the Netherlands Sporting Cars of Skyper, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to Baic China.
The decision to close Saab for a year is maintained if it is not sold.
To the Porsche Boxster Spyder flight
To develop its last, and face joy, Porsche's engineers took the Boxster S as a base and achieved nothing less than 80 kilos, which left the basket in just 75 kilos.
This led them first to prevention from the automotive tissue that was supplied by one of the lone with manual rubbering, with which they were decreasing 21 kg; using aluminium gates like the GT3, 'caen' 15 others; removeing the climateizer, 13; reducing the fuel depth from 64 to 54 litres, they wined 7 kg more; monting sports else 12 and with the layers of 19 pounds, five.
Finally, rejecting to the CDR-30 audio system offered six other kilograms and changing the doors' trainers by one screen, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the double embrage PDK change, the test was performed on a unit with six speed manual box, mainly by secondary roads of California, in mountain traces with actually revised traces
Its behavior can only be qualified of intachable.
The weight reduction doesn't mean that the car doesn't pass the asfalt with aplome.
In contrast, it was a time ago that we did not test a so small and light model that, at the same time, it would have transmitted so much security in the course of curve, even to high speeds.
It's a little athlete, able to calm his muscles in a short walk during the time necessary, until we order him to print, to breathe, to recover and again express his engine...
What we ask you, thanks to your direction, as communicative as necessary, what we indicate with our hands in the flight is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a chirurgical precision.
Voluntary Engine Sound
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and it can be powered with the "sport" option and → a system that changes the engine brake, already stretched in the Panama.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, already from stop or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asfalt of the roads we passed through with the Boxster Spyder was very punished, but the car cut the bags well.
Electronic aid just made an act of presence in all the tray; and that in some of the curves we find ice in the morning and gravity, well in the morning.
Finally, a ultra-league car, of the most funny to drive that one can on the market and that is something more than a simple change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of EUR 70.831.
'Small Small'
Intima of Karl lagerfeld, the image of Coco Cocoon line and 'starlet' of the 'maison' defiles, the song prodigates his face of evil with so much contumacy and Chanel's balls.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a Big Girl'.
Basconia is given a victory in Israel
The Laboral Caja reached a 82-91 trionfo at its visit to the complicated cank of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous lowers with which the team of Dusko Ivanovic was in the leadership of his group, after the great action of Mirza Teletovic, which with eight triples announced was the best of its team (29 values).
The victory team was supposed to supplie the significant absenties of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with great dose of implication and collective work, although he had to suffer until the end to make it with the victory.
Moreover, the great accent from the perimeter, with 16 triple noted, had much to see in the final triumph.
The party eats of face to the azards, which were placed from the start in front of the marker.
That the four first Canasites of the victory were from the perimeter had already made preagiar that they had springed to the Israeli cancer with the warm munks.
English and Teletovic were the main artists of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more than the same, but the alave team chose for the inner game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pits and applauses in the return to his home, to continue expanding its benefit to rest (34-43).
Teletovic had already started to be highlighted as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 's less than six 'valuation had already assumed that he wouldn't be the best night of Brazil.
But the party, despite being incarryed in the rest, was not very less determined and the macabeans wanted to remember the victories that in his cancer doesn't win any, and with 'the hand of Elias' they were able to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini were determined to contribute to the 'marillas' to the Â’’s return (50-49).
More Inconventive
Ivanovic's, wounded but not less dead, needed to hire a couple of games accurately to cover air, and in these it reached Mirza Teletovic's ametralla, which with three triples almost consequent and the English and Ribas' aid returned the marker to a peaceable rent (54-67), which could make the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alaves went out to leave the skin in the last part of the English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone remove what was deserved for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team were not resigned and held their team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite that, and with Splitter removed by missing, Ivanovic's people were not predicted, defended well, and even though the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the party had already owner and the victory was running from Tel A ։
Unicaja's lesions are unexpected.
The Unicaja was extremely lost in Greece before the Olympics and sent him the leader of the Group B of the Euroliga, in a party marked by the bass of the casts, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malean team was not afraid of the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Amistad and also of the rival, perhaps of the most powerful Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the sandwich to dream. A aggressive defense and three triples followed, two of the Omar Cook base and one of Guillem Rubio, distorted the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos saw surprised by the Unicaja intensity, although the arsenal of the locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave him the return to the markup 22-20, minute 13, while a action, battle conceived, between the two bases and the Beverley and Williams, assumed the decalization of both players.
The Greek whole eats to work by showing its superiority within both areas, where the lowness by lease of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal deficiencies of Carlos Jiménez were lacking the cachs.
Among the internal players and the Lithuanian alert Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the benefit 44-32, minute 19.
Unable to mount
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacs, which, despite the 19 losses, was higher and even complicated to compare the difference in the meeting discussed in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the leadership of the group.
The Unicaja overlooked the absents and the last low of the Scotch pivot Robert Archibald, lesioned during the meeting.
Despite all inconvenients, the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' admission, left something of hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was almost impossible because the Olympiacs, when he applauded and given its superiority in centimeters within the area, appeared inevitable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, was able to remont the basket average 81-62, a minute 37, and the Unicaja disappeared, delivering the leader to Olympiacos.

Brazil sets date to Zelaya output
The Brazilian Government has laid a term for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its campaign in Tegucigalpa.
The President shall leave the diplomatic commitment by 27 January 2010, when the mandate was officially completed.
Francisco Catunda, charged by Brazil's campaign in the Honduras capital, confirmed the Globo TV that "Mel" knows that it must be out before that date of the ambassador, where it remains reserved since September 21.
"He has a conscience that he has to go out on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, he has to seek another destination."
It also cited the former mandatary, who confirmed its intention to exit the campaign before the appointed time: "My position is to go out as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazil government," Zelaya stated via telephone.
After the elections of November 29 (in which the porfirio Lobo election) Zelaya assured that it would remain in the Brazilian embailed until January.
However, this same week he tried to find a reality in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by the Zelaya's appealing with the political asylum that was intended to impose the "fair" Government of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and rose from the primary past where the inflation of assets has been the dominant tonic on the markets, the uncertainty again appears on the markets, which should not be surprised because it is its natural state, in a environment where agents take decisions on the future for incertain nature.
The medication used by central staff to stabilise markets was monetating debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving free liquidity bar to types nearby zero so that the financial assets purchased actives to disregard.
Central holdings have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically been completed and, without questioning their liquidity policy, they begin to put some sand in the borders how the ECB has done with its submarine annually in the next week.
The investors thus doubt about the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such hitherodox measures, and we are assisting a reverse of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatilities of the Bolsas and the differences of the good corporates have turned to recall, although they are still very remote from the paranormal levels reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been binding to socialize private risks and the public debt returns to the affected verse.
There is a flight to the quality again, and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the re-elected by investors, providing an extension of the differences in the Eurozone countries in respect of Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this instability episode, but in that it reached Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision to the lower ratification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, something of uncertainty is not wrong to rebuild the defensors of the moral risk that rebuild consciousness on the responsibles of the world economic policy because of the destruction effects resulting from the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, where what should be done is to determine a new day of Thanksgiving action.
However, Dubai thinks about a tribal fight between the emirs to recompense the power in the emirates and Greece's already seen it before.
A Government who hides public deficit, elections and a new Government that takes the hand.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not mean that the Ecofin will be saved to Hungary from an incomplete of its external payments at the beginning of the year and will allow a Member State of the euro to fail its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public funds.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves before a normalization episode of the transitional risk premiums, after some places falling in, it would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt increase the same as the good European corporates should not be concerned.
If European differences decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrosis risk.
The standard & Poor's is an annuity. When our advanced indicators are obligating the majority of studies to predict their recovery scenarios and to revise their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the load with a Japanese scenario for Spanish economy, there is no longer a life hope for their warning.
Again, it has all the pint that will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish actives, even though now "providence, friend conductor".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene in yesterday before the subcommittee of the Members' Congress in which the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in the next two deities.
After his intervention, which followed the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few penetrates of what he had put in the subcommittee to closed door.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and 60,000 million from that date to 2030, unless nuclear centers are open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Yes, Iberdrola considers that investments should not be intended to increase the capacity in generation but in distribution networks and international interconnections
Since 2020, the issue changes and will have to increase power.
It focuses both on gas and carbon plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, in particular, renewable energy.
In this case, it believes that there are 18,000 new MW, that is, with other "support energy".
Galan, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Law, which just adopted the Government, is online with what its company has come to claim, did not want to make blood with the real decree to invoke national carbon consumption, which contrarys the climate change policies.
In its opinion, there is "a long-term claim" in this regard, despite "puntual measures", as the President of Iberdrola named them.
Anyway, Galan considers that investment decisions, although long-term, should be started to take because they are lately mature, and it is necessary a stability retributional framework to overcome them.

A strategy followed by Hochtief or Bilfinger, as well as Asian references, which continues to be adequate assignment for Spanish Giganten in the sector.
Only S has achieved a position on that market from its participation of 30% in Hochtief, ownership of the Leighton.

Many of 63 million in France Télécom for competition
The Competition regulator in France has imposed a bank of 63 million euros to France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
This institution has limited the competition in fixed and mobile phone with the signing of agreements, price plans and faithfulness programmes to consumers at the border of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopolie and still a state company collected more than 560 million euros in charge since 1994 by putting work to their competitors.

Playing the Champions has reported 476,4 million to Madrid and Barça from its origin
The Campeons Liga has become a source of income for clubs since he was born in 1992.
So, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476,4 million since then, which has become them in the third and fifth club, which most money have won in competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
To win the EUFA Campeons Liga does not only provide glory; it is also one of the main income sources of the major clubs.
Thus, competition has divided 5.362,5 million euros to 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the turnover was created in the period 1992/1993, EUFA data.
The Real Madrid and the F. C. Barcelona have been well stopped from this department.
The white club has been the third of the continent which most money has been refunded by participating, and the only, at Milan, who has won three times the trofeo.
The catalán, the current campaign and the last winner of Europe's extinction Copa in 1992 is the fifth of the classification.
The list leads Manchester United and the Bayern of Múnich, the two teams that also make more money to participate in the past Campeons Liga.
And that, despite both faces the Christmas.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money in the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This paradox is explained by the complicated money distribution procedure applied by the EUFA.
For this exercise, the body president of Michel Platini intends to enter 1.090 million by Champions League.
From these money, EUFA will dedicate 413,1 million for the fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous classification round (including the Atletic of Madrid) received 2.5 million.
Moreover, those who had been able to participate received 3.8 million only because they were available, as well as 55.000 euros for each party they were disputed.
There are also bonuses to win (800,000 euros) and empathy (400,000 for each team). Octavofinalistes will receive three million each; eight quartofinalistes, 3.3 million.
The last four will evaluate 4 million each.
The campaign will win 9 million, before 5,2 million of the finalists.
Thus, in conception of fair payments, a club will enter at least 7,1 million, and a maximum of 31,2 million.
The Barza, on the other hand, was 2.5 million to win the Supercope of Europe in August.
But it is that there are also different payments, which are 337,8 million.
This money is distributed is the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is of the main, and accounts with four assigned places.
The previous year's campaign remains with 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the quarter.
The other party shall be paid to the number of games that are played in this year and.
New Romania offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group decreased the details of the purchasing offer of action with which it would continue to buy a top between 25% and 29.9% of the Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force you to launch a public offer of acquisition (opa) by the whole of the titles.
In particular, New Romania offers 1,5025 euros for action that would be deployed in 10 years and that would be paid with an interest for the amount of 1% of the year
Sos' actions were closed to 1,85 euros yesterday, so the New Rumania's offer values the company under the market by 18%.
See New Romania, the price of 1,50 euros reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned to the designation of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerezan group gives a 15-day period to communicate their interest in sale of titles.
The CNMV has not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos' company noticed that he had contacted the regulator.

It is a new creation position that will depend directly on the President of the Group.
And it is not excluded from polemic, since the company continues to be involved in the legal battle by the assumed discharge of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it can not be rejected that in the next months the new funds delays

New tools to lose cars
In these days of time and accidents, they won not only car rentals.
Each day, thousands of cars who have suffered a coach are lost up to a taller, where a expert should evaluate the suffering damage and what will be the cost of repair.
No factor is equal, and the calculation of the costs of parts and the time of work can be a long and complicated work.
Manually, the cost of a repair between 200,000 and 300,000 euros, including workshops, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the most recent infrastructure tools, it would be a few minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of the experts use this type of systems.
The providers of services and solutions for currency evaluation and maintenance are dedicated to collect the information provided by manufacturers, to then draw it up and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Solera group, is the leader sign; 80% of the assessments are made with their products.
The other signatures complying with the field of the information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is very simple.
See Eduardo Velázquez, a commercial director of Audatex, works with 63 manufacturers and importers in Spain, and each of them provides information in different formats.
Moreover, the number of data to be treated does not stop to increase, until the point that in the last five years there have been launched six versions, variants of imotorization as in the previous fifty years.
As a new car comes out to the market, these companies are working.
It's a very hard work, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must catalogue and introduce its price.
Furthermore, each model is made a "intelligent" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "pinched".
If it's a ventamassive model, the work can be ready in a week if the process is very quick.
If it is a small car, it can be late for three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information about 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most models there are information about Porsche, but not from Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As regards the mobile park, they're over 99%.
To carry out the documentation and processing of the databases, Audatex accounts for eight worldwide centres (Spania, France, Germany, United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them is specialized in specific marks.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than hundred technical (normally mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the elaboration of these databases.
Each month 2,5 million data are included, and customers receive updates each two days.
The elaboration of this huge information flow allows these companies to provide different uses and to offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but in which countries there are also tools for the management of parts of disturbance or to calculate the value of a car.
The only company that has a guide to inform the value of the users in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it's in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to make an idea of the type of support that can provide the professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the AudaPlus star product, the standard solution for the valuation of kinestres, intended for experts.
It includes light or heavy industrial vehicles, motors and vehicles.
Besides the cost of the pieces, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or painting bars.
This tool is paid for use, for each assessment.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for customers who use it shortly, a maximum of ten times a month.
After each secure company, which makes thousands of experiences, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the mount line only with its number of bastards.
AudaGlass is focused on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the Internet professional sector that allows the vehicles to be able to be able to be able to carry up by the totally declared higher.
Your statistical service is very useful to identify trends, to perform geodemographic analyses or to identify deviations by homodele marks.
For example, it can be studied how many models of a mark have passed by the boarder due to advice or how serious thermal have suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Commercialize, among other things, Gt estimate, which is also intended to the experts and also provide digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group based in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, furniture or maintenance of the car
The Gt Tax Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in boards, 3.100 experts and 53 secure companies.
