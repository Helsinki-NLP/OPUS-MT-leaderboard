No free Novelle for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament has today refused to reject the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposite leader Yulia Timoshenko was condemned under a Novelle of the penalty book.
The re-revision that would have been able to make the way to release the arrested expert minister, the ladies refused to read the second reading of the request for mildness of the penalties for economic delegates.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October because of the conclusion of an approximately negative contract with Russia on the acquisition of landgas for seven years.
The sentence is not yet legal, in December it is to be negotiated the profession of the sentences before the court.
Timoshenko himself dealt with the judgment as a political decree of the Regime and also in the Western the process made the decree of the presence of the Court.
The request for paragraph 365, on the basis of which the expert minister was condemned to remove from the penalty book, was supported by 147 deputy.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libysk Vig
The history of the Libyan Liberation War or Libyan Rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the wilderness and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
Like this region usually, victory in the elections of Islamists, the question is only what - the fashioned or radical.
The National Transitional Council takes place to the right of normality of Sharija, of which you now have a certain view of God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for the deep steel, the hand is quickly cut off.
Women should also forget thinking of Eman's employment as soon as possible, and so further.
Instead of a single dictator, the company will be given from the Coran from the stages of each other.
Shortly - in Libya, there will be a order that would be unlikely and especially unnecessary.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen, not even the best, and the difference would never match the dead libyrs.
So it is more comforting that the Moslem fighters have been helped by the unbelieving dogs.
For their excuse, it is only possible to serve the fact that the NATO air attacks were not by any general from America but by God himself, whose Almighty has been praised after every match.
The winners in Libya? The west doesn't belong to it.
We only shared in a shift, served the interests of the Islam and our members were involved in the person of the dictator of a political union without any benefit.
According to the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefered to look away from a military occupation of Libyans.
This causes the hiesigens to be anxious, namely the detriment of the crossways.
But do the mineral oil enterprises also receive the black gold to the spot price without occupation?
In fact, the western can finally glorify the right of his selflessness in matters of protection of human rights.
If they don't destroy this, the Shari'a representatives.
Start a new crisis era
France and Europe's focus on investors.
On Wednesday, a statistical depth took place through Europe.

The Czech qualities were made for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The choice of football has made the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a good recorded Torwarts Czech and a glorious port of Petr Jiráček, she won at Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of happiness, the Czech football could so protect its luxeous prospect from the home game and will not again fall in the European Mastership.
IHNED.cz followed the growth game in an extra reporting.
Weight exciting in the first half-time and a rice-reporting happiness in the second.
The Czech election also sees thanks to the closure of the homemanship, a chambering Chech's and the herd of the day Jiráček in Montenegro: 1:0 and thus solve her ticket for the football-EM.
Moreover, because of the precise defence game of the Czech community, they are pressing the Montenegros only in the second half-time.
The pech birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic who destroyed two riesencans.
In addition, thanks to a excellent Petr Czech, the Czech election will be mixed next year to the European Masterships, it is also happy that the home football is added to a premium of approximately 200 million.
From the first minute, the football has been played very strictly.
Both communities were combined long-termly and so was played in particular around the middle line.
Moreover, in the second half-time, the pressure of the household remained and the white delays before the straf was rejected by the Czech Republic.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They made a living gun.
Some hundreds of high school students formed a living gun around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's nuclear programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed on Wednesday before the object and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students of the University in Iranian Isfahan, on Sunday, formed a living shield around the nuclear area in Isfahan, where Uran will be formed.
They wanted to realize that they were ready to spend their country's nuclear programme, if it was necessary for their own life.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recently stated in its report that Iran has not seemed to be given to his efforts for a nuclear weapons long.
In Israel, it also refers to a possible attack on Iranian nuclear arrangements.
Students had prayed before the income of the complex and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack in the aim of putting the Iranian atom programme largely lahm, the Israelian pressure would also be the atomic installation in the Natan attack target.
The feed card of a fatful child: it doesn't eat and eat to dinner bread wrest
More than one third of the children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, including 9% of all students and 5% of all children.
Current question - Adipous Children are most of families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
So it is again shown how important it is for the healthy development of a man the environment in which he is raised and the examples that circumcide him.
At the tables of adipous children, workshops are more frequently on the table than in families where normal weight children live.
More than 19% of the overweight children had on the morning of the discovery action under the Motto "Adiezzas is not a case" Pommes for the evening bread.
In families with dickerchen, the sport is also not exactly related to the loving jobs, but the majority of today's students - only 15% answered that their parents were at least once in the weekly time for active movement.
Question under 900 children
The survey was found last year at the end of the school year, and nearly 900 children were asked from basic schools in the whole Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the action "Adiovás" is not a case, which is supported by the general hospital and the Unilever Society.
Thursday, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes were shared in the project.
Unhealthy costs and failure movement in the family are decided to be responsible for the terrible number of children with overweight or even fever.
"Only the help of the requested children, for example, led to five times a day to eat in the early-two-year-feed bread - one of the main conditions for a healthy nutrition," is one of the results of the investigation.
No breakfast and worst for dinner bread
Experts indicate that relative minorities, such as the regular breakfast of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
But in Czechland only 23 per of the family of the students.
And - in most families, everyone is first to be alone.
The most worst was the determination that is not attracted in any family.
The breakfast applies to it as a basic stone of the healthy daily food.
The test of investigation included the day that overweight children in the families are consumed much more unhealthy pommes.
And almost every - without regard to weight - drinks sweet limonades every day (70 Pro).
More than 40% of the children asked Sports, but only less than the help of their parents do that - not only 15%.
Compose your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to collect their own food plans from offered opportunities after appetit and opinion.
"What the Czech Children prefer between 12 and 15 in Point Ernä, is far away from the idea of a healthy nutrition.
Under their favorite vessels there were many meals, meat-oriented and natural sweet wheat.
"Alarming is, in particular, the great delight of sweet limonades," is stated in the final report on this investigation.
At midnight, so the main court, the tissues were seen nearly before flights.
Coal fruits were almost not like the children, as well as the property of fish and vegetables was very low as the middays.
Others to health
At the same time, the question also showed that the children are ready to change their habits if they receive proper information.
"In the control group of enquêting participants, which were subject to the questionnaire after the conclusion of the "Adiezzas is not a case", in many cases, a clear diffusion of the preferences was given to the principles of healthy food," it was stated in the results of the project.
This, for example, was in the sweet Limos, where many children started giving the priority to usual water.
The children also crossed in the questionboat a lot of fresh birds or fish as the main court of the day and were ready to eat less novels or sweet foods.
Appreciate Profis - a stylist must also be a good psychology
In the beginning article about how to learn stylists, I had a little cluster that it was a little too much substance for the beginning.
I didn't know what else happened.
Proposals of three Professors from the Branch, clothing of problems and a seminar about how it works on the place.
It's gonna be worse.
More closer is the test, so more information and practical tasks are before us.
But even if the course is located every Sunday and Sunday, it is still complete.
This time, we discussed with Directora Alena (in the course no one is part of) as a woman who has no ideally proportionate figure.
And that's always the most of us.
They have one too short hair, the other one too young without ordinary curves and others are molly.
It's a thing of the stylist to optically cut the width wallets, to extend the hair or to raise the needed curves.
We also received tips of a woman type such as Jennifer Lopez - so with a large bus, a wide hair and a smal size - beautiful and figural beton, without that it works too provocating.
For example, if the subsequence between sizes and sticks is so large that the rock or the rock really doesn't match, at least a piece should be cut into measure.
This will certainly not be disgraced, because well-seeding clothing is simply unpaidable.
In such a measured rock, you feel much better than in one of the stones that always is too high and disturbed, in the size, etc.
Young figures can be allowed again to cloth with falts, buildings, apps, sticks or raffle.
In these many information and types of figures, I am glad I have a whole week of time to leave all things basically through my head.
Yet, I have concluded that it is almost not to be created in view of the open home task.
Each of the shareholders received a promium for which it was to deal with the outfits - day clothing and abdomen.
We should consider the current look, the style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I'm going to "attract Miranda Kerr" which you may know from the Victoria's secret campaign.
In the middle of me, it is a lot better for me, for example, to draw Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently increased to the hundreds of kilo (which well, it's a little overcome), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the clothes out of magazines or search on the Internet, printing, and then editing graphically.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our entire personal style and our relationship with the graphical design will be expressed.
It is, in fact, very important to think about the graphical side of the styling.
The style list is not only pure physically, but also designed the product page as referred to in the journals (by specific default, for example, trend hands, mantels, etc.).
Davon told us the Stylist and Designer Mario Kamenik.
But that's the first Sunday.
That means a style list must have a good overview.
The Saturday Act, which was provided by information on types of figures, was the same by three of the bodies from the branch:
by the stylist Jan Pokorny, by the Creator of Jakub Polanka and by the photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that it is illusion and that it should be a stylist to use this.
And inhibited stylists can work with one single clothing piece in a very different way.
The tuberculosis calls variability.
For example, you can take a trenchcoat as habited over the Jeans, so like a T-shirt or a mantel, but you can also draw it on the naked body, the shadow and the clothes.
It's enough to cross the arms or the forces, and the whole look looks very different.
"Speaking with," he insisted.
In most cases, I had the following advice: "You must first know the rules perfectly."
"Then you will be able to lose them," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why all of these teachings should be considered, what you can associate with, and why, even if you often see all other things in journals.
It's too weak from looking.
Thanks to the photograph Ben, I now know that a styllist has to have prepared much more clothing than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with → pages (sprich → Outfits) to hold at least five.
And also that clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories seems very different than in reality.
So all of this must be considered in the design of the outfit.
That image and style below the help of the success, which also affected us Jan Pokorny.
So only once Madonna had to look at an unclean songman who had made a world star from the image and marketing.
In Czechland, the service of a stylist is better reserved.
In addition to personalities, this often holds out for outdoor money (the main thing is that I bring something, as I look out, is second-range).
And if any of us is already allowed, we should consider that he or she, with great probability, forces us a very different (small) size than he or she actually takes it.
Then you need to go up only to make sure that the boulevard press is writing, the corresponding promie has re-advanced or removed, etc.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist is focusing on the face and then the output "construct".
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he has and must be a different psychology.
People appreciate without being offered and standing in their opinion.
"If any manager commands us to see their clothes and to add beautiful things, we can't eat her all the pain and say, "My God, that's a terrible thing."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things that are recommended to what you can do to it," said Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what must include such a "play box".
So a box that is attached to the size and in which all necessary properties are available.
Besides such clear things, such as scarlets, scarlets for hair dilution or safety nails, it also contains outensiles such as a nylon fade (which helps the style when photographing products, such as hands or sticks), special clips, with which the clothes are drawn behind, if it is too large (stocknacks or other clothes are subjected to the substance so that the substance doesn't go) and, naturally, the neighbor.
But not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to understood the shadow rightly.
Even when photographing in the atelier, where the footland is below, you can fix the shooter, wear the outside.
We're closing and closing...
You can't even touch the shadow so that you can't protect it.
So you really have to go forward.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
This is not just my strength.
All this was only the breaking of what we heard at the second week-continuation course.
One has become clear between me - to share the styling at a professional level, it is not a child game.
V Need for Speed: "The" - the illegal running thatr through America
Residence
The originally unseen trip will be a series of completely preventive, dilettant errors for the roundway to the morning.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large part, what does this benefit if no one obviously wanted to do a little more.
Before he came to the Ladentic, the new part wake up with the subtitle "The" high expectations.
But he promised the old player 'Need for Speed' to move a track again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not only one of many action-rein games.
We were also interesting in how the passports fall in which the main protagonist goes out of the car and goes to the foot.
But as you're already used in NFS, there's a lot different in the end than you've expected.
Certainly - potentially it's adequate arcade rounds, but in total the game of some overflow errors that are present in this series for more or less than a few years.
So there are no errors anymore, but more signs of one in the principle inconscient failure of the player developers.
The aventure starts very well.
The first time you are introduced into the history, whose main figure Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be shared in an illegal trend or through America.
In San Francisco, so at the West Coast, you are sitting at the Lenkrad - with the task to be first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole range of interesting elements.
The whole road is divided in → stages and in more than fifty individual rounds.
This means that each round will be exhausted on other streams and that the individual stages will be located in a different, quite different and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment to imagine that the game would always offer the same again.
Some environments are still nicely expressed, although the technical level of the graphics is not over the previous parts of the series.
So there's no world movement.
But the road through the wilderness, through the vast landscape or upward by the deep-breaked landscape is visiblely very appreciated.
In and back, untypical elements bring a little difference in the individual runs.
For example, in the wilderness, a desert storm is surprised that restricts the view.
In the mountains again, you need to be careful that you don't be cut off by a lavine.
On the other hand, the rounds are very well built behind each other.
Just a few, but they're getting.
Sometimes you are trying to overcome the previous number of enemies (in Prince a classic round), then you have time to recover (classic rounds against the stoppower), then you expect another personal dull with one single contractor.
And that's what the police wants to mask the whole thing.
A news is passports where Jack leaves the car.
It is better about some interactive animals where Jack flys before someone and where the player needs to help him by using the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it surprises that there is much less of such passports in the game than you would expect (concert only three).
Finally, this thing is better to benefit, because this element has at least no chance to be long - it belongs to the elements that make the game more different.
The vehicle model runs into the footprints of the past parts.
This means, from today's point, although there is no trees out, otherwise, you could not say that it would be bad.
Whoever looks for realistic simulations must be looked differently.
However, an action-loaded roadway will continue to be well justified, although you can find better in competition.
That's the best thing.
Real problems are just to get up after a certain time.
In contrast to the vehicle model, the collection model is not completely OK.
From a game of this kind it is not expected to calculate complicated deform and collisions, but if you practically do not have any idea of how the car is, it is obviously not all right.
Typical example: When you get along or pre-travel on the cars that occur, you are "streaming" in some places, you are just easier to the other cars, but in other, nearly identical situation, you come into the lighters and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car is just going to shoot.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't mean anything, it's always terrible.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land alongside the streak, then a game will return to the last place of the streams.
Only - in every run, you have only five restarts.
If you're getting out of it, everything's going out of the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, for the case that something doesn't work, but it's better not to leave.
But sometimes, not even the restart, there is nothing other than learning the critical section from the head.
Speaking is unappreciated that the same things are often in the same places.
For example, some curves must be conducted in a very specific way, elsewhere you simply do not pass through.
Otherwise, "civil" cars are always in the corresponding place in the same configuration, unless you come as the first or five, five seconds before or a minute later.
This is especially dangerous in situations when you see that the contractant is going before a playing to two autos, but until it comes, the cars are already in a position that you need to kill or breath them.
And it doesn't matter when you come there, everything is so conceived that it always comes close to this situation before your nose.
The contractors have further advantages.
In the entire game, there are some places where you always are overtaken at the same place from the same enemy and here again without regard to the time.
In the most crazy test this is to finish the game on the long bridges that you're doing in opposite.
The contrast must obviously overcome one here on the Devil.
And if he's once before one, he's naturally taking a look at one, so the car begins to run a few times in a clomp.
Of course - you want to make the game just stressing and upset, but this purpose is so clear that it misss a quickly joy in the game.
And this is damage, because, despite a simpleer model, the game is totally sustainable and, of course, also such action loaded that you almost don't know where one of the heads is.
And in Prince, it doesn't matter what is "faith" - the concept of fifty unilateral rounds, the order of running in a way that no longer time can come, or something else else...
An unusual idea is also the car change during the running.
You can't oversee the tanks on the streak, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases, the car you have just enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suitable for the urban areas, the strong `anan' limousin for just cars and exotic super-sport cars for the technical vehicles, such as the Serpentines in the mountain.
Manually with the game history mode is also the task mode (demands) - so the running in the individual locations you know from the history.
There are not only medals but also experience points for the own profile that are common for tasks (demands) and history.
To reach the driving level, various items must be included: start from the car to the background of the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the online function Autolog, including the own results achieved with which other players are compared and also provide for further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensive snares is a situation in the last run of history.
Here you come with the car in a U-Bahn tunnel, where you are in the darkness of the shines (menetways).
The tacho looks at the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (minuteway), but once a U-boat comes from behind and leads an uncompromissed shot.
In our editor, we will still fight about whether it was a Blackout of the player or whether the authors would keep us so bloody.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual general impression is rightly responsible in most cases and here and even there.
It is also worse that at some stressing moments the photo-frequency will be slower, and this is very dramaticly.
This, however, refers particularly to accidents with greater number of shareholders, where there is no use of a continuous FPS.
The sound player is as well as OK, and the sound track is a shirt.
In trying to talk to a widely possible scale of young publics as well, a Soundtrack a la "from any thing" - but who buyes such a game already because of music?
The total impression of Need for Speed: The Â? The feelings are better mixed.
If the game wouldn't be broken by the totally unnecessary errors, we would have been able to assume with the brustton of conviction that The ́ is the best part of NFS in the last years.
But that's how the game doesn't work anyway.
A class of pleasure for you, but you should be prepared to make one of these mistakes with the power of aircraft showers in the eyes.

EU-Botschafterin Vicenová:
The Czechs have the call of negativists and euro skeptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the equality among the individual institutions feelable out of Lot."
I wouldn't have expected that such a hard war would burn."
"It will last five, six years until the villages are stumbled and all have been used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech Messenger in the Union, started to close their proposal to the jurist faculty.
How seriously it takes the "Comprehensive and openly on Europe" motion, it has already shown in the first part of its proposal, in which it was possible to describe individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a transparent and comprehensive way that they could use so many lectors of the legal faculty of Karls University.
Mrs. Vicenová also praised the new continuous president of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism was sounded that he was too inevitable - a cruel employer who wasn't wakened in such a role, but I have to say that it has destroyed all the spirit as well he has accepted the matter.
"He is a man who has done to listen patiently to the twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them and, in particular, has clear ideas of how to continue with the EU.
The new position of High Representative for External Affairs and Security Policy explained it as an answer to the question: Who is the European Union? What number should I call?", so as an important step to agree and improve the readability of EU policies to States such as China or India.
No one wants to prohibit us our oilmaster Quargel
Mrs. Vicenová also addressed the agenda which the European Union lived to remember and in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago was successful.
The Czechs would have developed the financial crisis and the gaps and also the impact of the Eastern Partnership.
The case of the Government during the Presidency was a great negative thing that had highly deceived the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has to make all hands full.
With the words of the proclaimer, it was not only in the president but also in the next crisis that has not yet been overcome until today.
And there must be yet seven-year-old budget of the EU, which makes this thing much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether there will be a slight and slow budget, which will receive the economic priority, which countries will be more and less promoted - all this is now on the agenda.
The newspaper also reminds her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels, "Comprehensively about Europe."
"If I don't like anything, then there's great shortcuts, foreign words, and fachjargon that no one understands.
How should I know as a citizen if you really are crazy or surrounded in Brussels and think about different large bananas or whether somebody really wants to interfere with us?
It would also like to use the EU's ground to get more cheque in institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU partners, the Czechs are calling for euro skeptics, which are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of the Czech in European institutions is also worse.
There are many responsibility, including the maintenance of our candidates, whose incapacity is to write motivation letters and not lately also the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the Czech Presidency, they also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which also showed V4.
"Create me when a Poland or Hungary comes to me and a Slovak is near me, then the French says, "He, what are you standing there - is this your V4 again?" and then makes a pretty sad mine.
According to Mrs. Vicenové, the EU expects in the future, in particular, hard rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As much more real than a "federing" she views the concept of a Europe of two or very different speeds.
"We have the Eurozone countries and the countries of the Eurozone without the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen space and we already have the institution of a strengthened cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries who want it and those who don't want it should be unnecessary."
"There will be more and more of such institutions, which finally run out to a strong "Europe of various speeds", expects Mrs. Vicenová.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, as a result of all the issues with effect on the entire EU by all Member States and not only by the countries of the Eurozone.
Brand history:
The IBM innovationer comes into its existence in the second century
If you want to search for a compliant word that the IBM's characteristics are most precisely, then this would be the word "Live Equity".
For the wide public, IBM is the synonym for Technology Revolution, it is known as modern company, although since its creation has expired a century.
The basis for this long-life has already set her first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
When he had deceived the Slogan, many worldwide problems were easy to solve if people were ready to think a little.
His Slogan "Pense!" was as a sign to play the life of the future gigant (and at the same time the title of the firm internal magazine that has been published in 1935 in IBM).
This was also the foundation of the primarily prepared enterprise culture of Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore a whole century, because it remained faithful to his princess and did not fear to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we will create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company from Jubilea.
Transparent system
Watson has already been working in the thirty years of social care of his employees - in a similar way as the undertaking Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM-leutes had a vacation paid as one of the first employees, a security by the employee plus elegant uniforms as a clothing of work and an overdue remuneration system for best newers and employees.
The long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are also claimed.
The company was from the beginning to genial in the talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide raised any discrimination - and thus was able to decide accordingly.
In accordance with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will be changed by a woman in the next year - by Virginia Rometty.
It is already 30 years in the IBM, until she took the position of the Vedrifts, Marketing and .
IBM has so-called online braintorming in recent years, from which many future and innovative growth.
No wonders - there are enough ideas, there are almost half million people in the company.
An institution with a call
Your unfair position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution than a simply technology undertaking," economicist said the Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not technology undertakings, but a company helping business problems with technology," added George Colony from Consulting-Firma Forrester Research.
As the undertaking itself points out, it is a subsequent subsequence to be only present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logos because of "Big Blue" - has been raised to one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most lateral technological enterprises - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nano.
From all technology undertakings IBM, most patents and five of his employees have been exposed to the nobel price.
Its best findings belong to, for example, bank cars, credit cards, financial weapons, strike codes or diskettes.
With approximately 220 billion billion Börsen value (marketing capitalisation) IBM was the second largest technological undertakings (as Apple), which first took Microsoft over since 1996.
The front row
Not all products and innovatives faced the customers' shame of today - unfortunately, for example, the temptation with the own operating system OS/2, the online serie Prodigy or also the IBM PC jr computers.
"Business based on the pre-term movement, so you can't be emotional to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem to build its base walls on various platforms - and if they do not work, they will also leave them again.
In contrast to the opposer Microsoft, which is in Prince with Windows's operating system and falls.
Successfully promised technologies
IBM's wins are largely shared in services, software and hardware to each five.
In 1990, hardware was represented by more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has exposed little profitable activity in the value of 15 billion, but at the same time it has invested 58 billion in future technologies.
In these investments, the IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis was the first time as a storm over the world.
In addition, IBM remained faithful to his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment range in the middle of the world economic crisis.
It seems that the IBM undertaking does not exceed today’s crisis.
The value of the IBM actions has increased in 120% since 2008 and the rental wines of the company continually.
The company log of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values are not.
It is also possible to be expected that this flexible gigant also meet the next crisis.
IBM story: From the boxes to the world's flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a hundred years ago had first a very complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name of IBM was adopted only in 1924 - earlier, it was a mark name for a delay in Canada and South America.
The basic stone to the later company of IBM laid the fusion of four companies, whose story was returned to the 80s of the 19th century.
They set technology, for example, the famous stack card hours to register the start and end of work.
To the architects of this new company, Charles Ranlett Flint, who also had the president in the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who set up the Chief of the Competition of Thomas J. Watson to help him in the management of the company.
This Leader, then, even the foundations of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to this day the unseenable culture and employment of the company.
Watson led the company to 1952.
IBM, as already delivered by the name, began with the manufacture and destruction of all possible machines for trade - from wrest- and coast-snippers to go to cass.
In the first four years in which Watson led the company, he doubled their conversions to nine million and the company expanded after and after all continents.
Watson was so unfortunate for the company that he was sitting in the Chefsessel for 40 years, first then he was solved by a son, Thomas Watson Junior.
In its direction, IBM began to work in the development of artistic intellectuality and developed the first programmers.
In the 60s, the technicians and computers of IBM of NASA helped to lead flights to all - to the mercury and Saturn and in 1969 the famous human flight to the month.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM system/360.
A classic PC that sets the computer standard at that time came on the market in 1981 with the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM issued its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but, on the other hand, she bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and increased completely in the business of consultations and services with higher value.
The term that IBM is paid in the last three years is the concept "Smarter Planet".
It is encouraging to use technologies in wise areas that are not planned until now, for example, to improve the situation in the Force and in the town management.
In the trade sector, IBM lately introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help the operators lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong story in Czechland.
In 1932, IBM found a decrease in the Czech Slovakia at the same time as the first country in Central and East Europe.
Today, IBM ČR includes a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The Central Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and here is also a world-wide research team that is involved in the technology of the voting recognition.
Darina Political on their unbelieving gates:
Iveta - this ass you can keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtář (53) says - now it's Schluss!
After his wedding Joseph Richter (53) by Iveta Bartošová (45) became their lovers, Darina remained the hope that Joseph would expect and come home from rosarote dream.
But now it is finally over with patience, and for the rest of life she has made clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner," said Mr. Justiceriaová.
When Darina Richtářová of the song I. Bartošová had offered refuge in her own house, she wouldn't even be in the dream as it looks out with her husband.
When Iveta went on her throats after 30 days and returned to Ričany, Joseph went with him.
Yeah, it's even known that he loves her.
With the time, Darina resigned, and it seemed even like she wanted to recompense her unbelieving husband - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Richitary is not concerned with who his wife is sleeping
If Iveta Bartošova should leave in the future, then he will certainly receive no open arms at home.
"He's the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not go out."
"Nevertheless, not as a dear, deceived old axe, but as a man to whom I have yet some commitments," Mrs. Richtářová forgotten, but she also said that she had already been emotionally disturbed from him and was only on mutual responsibility.
The condition that Darina has cut him the door, Joseph is worthy to this time.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying together with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues to run, I'm looking for the repairs, the garden, the foundation, I'm doing the purchase."
"My Darina, I'm talking very normal, we're not going to share the bed," J. Richter (the sheet) Blesk said.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he doesn't want to prevent her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I'm sure that this is my fault, I've lost myself in Iveta and therefore I'll take any responsibility.
The worst women's injuries: How is it with you?
If you invite the men to call some typical female injuries, they shoot out of the army some of them unexpectedly.
Love women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines in which we let a few unseen revue again, which let the men take the blood into the rain?
Input Search
Will they have their gate to be incomparable?
Do you have to buy at least one hair every week?
Would you like to enter and can it be a little more in action?
Then, in your case, it's really a weakness.
Some women are at least conscious of that and are trying to keep their purchases in the middle of control.
But the hand of the heart, which woman already thinks it is to bow down on the search for a good-seeding clothes only by a clothing business and not at all (in all possible color combines) in the cabine?
Even if the acquisition for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hage.
Think of how often they said to her husband, you'll be better out of here...
Permanent Insatisfactory
"I'm not too dick?"
"I have to take at least five kilo -- should I start joking or making gymnastic?"
"Do I like you at all?"
Is that something happening to them?
Yeah?
Then you also belong to women who are regularly set out of how they look.
It doesn't mean that you should leave, but many men react allergicly if their wife continues to regret her appearance.
The stronger generation is agreed - with the increased frequency of complaints, women are always more inconvenient.
Order and cleanness at first
It's a fight against windmills.
Put windows, flee and smoke, shoot the wanne - and this at least twice in the week.
Shomp with her partner because he's again tramping with smuggling shields on the clean flights, shoot the kids because it's just shooting washbeck is already crazy again and because the glasshouse has a fingerprint again, where the polyer makes so much effort?
If you suffer under this kind of deviance, you should know that you cannot overcome anything and that the order and cleanness in the family life are not at first.
Finally, this unfortunate purity five can hurt mutual relations and, in particular, the rest of the family.
Buttons
"Smooth turnoses come into the wheel corb."
"Do you really want to take the old sockets tomorrow again?"
"A nose handhouse isn't just throwing on the bottom of the foot."
If your partner is exhausted in such a tirade, you can't wonder that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, it's not bad, but they just want everything he has.
If the men knew that, women might not have to meat so much.
Clean and tratch
Some women want to stuck and stuck, and there they will be cut off the back, or too deteriorated or dismissed the covenants.
Women are now focused on relations, so they like to throw the subjects such as, for example, who, who, who, who to whom, how and why.
Well, everyone of us has a little harmless clatch and tratsch on the camp.
The hand of the heart - that's the own of all women.
However, this is not to interfere with the most gross calibers, which are nothing and no one, which are most likely rejecting everyone in their environment and particularly for women collectives.
Jagr and Voraček help Philadelsa with their assistants to win
The Eishockey Sturm Jaromir Jagr had a large share in the moon game of NHL with two assistants at 5:3-seek of Philadel holding on the iron in Carolina and is the most productive of the Czech player in the NHL.
The user of the view of the ninety-year-year Eishockeystars was in both cases Giroux, who was called for an additional assistance and to the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also played Jagr's complaint Jakub Preáček.
Jagr claimed after the game Journalists, he prophesied Giroux a big night.
"Shoon before the game I tell him he's going to go a hattrick today."
That's what I felt."
"He and again gets such a feeling," Jagr explained, after his action Giroux has already reached a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second match also had "a Czech Track".
Preaček struck the puck behind the port of Hurricanes and presented it between the circles of the Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third headquarters, the home player Patrick Dwyer reached a shot hand, but the second third was the flyer again.
Concert Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr, he reached his meetings, then Wayne Simmonds linked his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player of Liga, but he certainly belongs to the best three," Jagr valued his center.
"My life wouldn't be aware that I was playing with such a eishockey player as with him."
"I'm very happy."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my fellow players put their game on me and now the spider turns around," shot Jagr.
Carolina still made a game to drama - through the match of Tuoma Ruutua and again Duer, who was executed from a criminal court, came to a gate.
But Matt Read prevented any other complication in which he was in overall two against one.
"Outge't acting Pronger still in our area."
"He threw the puck, I took up and (Read) went to remote stones."
"I'm trying to meet him and I'm glad that it's cracked," preaque wrote the last matches of the party from his view.
By this victory, Philadelia was set up at the top of the conference.
The Czech reverse player of Montreal Jaroslav Spaček hurt in the game against Buffalo and split in the second third part because of a damage on the top body.
The Candians, besides their experienced Beck, also have a lost carrier in Penalty shots 2:3.
One of the penalties could not change Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points pained the tragedy of the homemanagement of the high-related accident in the defensive - they played only with five players.
"It's bad."
"The meeting we played only with one experienced player at the end, which was young players."
"But there is nothing to do so that we must be done," Jacques Martin said.
"When we change an attack source after the other, we had nothing to resist."
"We had to make the game easier and get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves," said P. K. Subban, one of the players.
The Czech Tower Ondréj Pavelec turned thirty shoes from Tampa Bay and thus contributed to 5:2-seek over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five neighbourhoods, there were five different parts.
Development of travel prices since 1989
By 1989 there were only five authorised State travel offices in the CSSR: Chedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel offices were at the same time only traveling to the socialist east block countries, at the western time only chosen.
And thus the Czech tourists travel to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), into the Soviet Union (Sotschi on the Half-Sharp Crim on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary at the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, while they were to travel to Jugoslavia, then Jugoslavia took a promising course, and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were strongly restricted.
A big paradox of that socialist times was that no one had allowed the citizens of the East Blocks (as well as the Czechoslovakians) to travel free in the socialist countries.
For example, if a CSSR citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travelers were not possible.
When the travel offices also were assigned to travel in the west, but they had to take great snow in purchasing, or even sleeping in the travel office, or at least "good knowns" in the travel office.
Even so, the thing wasn't running for a long time.
The devisen award - the conditions for a way to the West - was only granted "politically reliable" people - those who were not able to travel.
The Czech Slovak Value was not freely exchangeable wallet, so without devising it would have been impossible to move the necessary funds (western wallet) for a travel in the west.
Thus, most of the Czechs delivered their vacation in the inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought a number of weekend houses and dadchens - a habit that is too awake.
The total revolution of 1989 followed a road revolution of the Czech.
Since 1989, a vacation in the DDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs delivered 4,5 million of their foreign flights in the countries of the world.
A big paradox that we do not know today is the fact that we could not travel to Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the daily Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of the 90s of the past century, the devise obligation was rejected in the neighborhood countries, which highlighted a poor well of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaks simply couldn't have enough time from their travels in the west, at least everyone wanted to be there for a few days.
Thus the Czech vacants slept at travels to Paris in the park, because who would have had the money at that time for a holiday or a pension.
A typical characteristic in foreign travels of Czech was at that time a conserve, beer and duration, etc., full-packed coffee space.
Another important milenstein was the introduction of the free exchangeable Czech Crown - after year, our tourists could finally buy the west wall.
Our lives and the average levels also increased, which moved 1997 to another important moment.
Thanks to the increased requests for traveling, the travel offices began regularly to prepare travel through charter flights after 1997, thus the flights were unbelievingly approved by the possibility of negotiating quantities, compared to the past.
The end of the 1990s, with the exception of the United States, had the Czechs already had a free payment traffic with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made it easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "Post-Samen" traveling was carried out in 2000, thanks to the high request of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since every year, direct charter aircrafts with Czech passengers in remote solar countries are running directly from Czechland 12 exotic destinations in this year.
To the 100 Tsd Czech every year travel to exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch, known to our "postrevolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States highlighted the obligation for the Czech tourists, thus our country was definitively involved in the high-developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs delivered for the first time more than the half of their vacation in the outerland (50.3%) and first in their history, including the costs in the vacation site, they exposed more than 15 tsd CZK per head.
The main assembly will find a new president - again a patt.
The Czech football has no president for about five months and has insisted that the follower of Ivan Hashek at the top of the Czech football band (FACHR) will not be even after the extraordinary main assembly on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is no agreement until today on which election is to be chosen.
And without this, it is not possible to vote over the three potential followers.
Three interested people want to manage the Czech football - Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás.
In June, Hashek returned from his function, where he invited his colleagues to find some and a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hashek, the old ability between the two band rooms that can't have a common candidate.
This appeared rock and clear on 16 September when the new president should be chosen.
The delegates of the main assembly were all the same in the Prague fourth assembly, because the negotiation did not result and it was not only the choice itself.
In fact, no one could be able to talk about who is voted in the assembly - only the rational representatives or also the functionaries equipped with a full power.
In this only point, at least partly agreed, which contributed to the Recommendation of the Institute for State and Rights, whose opinion, as a representation on the basis of full power, was not eligible.
However, the conflicts on the election regulation continue to continue.
In addition, the Implementing Committee did not more clarify the matter at its meetings - whether ordinary or extremely - in the principle there is nothing else in the agenda.
Even if the views about the choice changed several times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how should we follow in the third century to avoid a patt situation?
"The fighting point refers to the question whether to proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a whole other model should be found," Dushan Svoboda, one of the three representatives of the FACHR, who is in the management of the Profi Football.
According to the rational model, the candidate, which receives the largest pro-human support in the room for which he can candidate.
Morning is probably ready to enter the compromise that the candidate is seeing the number of votes from both rooms.
The Czech page again is the condition that the winner receives at least a two-third majority in this pro-utual voting statement.
"Therefore the two frontiers have no sense anymore, this mode would ask the whole two room concept," Svoboda understands the convictions of the seaside, which best thought not to prevent the election, but to choose a valid status.
It is surprised that Tomás is also like, even though it is determined that the rational choice order of all candidates is most likely to match Pelta.
"My desire is to be chosen mostly after the status."
"To not be issued our substitute officers, as at the last main assembly," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is first candidate and has been limited in its opinions, especially in Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
See View will be the new president in Nymburk, and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national community for the football-EM today would be safe to process the builders."
"If the football runs on the euphorian wall, then the preparation for cooperation is also greater," says the Jablonec functionary, which brings the greatest experiences from all three adepts, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl's back there.
"I hope to agree, but the situation is unfortunate."
"It's not a matter between the people of boham and sea, but there are some effort to make the rules for their own purposes to run."
"This is why a new blocking is not excluded at the main assembly."
"But I hope that the healthy human understanding finally sees," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to understand all pages remain no longer.
Some negotiations should normally be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete until the quality game.
The charter aircraft, including Dalibor Kuchera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, was not able to start in Prague on the morning because of a technical shopping, so you were looking for a substitute, as to bring a part of the Executive Boss to the location of the bargage handscape.
At the last time, the meeting at the Ministry level is decided to reach the middle-weight.
Joseph Dobeš, the Minister for School, Youth and Body Education, would like to move the parties in the largest sports link of the country to an agreement.
It is very much on the game: State applications, the confidentiality of the Czech football and also the current main assembly of the CSTV, which will show the new direction to the Czech Sport to the Sazka financial problems.
Like is the fight against the position of the President because he does not see appropriate candidates
If Tomás, the leader of the Pilsner Footballer before the extraordinary major assembly, could have made a strong candidate that would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new presidents of the Football Connection of the Czech Republic (FACHR), he would not have put it in place in the fight against this position.
"If there's a good advocate, I'd fight for him and deceive the choice."
"But in the present situation it wasn't possible to find such an adepte," said CTC.
The main reason for the illustration to go to Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl is, therefore, to prevent the fair favorite of the choice, Pelta, reached to the top of the FAČR.
It also states that, in the case of his victory, he remembers the function of the President only one year, so until 2013, until the date of the ordinary main assembly.
In the position of the President, he would like to see a top manager which is not too much in the football event.
"I have spoken personally with some people in question."
"Why to believe that some told me that they were not going to identify themselves with the Czech football.
"These views would like to have changed," he started.
In most cases, the connection of Pelta's with the President of the Pilsner's circuit football band, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial call, which applies behind the cows as a strong lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegated votes on main assemblies.
For example, it is not acceptable that Pelta had the position of the President.
"By Vig would be conserved today, and in the Czech football it was not going forward."
"The support by Berbr, a smart businessman, fighting the football doublely bad," stressed.
It also suggests that Pelta's name falls before some time in connection with telephone consultations to investigate in a corruption case, but the Pelta has been punished.
"I don't know what Prestige's winning of Pelta should be brought to the football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the EUFA and the FIFA," said a person who's former expression, "he'll overflow the pilsner's football club when Pelta's president," but he'll see something more allowed.
However, if we are able to win a balance in the Thursday election, we can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who was supported before the main assembly in October, ended with a Fiasko.
"He (Pelta) was the first one I'd go."
"He has great powers."
"I could, for example, imagine him as a leader of the national community."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the band as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters where I don't understand anything," said the victorious, which in September had given attention to the replacement of the Court Commission with Ludjik Macela at the top of the replacement of the Damková.
Itself claims that he feels the role of the chairman.
And based on his abilities in the management of pharmaceuticals, since last summer he is also a leader of pilses, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the Liga.
"I have the power to change something in football milk and to make a certain culture of this."
"To reduce the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and professional committees, which occurs to present situations," he suggested that no hair from his antipathie, for example, towards the Sparta Chief Daniel Kritinský.
As one of its priorities, he views the establishment of the relationships between the FACHR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he will lobby with the political policies to make more money from the lottery season to the sport.
"This is one of the decisions that the new president should take place."
"If it comes to control games, like the political parties, I understand their arguments, but they must also say stone and clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not look as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the FACHR president must be "transparency".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prager Dukla.
"This isn't just ideal."
"It doesn't also make my opinion much sense to overcome my actions in the Pilsner Club seems to a third person to restore after another half years," explained.
Pelta speaks of new statutes of the FAČR, which are able to resolve a patt situation.
Two days before the main assembly of the football assembly, one of the candidates for the chairman, namely Miroslav Pelta, will strengthen himself in the case of his choice that the FAČR will receive new statutes, which will be excluded in the future against the election order.
The functionary of Jablonec is confidential before Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the choice fight will be secured in a possible success of the Czech election.
Pelta had already spoken before the unrealistic election in September, he wanted to be able to be able to take place in his choice to the national society and to win funds.
He decided only at the last moment to share in the choice before the last main assembly and thus helped the two-month pause to defend his ideas about the leading of the football and to present in a larger context.
"Looking at all levels, the football is distracted, they are unpaid and therefore expected that the president is on Thursday."
"He feels that it's the maximum time that the link is led by someone, the man who is in particular associated with the Jablonecer Club, but who also acted many years in Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has enough experiences to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that for today's problems with the choice, the Euphorie is responsible for governing Ivan Hashek at times.
"Unfortunately, at the main assembly in June were approved statutes which were not as perfect as all adopted.
If they hadn't allowed different interpretations, we would have already gaha a president since September," said Pelta.
He just used the processing of the main document of the civil union as a lock fund for the delegates.
"If I would be president, then I'll take it personally and I'm ready to be a personal responsibility if it doesn't fail."
"This is a principle thing without which he can't be," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his contractors.
He had already announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindrich Rajchl, which he recognised because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opposite would be his first representative.
In addition to Tomás, he has no longer been attacked, and he has not left any drunk fade to Pelta again.
In the football he's moved over a year and can already be linked to a certain success."
"But his attacks were deteriorated and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"In addition, many are now doubting about real characters," addressed Pelta's contractors, who remain faithful to his proclaimers, which he has already expressed in September.
Se日 Consider his strongest weapon is the knowledge of the football of the underground game class until the national community.
And this should be the outcome of the Czech footballs.
"I would also strive to finish all matters - from the case Bohemians, to the neighbors of the corruption canal of the past year."
"And then, I would strike on negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funds for the whole football," said the six-six-year CATK candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleaning.
"I have to trust only once with the content of work of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where the long anarchie is significantly nervetic.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios, which are associated with the present main assembly, he believes that the delegates do not run to Nymburk on Thursday.
"If you really should be the only strict point, as you choose in the area, then we'll go away."
"The football takes faith and wins it only by having a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possible decision day of his functionary care.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts working hard under him
If the current president Jindrich Rajchl should be chosen at the main assembly on Thursday to the new president of the Football Connection of the Czech Republic on Thursday, this would likely avoid the launch of many people.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
→ He said to solve the case of Bohemians to improve the relationships with EUFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football and, otherwise, to continue the work started by the previous president Ivan Hashek.
"As President, I want to share the football as a whole."
Receive from international contacts to EUFA and FIFA, on the national election, the professional football, up to the service football for the youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the speech for CTK.
"I am a team player, so I want to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member is divided into a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football comes in each segment with miles steps."
Many wouldn't just be disappointed about this because they, instead of criticizing the work of others, should now really be hard to work," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, there has been no longer to candidate.
"From me, I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me, who don't cut me off a knife between the feet and ask any step I'm doing," he said as a clothe, why he was cut off.
"But many people told me that I couldn't leave because other people would do it."
"This is confidence that you can't play," he said.
It also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hashek.
"In two years, we have done a lot of work, and I don't want to just remove it."
"The processes have been started, which would come to be born only in a few years, and I would just want to see that she stops someone," he said, and thus brings his thoughts to express that for the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would have chosen, the situation could be back in the times before Hashek.
"I believe in systematic actions and this is something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Besides him, especially people who would make the football so that he would be there for the chosen."
I think you can forget something, but not that I'm partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then it's all right and not only the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
He also resists the opinion that he is only a president of the Czech.
"Although some people claim the opposite, I really want to do the best possible for youths."
"For example, it's time to consider whether you should not share the Liga in a Czech and sea part whose winners then ascend into the first line."
"Then it couldn't be able to do that today only three marine clubs in the Liga, which is especially a problem for young players in the sea," says Rajchl.
Because now also the leader of the Pilsner Club of Tomás has joined the battle for the function of the President, Rajchl does not want to appreciate his chances that he is chosen.
"I hope a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to her steward-president and now recognises that clear success is behind me," Rajchl also focused on the integration of ten million corners for unfruitable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he gives the debt of not to a single stream.
As he says of Pelta, "he's already disqualied to help the Czech football for a new confidence," he thinks the second rival - like a strong candidate who has really offered something to the football.
"Nobody can ask that he has done work in pilses in only one year."
"If he should be chosen, he would probably continue the things Ivan Hashek has started and also the personal holding in the Commission would not have changed fundamentally."
He would certainly not want to flee to his favors," Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Spring into Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planning in Ufo-optic, Prunkpools in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue miracles - and after a city tour or a wall ́s swimming feet in sprouts.
A book shows where Wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on the search travel in the past one half years, one did not fail in its package: his bathroom.
Returns on the water, she looked highly in artificially designed bubbles, met the wound marmor pounds that waited at the beach border, and stood over akribically restored youth style halls.
When she felt a bathroom, she took it up in her notebook - as well as valuable details about the building and story of the building.
More than 200 Swimbads announced architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents it in her exactly appeared book "Badefreuden": Popular whimshalls in München, historical bathroom palaces in Blackwald, "Hardcore-beton buildings" in the Tuunus.
By 13 countries, she led her "travel to the most exceptional bathrooms in Central Europe": Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czechland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and each city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year German is a real badeculture enthusiast.
With the sport, she has not much at the hut, says Meder - just in the water is different.
It is difficult only that swimfants must be found with blue bottles and chloride stones, while joggers can breathe the swimming dust of vineyards or enjoy a pleasant bird whistler in the park.
"I've asked me one day why the wheat must always be so furious," says the living meder in Vienna.
"So I began to gather beautiful babes."
Duplicate architecture of water surface area
Thus, the wellness factor in bodies is so large because all the senses are used, so meder.
And when the building efforts have been made, the swimming halls can be a real mouse: "The city of a footland you have a surface of water in bottles."
"He's on the other hand transparent, but he reflects the splendidness of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high popularity, bunched bottles, sprung bretters.
The small-formated "Badefreuden" band provides 190 pages of value over the history of the architecture and culture of wellness oases - but, especially, it makes pleasure on a sprung into the blue.
Noted copies discovered the Pool College Meder in their research in Hungary.
Besides the precious healthy bathrooms like the 100-year-old Shechenyi-Bad in Budapest, they found a nitrat-tower in a rocky carthole (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermalbad, whose beaches are stuck with alkaly sustainable water and are located in a flash-formed building (Városi Termalfürdö in Jaszberény).
Spe ́Culär looks forward to many frozen freedoms in Switzerland and Austria: Currently you have the whole city in the eye, you can look at the snow covered Arlberg in the outer pool of a bathroom in St. Anton - and: In the bathroom there is a window from which you can watch the drive on the ski-bar.
The most exceptional pool design expects bathroom guests in the Lungen field: The aquadome otztal looks like a Ufo just in the alpes.
From three open squares to top, it goes into the winter, while in the background the mountains of the ocean roast in heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in any swimbad, the Pool Sammlerin Meder of the chloric chlore grew into the nose.
Thermal baths ride to weapons, in the Arrd-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it is so strong to heiz oil that you have never believed to be landed in a health bathroom.
The wheel comes from the alkaly-hydrogen carbone healing water, which is almost black and its skin clothes one on the skin, as soon as you let yourself go into the beach - a wellness experience of the special kind.
On one place Iris Meder was also deceived on her search for beautiful bags: When she wanted to visit the free and sun bath in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a locked territory.
In 1902, Bad made by the Dušan Jurkovic architect was closed.
When Meder washed a cup through the spread windows of the red-white white-weather building, she saw an unknowledge between the flights.
The disaster has occurred in a swimming bathroom in the blackwald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three buildings have this bathroom already behind; not only Neoromanian elements from its creation in 1844, but also a Maurical Hall in Alhambra style, which was assigned to 1900.
Since the careful modernization 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite bath of the Pool-Kenrin Iris Meder - not only because it originately comes from the blackwald.
"It's already a power to switch so different bausiles to such a beautiful unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the tissue in the thermal pool is obviously only a neighborhood.
Agra-Speculation
Deutsche Bank allows rock business to light
From Christian Teevs
Does the German Bank open their business with farms?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Joseph Ackermann has ordered a working group to examine the consequences of the speculation for the poor world.
In January, the director wants to take consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, the thing is clear: 84 Pro · the Germans it seems that it is not acceptable to speculate banks with agricultural raw materials such as vegetables or meat.
Two thirds of the applicants are required that the German Bank and other credit institutions come out of this business because it has strengthened the problems of the poor ones in the world.
This is the result of a forsa request in the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
This is based on a report presented by the Foodwatch middle October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the laws at the global rubbers take the prices - and therefore the banks a conviction on the world's famine problem.
The Consumers' campaign is specifically addressed against the German-Bank Chief Joseph Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similar.
In the original case, rubber laws were intended to ensure the operators against price fractions.
However, in the meantime, most experts agree that the sockers have disconnected from boat and request - and to the costs of the poorest benefits.
Other than the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to check the precepts and said no business is "valuable to put the good call of the German Bank on the game".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, a International Working Group currently examines the provisions from the Foodwatch report.
To the end of the year the investigation will be completed, then the results will be presented to the representation of the German Bank, as well as the recommendation of this.
On the end of January, he wants to inform the bank's top, then, what consequences it takes.
At the end, a reduction of the rubber business could be made, or even the complete rubber.
Ackermann bastels and Images
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but also confirmed its criticism in the financial industry: "The law on increased food prices shows particularly drastic how unconscious banks damage the general welfare today."
Ackermann is now the main bank lobbyist, especially in the obligation.
"The German Bank needs to remove all installations from its portfolio where money for weapons is used for food prices," said Bode.
"It does not matter whether Mr. Ackermann is going to suffer hungry people or the call of the German Bank."
The Ackerman's insight is surprising on the first cup, but it is clear that the Concern Boss wants to give a perfect picture from the office.
On Monday, the German Bank said that the officer would not change in the Supervisory Board other than planned.
With a decline from the conflicted agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible inputs, he needed to do a little bit - so he would have done his followers.
Each second would cut rock plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the Manager.
Thursday, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Monday, the Board published the investigation for which the Institute Forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
It is therefore legitimate that the German Bank offers facilities for prices for food.
Banking customs would also take personal consequences if they realized that their banks were shared in such businesses: each second would report the investigation to all installations in which money would flow into the rubber inspection.
43 Pro ́ would take known persons from such a bank, give 49% to think about to announce their account and to change to another institution.
21th House in Vienna
The Environment Pavillon
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with heights, depths and Happy ends: the Austrian World Exhibition Pavillon of Brussel 1958, was in Vienna to Museum, standing empty and accommodated.
Now he's reopened as an exhibition house.
If the modern post-fold architecture is weakened, by clear forms, glass halls, silent sugars and new buildings that are typically for the faith in the technical progress, then the Austrian Pavillon of Architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussler World Exhibition 1958 is a famous and famous example.
Schwanzer's Pavillon then received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for his easily and weighting steel glass construction.
The building applies as a milenstein of modern architecture until today.
He made the architects so that he also builded in the next world of Austria Pavillon.
With the Legendary BMW Vierilinder House and the swimming neb building in München, he was glorified in 1973s.
As a temporary exhibition building, Pavillon had been designed in the Swiss Garden of Vienna in the Southway Hof and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20th house" was called it.
But the building was not space and technically as Museum - no walls to capture art, no climate.
However, it was so long enough until the modern genetic art in Vienna had a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the Pavillon, he now calls "21th house" and will be enjoyed in the future as a museum for modern art.
On service day, the Museum of Belveders, to whom the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happy case in every regard.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of Austrian Gallery Belvedere 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted Kuntoric with noticed Karee, etc., in the youth as a mastery, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a Constitutional Director of the Museum of the Modern Salzburg, put the construction closely at the construction of people and thoughts through the acquisition of public funds and private sponsorengels and set the use.
Outside the present art, the works of the imagehouer Fritz Wotruba should be issued from the same named establishment, a café and a bookload should be provided, and a Office house was to be built on it.
Strengthing view, small food
Crischanitz was then the ideal condition for the implementation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's session was sensitively converted and expanded and wined the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna, and the Pavillon was a "unreal important place" for him, where he had "fastly every week" viewed the exhibitions.
He knew the Ur-project, and he knew the problems of the building that already lost during his translation to Vienna and his reuse to greatness and easilyness.
At the current construction, there were much greater problems: the building was "a energy lock", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glassfasade have been changed, used in glassfaser isoler glass and replaced the glass with a special safety glass.
Coal-break stalks have been strengthened or replaced, and asbest given covered coveres have been sanished.
Two subcutaneous spaces for the new use, a separated light grave between the house and the street provides for the explanation, a bridge leads to entrance - almost a new building, but still the easily swanzer pavillon.
The original outsides are remaining, the house is stuck in the old rock-brown roast protection colorton.
And the Kinosaal is even exactly as he was before.
And all of this under the strict view of the thoughts and with a small food.
"Off had to be found a material that is good and proper and also to the mental protection office," says Crischanitz and points on a rubbish ground in the underground.
Despite all difficulties, problems and conversions, the building is flexible and easy.
Had it been difficult with the Pavillon, "the one came from Brussels", Crischanitz said recently a typical "Drop-in-the-City history".
Such a architecture is "always in the wrong place" and wants to "reveal a right conscience".
In this case, the 21th house is not in the wrong place, because there has occurred a town-building case: For the Swiss Garden is just the newly planned "Haut-bahn-hof quarter" with officers and residents.
And another happiness may still occur: The 21th house could get strengthening from another Crischanitz-Bau, because the College Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporary Kunsthale, and as you hear, it is already negotiated with the city for a neighborhood place in the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plant winter crises package in millions
The bathroom has developed a crises-plane to prevent access in the winter.
The number of workers to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related accidents and delays, the German Bahn provides a periodic report for more than 70 million euros in this year.
The "image" quotation reported before the vocation on a specific crisis plan until 2015, a total investment of approximately 300 million euros was provided.
This should also be achieved in extreme widespreads better available for vehicles and shine networks.
In addition, it is planned to double the internal and external workers for the elimination of snow on train facilities and roads at 16.000 persons.
The goal is to be freed from snow and iron until the start of the operation and 90% of the useful weights within four to five hours.
Two months ago, boss Rüdiger Grube had warned after a meeting with the government and the industry of access and late events in this winter.
In the past winter, the traveling in personal traffic had significant problems, as it also lacked with weak weather conditions in reservations.
Thus, many new regional moves have been expected for years to be authorised by the Iron Boundes of the Iron.
Moreover, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE moves.
The train also makes years ago that it has to allow asses of ICE moves to check clearly more frequently in the workplace after a ICE in the Kölner's main boathouse had an axis break.
German Bank pays million penalties in the United States
After the Tumult of Chief Joseph Ackermann comes a new accident from the United States: The German Bank has to break a million boats there.
As if the problems were not enough for the German Bank, the brenchenry is still in the United States' past: the Frankfurter Institute pays in a comparison of 145 million euros (106 million) to fight for the fight of five large genocence banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of hypotheking papers.
The financial regulatory NCUA proposes a whole range of large banks to have delivered the Gender Banks with false promises on the purchase of financial products; they would have undergone the risks.
Such papers have lost powerful value during the financial crisis and the banks are in depth.
"We are satisfied that we could resolve the subject without that the parties had to take the court," said a German-Bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not commit any debt in comparison.
This also applies to the citigroup committed to payment of 20,5 million.
The ECUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Propertyation (CUA) is responsible for the US Competitive Banks and is engaged in payments for the customer institutions.
The NCUA is trying to replace the occurred billion difficult damage.
The currently closed comparisons are the first of them.
The regulator had also been binding on other large banks, and in Summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The questionnaire hypothecical papers are also called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on household credits.
When the US Immobiliary Blue 2007 placed, this was a number of financial funds to detention.
In September 2008, at the level of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers killed.
Even if the events go back for a few years, the banks are currently in the United States.
Investors and supervisors have encouraged increasing complaints to obtain recovery or deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has issued the most claimable sources.
It proposes 18 international major banks that two State US Immobiliary financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have transferred in hypotechnic businesses in the volume of approximately 200 billion.
In addition, the German Bank has to make a complaint of the FHFA, here is a number of businesses in total of 14,2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisor requires that the Frankfurts be equal to "substantive losses" without, however, to be called a exact sum.
The German Bank had rejected the requests as uncontinued and explained that they wanted to return.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion in IBM
Financguru Buffett invests strongly into IBM firms.
Since March he has taken action in the value of more than billion.
Too long, the large investor Warren Buffett has always explained not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of companies is only bad to prognoze.
But now he has read the business reports of IBM and has changed his opinion of investments in the branch.
He has already had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
A investment of Warren Buffett is used as a rider in the financial world.
This is why the IBM IT urgestein can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett enth’s now in the US business sentence CNBC, he has bought IBM actions since march in value of 10,7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway is thus increased to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 Pro.
Buffett said that IBM didn't even know anything about the commitment.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had been provided for ordinary wins.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said to.
IBM has since regularly set up the lucrative IT series such as the operation of accounts.
More than 100 years old computer pioneers also offer software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had to avoid technology forms until the date.
He says he's only investing in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, buffett approaches at a frequency trail, with a milk manufacturer or machine builder.
His maintenance Berkshire HathawayProperty along about 80 own daughters also shares in a whole series of large concerns such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former monster back.
In the 1960s, the 81 - year - old Berkshire Hathaway had taken the small textile pharma and developed it with smart investments to one of the most valuable companies of the world.
Yet, his lifestyle is shameful.
That is why he is a cold figure for an innumerable investor in all the world.
His almost unnecessary sense for money service has introduced him the "Orakel of Omaha".
After announcement of the buffett investment, the IBM action was increasingly increased by a pro.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, is worth more than 220 billion billion in the border and counts with Apple and Microsoft to the most valuable technological companies of the world.
In Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to come in.
The reasoner Bill Gates is a great friend.
The threat is acceptable
Following the discovery of the "double cell" Turkey media in the German legal state doubts.
A newspaper speaks of a "blooding ideology", which is now again surviving.
The murder of eight Turkish and a Greek small undertaking in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-extermist background.
This message is responsible in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany and concern.
For many German turkeys, there is a longer dead penalty: since the brands in Mõn in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no comparable violence against Turkey with the right-extremist background.
However, the fact that in Germany there is foreign impatience was never in question.
However, the discovered right-extremist network shows the amounts of which the dimension is not longer dismissable.
"Let's blue ideology again?" titled the output of the Turkish magazine "Haberturk".
The magazine "Sabah" points out that one of the tissues would have been a V-man of the Constitutional Protection, and it is concerned that German authorities could also be developed in the right radical summer.
The Turkish community reacted to the victims of racial violence at the end of the week.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish men in a festival of the fifty-year stage of the German-Turkey advertising agreement.
In joyful colors, the one was inserted as a story of success.
The reporting of some Turkish media: "The German gift to the fifty-five" means the heading of a article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", referring to the murder bases.
In addition, the "Hürriyet" issue of Germany is not allowed to take this grateful connection.
"It's starting to stick," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people were killed, paying taxes and making a significant contribution to the rebuilding of Germany with their work.
In addition, critically, in Germany's Internet forests are discussed by the Police's procedure and their later experience.
Why the German authorities haven't already been able to look for in right-extermistic circles, the authors wonder.
Some of them are at least ready to drastic resources: "When the migrants continue to sleep here, the migrants remain nothing other than self-defense and weapons."
"This will be the best self-defense."
"On the goodness of the accusation and insensitiveness of the punishing of the whole network, the internal peace in Germany depends very strongly," says "Selen".
What it means, when the internal peace in Germany is inside, the attacks of Mõn and Solding in the nine years have been interpreted.
The photo of the brain of Solingen is deeply enhanced in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turkish living here clearer that there is a huge threat, and the Germans that disbelieving and distantness can be in right violence.
However, the attractions were increasing the weapon on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the past error
In the Turkish press, in particular, the consequences of Germany were included at the requests: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of MÃn.
Following the brand-off of Solingen, he sent a telegraph of advertising to the Turkish state presidents, he was representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Köln, but by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Claus Kinkel, once in his talk, how many taxes the Turkeys were held.
As a result, the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his tax.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows again how deep the depth of many Germany's disbelieving in today's legal state is.
Besides the efforts of an amazing inflammation and reevaluation of the right-extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it takes open words.
The Skandal Bank of Zürisee
The most adventure bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bankrotted in the financial crisis, and then the UBS switched from a crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge it.
That's what Axel Weber hadn't thought.
Following speecular decline from the bridge of the Bundesbank, in July it was stated that he would reach a nearly equivalent new job in 2013: the President of the Swiss Grande Bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative Care script.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, the Swiss praised her beautifulness and the UBS about her newly obtained solidarity and gave friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS created the Turnaround."
"I am happy to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grubbel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would be different.
A UBS operator in London had passed all the bank's security systems and washing around 1,7 billion euros.
UBS representative Boss Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the UBS's Administrative Council also applies as appeal - and everyone asks: When finally comes Axel Weber?
Weber was already able to consult the Bank of February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Administrative Council is already adopted in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank notified on Thursday.
For Axel Weber, it will be hard.
He is not a banker, much more economic professor and note banks and would certainly have needed an integration time.
He then takes the responsibility for a bank, which has soon shown again that it deserves the title "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because the UBS is a great part of one - to a short time before, she was the greatest power manager of the world - and, on the other hand, she slipped from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, it's the one that's so proud of the Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent call.
The image of the swimming and solid but also exhausted Swiss facilities manager had combined her with honourable goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
Thus, the UBS 2007, on one occasion, managed more than 1,6 billion customers than any other world bank.
And, on the other hand, she was assumed as investment bank in the Liga of the largest banks of the world.
That made it an impression.
The only banker and later long-year bank professional in Zürich Hans Geiger said, "I have always placed my students the UBS as a pattern of a good bank."
"How could I just be so wrong?"
He's hurtful.
In 2007, the first time it appeared that something belonged to the UBS.
In the midst of the year, the officer Peter Wuffli returned surprisingly, which was to be hot-in-lectical and genial bankers.
A few months later, they knew why he had gone.
The bank's investment party had been thrown with subprime papers and had to write billions.
To educate it, UBS announced an increase in capital in the amount of sage and wrote 13 billion francs.
For this reason, she found investors, however, which some of them would have been thrown up to the past: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and a Arab State Fund, which had not even experienced his name.
But that was just the first time.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The Bank had to give new billion losses, President of the Administrative Council Marcel Ospel, 2006, the Governing Board of Switzerland was returned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: the UBS stood in the light of its investment in the financial crisis before the breakdown and had to be saved by the State.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for thirty billion problems of value papers, which the Swiss egg scientist gave six billion francs for a demand change in which they could be the owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was shot - because she noticed how dramatic it was for a small country if it was so large banks.
The sum of UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the Swiss economic performance (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first catastrophe was the second.
For a few months, the UBS held it in the tax fight with America and declared ready to provide the data of potential customers who might have been behind with the bank.
In addition, she agreed to payment of 780 million - as a refund of unjustified wines from these businesses and penalty.
To help the UBS more or less open to interfere with tax interaction.
At the same time, she lost something that since its capital was in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of Diversity.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the repair of the Chairman and the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of customers.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost their credibility in both central business areas: in the investment banking through the failure speculate and in the capacity management through the support for tax interaction.
And just when it happened again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it again, then this incredible trademaker stories follow: a single handsheet deceives 1,7 billion euros before the Bank realizes that something is covering.
And it will be obvious: With the risk management in the investment banking it is not yet.
"In the case of Adoboli, you have to find that the risk control has been too changed," says Martin Janssen, economy and financial professor at the University of Zürich Bank Institute.
Furthermore, the proposal of a large German bank is safe: "The problem of UBS is that she does not have the risk control."
That was exactly the idea of the perspective with which the Swiss Bankers had been reached a long time ago to become guardians of the great powers of the world: no too large risks, for the security of money, too, the Alpen Republication could also join the world.
The Tresore of the Swiss banks became a symbol of unfair confidence such as Lindt and Sprüngli for special edle chocolate.
The central UBS in Zürich is still coincidenced with the closure of the dead Swiss bank - it is just a little larger.
Even the situation is classical.
The bank has its main seat at the Züricher Bahnhof Street, which leads from the headway from directly to the Zürich Sea, which is covered by the snow covered by the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are cool, the ladenimetes belong to the highest in Europe.
Youths like Tiffany are found here between Swiss Traditional businesses such as the Sprüngli Confizery.
Since centuries, the Swiss banks reside here: from the National Bank over the Palast of the Credit Suisse to elite banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS's receipt salon is located through a severe tour.
Drinns are the walls of marmor dressed, which are deep leaders, a great reference to "safe".
The UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
These ideas of the Swiss Bank have both Swiss Grand Banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, but sometimes they have disturbed or traveled as the leader of a small Swiss bank.
He does not want to read his name in the magazine, and he does, like all Swiss Bankers, too, businesses with the two major banks.
The UBS has become too large, especially in the investment banking, where the Angels are also expanded.
The Swiss wouldn't have anything to say anymore.
"And if, they have been adapted to the seats of the Angelsachs."
In fact, it was the English investment banking that changed the UBS saved you first high wins and then the debat: No financial institution has lost so much money as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was visible.
"In that middle-week, the government coalition of the small seven billion countries ended the greatest salvation action in the history of their nations," writes the author Luke Hässig in the book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion franks or about 45 billion euros have allowed the more to save the large bank before the bankrot.
How could that happen?
If you speak to Swiss bankers, they see the problem in particular in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined a strong concern.
There was a bank that was too large for the small Switzerland and continued to grow.
It helps to add the two different UBS-bases to the UBS: a rich but sleeping bank with the vital point of power management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalized.
Instead, the internationalized investment banks were favorable to many money with which they could turn a big road.
Two names are connected to this growth of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, the President of the Administrative Council.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-elected, wise, who understands many of models and statistics, and Ospel, the bowling man who has been up from the bank teacher to top."
But Ospel left the wuffli for the end.
And Wuffli, at the end, had probably made a decisionful error: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, the oversight came before the case.
UBS employees are clearly reminded of the meetings of driving forces, where the Concern Chief Wuffli still issued the same word: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The Bank was the most powerful investment bank of the Earth.
She introduced the "League Tables" that documented the success of the banks at that time.
There the UBS wanted to go up there.
Some steps have been successful for her.
In the devisen business and in the business of action, she played all over.
However, business advisers who were charged highlighted a weakness: in the international tax business, in the Banker 'Fixed Income', there is a strong distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has flakes in ananic hypothecs products.
In order to shut down these bullets, UBS went into an aventure that she almost costed the existence.
Hungary after growth, both the bank and one of its founded heavy funds invested in subprime facilities.
She developed to a strong machine, the value papers on ananic hypotechnical credits and continued, but it also maintained risks.
Moreover, other banks are seeking the outcome longer.
"And in Summer 2007, when the Immobilious Immobily Stayed in Flames, the UBS cooked there," says Bank Expert Geiger.
So big the Euphorie, so deep the case.
A manager had to go after the other than trying to clean up weaker than thought.
Posts at the UBS have been at the shopping seat and are wake up to this day.
Whoever drives the Grand Bank now has a nearly impossible job.
He needs to find a position for a bank which has been deployed by all nearby business models.
Bank researcher Geiger has already a idea: concluded with the investment banking, consolidation on the capacity management, back to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go so far.
But the investment banking is to strike strongly, so much is clear now.
On the next Thursday, the new bank head Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future.
The 51-year-old Italian Switzerland was considered as a transitional solution when the Bank was surprisingly separated from the translators.
In the middle of his implementation, he was to carry out the business of the UBS and shared the Zurich Bank on Thursday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to return to the middle of the ninety years.
3500 posts are stretching.
But it's not enough.
The UBS has a vision.
Who's she?
What does she want to deserve money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber's sure is now.
Publicly he only says that he will find a apartment in Zürich with his wife only once.
Next year.

Intelligent powers spread in cities
Seeds are used as "problem birds" places: However, from the towns the hot-intelligent animals are not longer exposed to experts.
They love one who wants to solve them quite quickly: Rain belongs to the city image since centuries, but in many communities, there are inhabitants' disappointments about the beast and the harvest of the animals.
This is not a means against the "Problem birds" until now.
Seeds were no longer getting out of the towns, experts said at the first seed symposium in the east-friesan empty.
There the experts from the whole territory of the Federal Affairs relate to possible outputs.
You are searching for alternatives in towns
Naturely, the problems in towns also brought back to the landfly of particularly seed seeds: the chemical impact in the agricultural sector is also devastating the traditional living rooms.
The jail, the construction and the case of typical brush trees made the birds life difficult.
Powers are under natural protection.
Great colonies with more than 600 brut couples are included in the westfelic south, in the northwest, including in Jever, diepholz and Achim at Bremen and in empty.
In 2005, a constraint project for massive killing of powers in the country area for negative lines.
Criticals have been subject to the catch of animals in birds falling and killing with novels as particularly brutal.
"The normal divorce, the loss, doesn't bring anything," said the town and landscape Werner Kluber from empty.
Nester strikes with water or falls in trees, has often unrequired consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Caiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals wake out, the big colonies spread up and divided themselves into other places."
Inflammation is only able to be excluded from hospitals, age homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we won't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding area, the problem is not solved in the citizens, the citizen Wolfgang Kellner mentioned empty.
It is likely to be a combination of animals from sensitive residence areas and lock offers to restore them to other places.
However, "Infotafels instead of ketten say", the psychological and ethnology Uta Maria Jürgen for a completely different relationship with the animals: "A pickel in the face we can s -- in the best self-conscience he's."
Jürgens in Schleswig-Holstein had joined the Ascheberger Krähen-Treeway to inform the notice of the life of the hot-intelligent seeds.
The project is already adopted by tourists.
In addition to the criticism of the birds, Jürgens had a own opinion: "There is every number of communications that have much to say."
The intellectual and intellectuality of the animals are legendary: Seeds use not only help to come to a lecker boss but also set their tools as a means of help.
Conduct researchers at the University of Cambria tested at least four seeds, how far the intellectuality of the birds is.
In a experiment, the birds learned quickly that they needed to bring a wheat with stones to insult to reach a motten larve.
Without a lot of training, they recognized objectively what size and shape a stone must have to carry out the platform.
In a second trial, the bullets had to solve a greater problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small egg with a motellarve.
With the snabel, the birds couldn't get their beasts.

Mass killing at a personal level
Insensitive and greatly Peter Englunds starts the new book "Skinness and Fear. A story of the First World War, spoken in nine sales" with a long list of major persons that go to heart.
Here is a tip of how you can do: Cut this page carefully and make it to your bookmarks.
They will know these people in English's romantic story very well. And these main persons will work as your GPS, as lighttorm at these few moments when you are lost like English men and women in the neck of the war and your illusions are beau.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new continuous secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel price for literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he did not describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are no messengers, racial reporters or discussions on taking and equipment.
It is less a book about what it did, he explains, but more "a book of how it was." It is "beliefs, impressions, experiences and votes".
"Skinness and fear" is nearly 20 more or less unexpected men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolmates and botanics to mountain growers, doctors, hospital cars and office officers.
Some of these people become herds.
Some are in prison, lost members, foolish or dead.
Each of these lives flourish like the votifs in a church, some come to, while deleting others.
The English book weighs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the emergency war at the Westfront.
"Skinness and terror" turns with expert view over other war screens: the alpes, the Balkans, the Eastfront, Mesopotamies, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, a festival of holidays among the piramides in Egypt, the tsets is an unresolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moved book.
The war overcomes the life of these people as a natural disastrous, such as a Hurrikan Katrina, who rides after cordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is with her children home, and canon fire hears in the remote. Do you stay or get the flight?
Who's coming?
Someone understands what is done or why this war is overwhelmed.
"Follow facts," says English, "becoming confusions, acceptances, hopes, angers, fixed ideas, theories of confusion, dreams, alptrums and destructions."
"Skinness and fear" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English hospital in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmatrose.
His stories were primarily received reminders, letters and other already published materials.
Your life reports may be terrible or increasing, but they are extremely alive in English of a small assembly in details.
They act of manage and seek help.
In the story of a German schoolmaster he said, "Substitute, everywhere."
"Substitute coffee, wrong alumie, wrong radiator rubber, paper bindings, wood buttons."
He told more about the substitution in Germany.
He describes "meat made out of pressed roads and was thrown into hammer fat (and recently served with a bad bone of wood), Tabak, made from drunked roots and drunked cartons, shoes that were covered with wood."
It was, as he noted, "837 registered Na ́s supplies which were allowed in the manufacture of wheels, 511 registered coffee supplies."
Some stories are acting of honesty and tactfulness.
A American recognises his own trial to wrath and says about the war: "You feel that, despite all things, it was better for men than to sit in the chair, with the evening sheet or the best haller and a whisky in hand, and that it means such fascinated civilization, and that there is no barbary behind your own strengthened and scheduled heatbrush."
Environmentally, a British soldier recognises that he is probably dead and that no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you take a distance from your minds, you want to think that this happens before a public," he writes.
Instead of this, it is so terrible as "a condemned man who has been binding in secrets."
Other observations are acting on the old Europe that falls out and on the new types of terror.
"The conflict has been able to make a economic fight," says England, "a war between the factors."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the still young century": "the word that is bound and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a measure, which kills while he sits behind a table."
Humans behave in unpredicted way and there are also freedomful behaviors like heroism.
Anglund determines the soldiers who are actively trying to cover themselves with a prostitute with a sex disease in order to avoid the front service.
"The great expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococky heat, because soldiers buy and smile themselves on their genitals, in the hope of coming into the hospital," he writes.
"They who were really distressed took him into the eyes, which caused them to be blind to their life."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, England's poesie is prevented, however inevitably and is perfectly suitable to his human task.
In decades of small scenes, he starts the way the war "in a single way uncontrolled powers: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders lead them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were more false like Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memo" or Romanes such as Erich Maria Remarques "In Western nothing news" than a huge story books.
Anglund's band participates in an unconventional roaming Hall.
His book has the greatest end of which I have ever been reading in a book.
I don't give it anymore.
But it's like he would have cut us with a book this page with the main persons from the nose and burned us with a tree tree.
After a early failure, a minutely planned transaction
Hundreds of police officers were shared with some of them.
It was decided for Monday night on Thursday because there are no people in Zucotti Park at this time.
The operation was secret and only a few high-range officers were informed. All others believed at first to share in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was in full challenges.
The events of the last weeks such as the use of Pfefferspray against protesters, which violates the rules of the decoration and makes the householders a huge growth of public sympathies, were not able to repeat.
And then the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Employers had prepared these by watching how conditions were handled in other cities.
A catastrophic exercise had been located with a shock on Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the Chaos School - measures to combat terrorism, as well as the rapid report of a large number of police officers - to be able to acquire on Lower Manhattan.
The last school unit was located on Monday night on the East River side of Manhattan.
The order to enter the park came "in the last minute," said someone who was trusted with the commanded, what he said for a declaration as "exercise".
"The few policemans who were joined in my chair didn't know that it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to stay anonymously.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-range officers of the resource."
A reason for mystery was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, the officers wanted to room the park, but then returned back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned from these plans.
Workers of various police units were assigned to the operation on Sunday, including use commands from the entire city - hundreds of mobile employees, which are usually used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people come into the park, almost like Pendler, so 1 hour in the night is a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people remained in the park," he said.
Saving cars with jupiter lamps and speakers were prepared before the pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bri.
The lamps and the messages that were recorded above, which dropped from the speakers, seemed to have many protesters.
When the public officers entered their blue windjack in the park, many protesters simply raffed their things together and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 a.m. wouldn't be stuck to give the protesters time to pack their hair and good together.
Other teams of officers have been seen how they gathered themselves in the environment to intervene should be needed in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the President of the Police, said that this happened to their own security.
But many journalists claimed that you wanted to stop them from watching the police in the park, and they said that the business of the employees was very quick.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in the Church Street were able to make photos on the western side of the Park.
When the police moved towards Westen through the large crossing of the protesters' personal things, including coffee, artstrass and clothes with clothes, followed their employees of the town cleaning that were left.
Some protesters who refused to go have been dragged out, and pictures of these have occurred shortly later on the Internet.
A main nuclear of protesters was in the nearby of the kitchen area of the stock in the centre of the park position.
Some builded barriers and the police continued their methodic arrests.
Circa 10 persons in the Epi area of the storage associated with their arms.
And two persons went up on the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Catastrophen protection officers were called to cut them out.
As Mr. Kelly said, there were no arrests in the park until approximately 3:30.
The space was completed after 75 minutes after the police statement.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority of the prisons came, as he said, because of "unfair commitment and opposition against a arrest".
The prominent officer was Joseph J. Es., head of the Department, the highest uniformized officer of the Department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the criminal officer, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "not the operation", as Mr Browne said.
In the case they should be accessed, a second group of employees waited for Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
On the Cortland Street, a north of the park, and on the Pine Street, a Block on the south, Barrikaden were created.
It could be observed how these places from the police continued to expand the surrounding around the Zuccotti Park.
At one place, many of them were observed by a number of employees, many of them with protection sheets, people were running outside.
Circa 28 people were in the north environment.
Some of the most violent acts of the night found place in the south of the Park.
On 5 hours a protester sprang south of the Pine Street to the deck of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the river of a police.
On one place, the multitude cast a piece of lockhouse.
At the end, an officer and a protester came to the hospital.
The work of the maintainer will be brought to charge against the city because of discharges
The company, the hundreds of school managers who have lost their job last month, plans to make the town a middle-week, because the exemptions are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools undertaken by poor students.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity that the company, the circuit Council 37, is still open in its efforts to refuse the releases.
Six hundred and twenty-six school assistants, maintenance coordinators and other employees who had lost their work on 7 October in a shockhouse, described the business leader as a political rate to refuse access to a health fund that the groups had undertaken, in the last year of the town, to be able to close the budget lucky.
This accusation was classically rejected by the authorities.
At a meeting of the City Council, Dennis Walcott, director of schools, said that the releases were part of the budget in June.
A member of the City Council came back and explained that in the budget there is nothing specialer that the workers would be released from school assistance.
Officers of the City Council 37 said that they had and warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint. In the middle of the week, there will be a press conference on which the complaint is formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will be made by Mr. Walcott and the Minister for Education of the City as a complaint and count eight deputed employees as claimers who are all colorful or latin American women, such as most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Ministerial of Justice of the city, said that the city does not stand before the complaint and thus cannot be commented on their individual charges.
According to a draft claim that the New York Times proposes, the company has conceived the number of schools in the arms of the city to submit a complaint for unbalanced treatment. She claims that poor schools had lost more helpers since they were underfinanced chronicly.
It states that while there were no releases on Staten Island and only a few releases in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 assistants were released in the districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight school students in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68% of the students lived in Armut, the claim states: "This is not a neighborhood of a closer parents who can organize S.A. to initiate budget shortages."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3,26 Pro ́ this year. The money was lost when the city changed its methods for additional financing for each inscription of armed schools.
The Community also complains that the leaders of the High School were led through the language in a memo, which authorised the release of the maintenance coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (Germany: conversion) in the United States usually describes the exchange of a teacher from a school list of contents in a pool of available workers paying by the central office.
"Six-six-six-six-seven-coordinators were released, not transferred," said the draft complaint.
Mission ended, Congress ready to understand about Libya
Finally, it seems like republicans and democrats in Washington were already to understand about the situations in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the rebels, the arrest and murder of the long-year dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the mixture.
On Thursday, the Committee for International Relations of the Senate concludes a resolution, which is submitted to President John Kerry (Masachussetts) with Senator John McCain (Ar©na) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), with Libya for the strict revolution and the American groups for their "muth".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libyens who have started rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is an operation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but until now, it was nothing simple in the Libyan discussion.
This summer, the legislators of both parties and the White House strive about the election of a series of resolutions on the forming or defilement of the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of the NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain proposed a resolution which authorised the restricted use of military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the senate by a wide range of both parties and there was no vote.
However, on the same day, this law passed through in the senate. The room assumed a decision to reduce the money for operations in Libya.
This means that the United States mission leads to a kind of legal feed - with a congress that has been made enough to criticize Obama's procedure in the framework of the mission, but not enough to finally remove the ground under his feet.
Then the unfortunateness of the congress was overcome by the events.
Tripolis fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Resolution of the International Relations Committee "congratulates the people of Libya for their great courage and their exceptional exhibitors in their self-submission" and "lo facies the men and women of the US military military and their coalition partners who undertaken military operations for the protection of people in Libya, for their exceptional courage and their professionality."
The resolution also confirms "the United States' national interests in a strict and unresolvable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support by the Board for Foreign Relations, or will the legislators deal with the law of June?
The last replacement is based on the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Spitzen-Republican of the Committee.
Lugar's speaker said that he had not yet seen the final replacement of the new law.
According to the Chapter, the senate is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment which requests a balanced budget, a high priority in nearly every conventional legality period of the Republics and some democracy.
The measures under the leading of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or of another area, which comes to the time of vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried to make their amendments to vote, although they have often asked enough.
Goodlatte change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress and included a whole band size of the subjects.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to the Congress and to the Senate - others simply turn away.
There are at least 15 versions of the change of compensation and another decade that would "control the expenditure of bonds".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their missionaries - especially the beginners of the Republicans who want to put up their lives - the possibility that they have taken such a measure.
The budgetary control law, which was adopted in August, requires that both Senate and Congress vote on a change in budget balance.
In March, 58 Senators voted for a non-resolution that supported the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that the members of the Congress can present, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to reject the limitation to two officials of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (I日nois) has proposed a number of amendments to guarantee the right to education and health care.
A change that offers a marriage under equality is the same as an amendment that underlines the burning of faunas is a continuing model.
Some legislators also want to enable the derogation of federal statutes if two thirds of the States reject them.
As the members proposed changes, they moved faster as in the past years.
In the 11th Congress, 77 of these amendments were proposed in 110. Congress 66.
The time is blurred, compared to the early 1990s, where Members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, as the numbers available to the Senate Library.
However, they were not much worse than those today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was adopted in 1992, but it was actually proposed to the Congress 1789.
"Founded, but not seen," Giffords in the first television interview after the attent
Ten months after a weaponsed man from the next distance during a choice event in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Ar
When she came with Diane Sawyer in the ABC message "20/20", she was stuck by words and needed help to go.
The sending showed the severe late repetition of the damage that the bowl, divided their shadow, made the left side of her brain and turned their head from forward to behind.
Three months ago she was surprisingly returning to the Congress to triumphing her voice to debt breaches.
In his first television interview after the attack in January, when six people were killed and 13 were lost, Gifford laughed, and sang - and described their geneticness as "swak".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41): "Ganz good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a "20/20" special, which was recently published before the new book of the marriage was published: "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The special follows Gifford's treatment since the attestation of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had opened in the first weeks, they are seen in the hospital bed, with a calcium rashed head and a long scale over the street.
She can only take one or two fingers if her husband's motivation for her.
Months later, Giffords are sitting in a roll chair, while therapies show her how they make simple moves.
A nick with the head.
A suck with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords claims another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's genezing: You can see how the Congress Laupers are sing together with the therapeutes of Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin'".
In interview with Sawyer, Giffords said that each day two hours with therapy that she couldn't be reminded on the day of the attendant.
Her husband said that on March 12, Giffords had preached an article of a day journal on the attentation when she had interrupted him and asked the six persons who were killed during the attack.
The mut-shore Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a prison in Missouri and is proudly treated medically while he is waiting for his negotiation.
"Many people have died," Gifford Sawyer said.
"Heart, heart, heart."
During the healing of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was met."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't injured?", said Kelly.
You're just found.
And you're going to go through this, and you're going to get up and you're going back stronger than ever before.
Trusts receive more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street-Gala that collected millions of Property for an obdeachless veteran in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a stone there, hundred soldiers, matroses, pilots and marines were gathered around him.
The multitude in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as herds," said David Saltzman, who organized the operation in the early year.
A high military officer in the Gala, which was observed by the head of the staff and then president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"You have been introduced as waisen children," wrote the officier in a mail.
I'm sure the organisers have made it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really not, it was compassion.
The crassed antiprogressive inputs illustrate the severe relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes wonderful publicity.
The troops are overcome with praise for their sacrifices.
But the lob has his price, they say the officers.
The public takes it as much as you eat people in uniform suffering.
"We were not anyway victims," said Brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, the people in Iraq will go to Afghanistan soon.
"But it seems to be the only way to support those to press us into the role of unlucky souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive for military leaders who want to appear ungrateful or in the fight against the public they serve.
They have also recognized that the wound that the returning troops had occurred in the last years of Vietnam war was much worse.
Consequently, talks about compassion in silence and between war veteran places are found.
After his two sons were returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would have seen them with a feeling of honesty because they were rebelled and traveled to exotic places.
Others would ask if a "wormful, violent veteran under the surface", said Cancian, who had fighted in Iraq and after his return, has taken a highly high state post in Washington.
In his work search, he said, he realized that some of the applicants asked subtilly whether he could be able to keep the pressure of a requesting post in Washington immediately after his back of the battle.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative inputs," Cancian said to his sons.
The weakness of the military is part of the vulnerable interest of the Americans in the war.
The forces in the field of battle are made by a country that has little experience with the military and only a few benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, just rarely exposed to lob.
"We, as a nation, do not appreciate military heritage anymore as it was absolutely usual in the Second World War," said General David Barno a.D., the United States groups in Afghanistan.
Instead of this, the praise of the more and the public is most important to the suffering of a staff member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have, the number of friends they have lost or the harm of their damage.
Military is the growing pressure for hard transparency in administration
In this week, an important consultation will be decided whether 28 women and men are accused of non-introduction in a military court of charge.
If not, hundreds of reclaimers are ready for the next consultation.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week she was pregnant when she was managed by a soldier colleague night.
It was in October 2008, and she just came back to her casters in Miramar north of San Diego from the evening with a friend when she met a man's colleague who took a 12th pack bier.
He asked her if he could be with them on a drink in her room.
"My alarm clothes went on," said Lyman.
But the Texasenin was disturbing her thoughts.
I thought, "What, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wanted to have heard my feeling of kidney."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lyman's room, the man came behind her, put her down and forced her, claimed her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and earlier military employees waited terriblely for a process with historical consultation in Arlington, Virginia, where a complaint which they have approved against the former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his precedents, Donald Rumsfeld, is decided in court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfield have not occurred against the largely broad administration within the military and under the damage of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a legal advocate from Washington, D.C., included the complaint at the beginning of 17 complaints that increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were managed or sexually misuseed by military colleagues, and that the military had dismissed it to judge, condemn or provide a suitable legal prosecution in accordance with the ambitional attacks.
Burke says she follows the main military leadership because the problem begins.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eliminate the culture's payment? The lead."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them may be part of future claims.
Their responsibility: Rather than all complainants put their eggs into a corb, they will, if necessary, introduce many other claims to get the pressure upright.
The Team of Defence for the Defence Minister, named by the Federal State Advocate Neil MacBride, has requested to reject the complaint.
The acts of the Court of Justice, which are present in Newsweek, are explicitly the defence strategy, in the first line that the military cannot be accused of current or former soldiers for the damage to which it has come into the fighting forces.
In the light of a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, which referred to as the Feres Doctrine, the Government does not take account of the damage that exists in the active service.
"The cruel damage occurred during the military service of the reclaimers," the document states.
The Defence Ministry refuses any comment on this story.
The things have changed since the 1950s.
If women have not yet been allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have only rare fronts.
As far as in Iraq and in Afghanistan, soldiers teams play very important roles, especially contacting inhabited women in the war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in fighting.
It's time to modernize the military, says Burke.
And she is not only there in her battle: three other claims besides her are attached.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic provides a complaint against the four main military academy for the mutual promotion of an unfair atmosphere.
Independently, the useful Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military in which the diagnosis "Personality Station" can be identified, receiving the administration sacrifices to leave them out of the service - a usual procedure of activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service of Women's Action Network, a group of human rights.
In December, their group reckons against the Veterans Propertyation (i.e. the administration of war Veterans) in which it provides its discriminatory practices in their negotiation with services for persons who indicated sexually misuse in the service.
Nine laws were submitted independently by a mixing of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offer a number of points of detention.
According to the 2010 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (t.e., Office for Prevention and Notification of sexual misuse) of the Defence Ministry 3.158 sexual misuse.
However, most misunderstandings are not reported, and after the Pentagon's own seizure, this number takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19.000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report published in the market also examines the criminal persecution rates: 2010, 20 per cent of the cases in the military court, only half as the civil law.
The complainants in Burke Case describe their attacks as the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the mutual administration of the military police less than one hour after the accident.
This night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her administration of a whole range of police, doctors and officers.
She had a mixture seat and the blood of her river, which came from a snare to arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was addressed by a judge. In the year of this consultation, she was asked after the sex she had before the offence with her friend.
Six persons said to be character products in the name of the mutual tatter, which was finally released.
"I still remember the day when the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the wheels would be used, and I cried out of the courtyard."
"You've put me in the psychiatric Division, and I'm reminded that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "I wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to request a military psychiater, who finally made a personality stage and explained it to be unemployable.
In January 2010, she was deceived unfairly so that she did not receive any support.
Whether the complaint that Lyman and the other complaints have submitted is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Justice at the George Washington’s Law School.
Yet, he notes, "By my opinion they should come."
What is between them and a sentence of judgment, this doctrine is criticized since it was questioned the first time.
I'm a criticist of the Feres Doctrine.
The military goes a year behind, because they do not make the same incentive and the same deterioration that brings a detention with it.
He said, "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when people are ready to fight.
If the audience doesn't follow its way, Burke, the legal advocate of the accusers, will start with its hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became a new view of legal extremism in Europe, others Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who had been able to walk in a cycle in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, was his first public audience before the court.
While Breivik may have handled alone, he is not alone in Cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time to appeal to the computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who underline the right-extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this sommer, researchers wanted to find more about these people.
But how can you find her?
It's easy - you just have to log in in Facebook.
"We have found that it wasn't difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main report of a recent report of the British idea factor DEMOS on the digital population in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopædia, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as they do for years.
Bartlett's team found a half million fans right-extreme groups in all Europe and then showed them with ads, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the adds users invited to a question in which they were asked according to their educational status, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 100,000 attachers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 countries - without only one time they had to leave their office.
"It's a very new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not surprised. Online leaders are most young, men and are threatened over immigration.
But in a kind of surprising decline, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more intelligent, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new warm tool in the hands of professionals.
Ideal factors, medical scientists and scientists use the page to study everything, from health issues to society trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three contents per day, Facebooks "Datasupernova" generate a research tree that allowed the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title in the last five years to increase about 800%.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is the fact that you can study people that usually do not reach with Clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have granted them access," Bartlett said.
"In Facebook all of this goes away - you're going directly to them."
Others say that the page offers a possibility to recognize and solve social health problems.
A current range of Dr. Megan Moreno from the face of Wisconsin, Madison, and their colleagues found that students who discussed their full-scale on Facebook are significantly stronger than students who are aware of this subject.
Moreno suggests that simultaneous students, such as resident advisers, monitor the page and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you didn't recognize it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko- Author and leader of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify children who wouldn't have been found otherwise."
Facebook also continues to organize his own population data.
The data team of the page has created statistics on the relationship status and the Valentine Day, election shared in the between elections 2010 and a national happiness index (which was used in the first line only in Facebook access - the master of digital freedom knows that the page should make its large databases available for others to research.)
But Facebook users know that the page observes whether they want it now or not. To make a friend who is remote with the thousands of miles to play Scrabble, you allow the page to produce your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a question of which they don't even know anything?
Current researchers have strictly defined guidelines, how they collect their data offline, all are allowed online.
"I don't believe that many users have overlooked the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," said Neil Selwyn, a sociology at London Knowledge Lab, to a loop from 2006, where he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"What she was about, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there's still the question of the methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
So, despite its years, Selwyn thinks as technology researchers that a Clipboard and a staff are still the best research tools that can be used.
"There is no replacement to go out into the real world and talk to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of social care - and every amount of social life is still offline."
"Cald and unhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears first before a public court
Otherwise, Behring Breivik, the man who has stood two amokcrees, in which 77 people were killed in Norway in this summer, himself has been described in the first appearance of a public court in Oslo as a "opposition" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Norwegian Temple Ritter," he said before a courtyard with more than 500 people.
"I'm appealing to the court because you've received your mandate from organizations, undergoing hazardous sideologies and because it's supported by the multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't recognize myself."
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monology, since he was not wanted to give the opportunity to use this audience as a platform on which he could express his views.
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who made a predicted talk, to return to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also recommended that the Police Breivik for 12 more weeks in investigation, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will control the entire correspondence within eight weeks.
Within 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the consultation.
Some were in hope to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the operation to stay behind the lock and riegel.
All took part with the goal that everything would go out to a closure.
"I thought he worked cold and unhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian sender of NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me there's a piece forward after I saw and heard the contemporary."
Breivik took a dark tower and a blue crawl and worked hard and professionally during the whole hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he dropped and left the building again.
Despite the bizarre indication of Breiviks, he would be part of a larger "opposition" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not spiritally sick and said that there was no evidence that he had been a complex.
Some may feel that the attacks from 22 July appeared to be the work of a individual extremist, not the group of radicals.
But does it automatically easily easier the cover and the confusion that still looks at a whole nation?
"I want him to look like a monster, but he doesn't," said the member of a victim.
"It would be so easier if he eats it."
7 Lections of the interview with the dead Steve Jobs shown this week in a theater
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compare him to Henry Ford and highlight the technology as a large modern finder.
But what Apple-Fans may find in the most recently discovered job interview, which has been exposed to the important markets in this week, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workshops in this week.
He was probably a designer, a dreamer and himself called hyppie, but he was also an akribical organiser who was appealing to graphs - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered to "a illness of thinking", "that a really great idea of the work... [but] there is a great amount of handwork art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Fachidiotes" on the exit of the personal computer. And he sat longer than one hour with jobs in which they were conducting one of the rare, explicit talks.
At that time, the jobs were spent 10 years since the Apple was dripped. And he had already severely on ­ new computer companies NeXT and enjoyed the wide acceptance of the Internet.
Since a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fachidiotes, he said that the copying proposals of the interview were missing in the delivery.
First after Job's death, a full VHS copy was found in the garage of the director.
This easily over-film material is the foundation for the 68 minutes film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview", which comes to the landmark theater in the middle and Thursday.
For someone who is for the purpose of accepting exhaustive interviews, Jobs here appear surprisingly quiet in the presentation of his philosophy and business strategy.
And incrediblely thinking.
During the interview, there are four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly distorted his thoughts and efforts to accurately strive.
There are also moments in which Jobs' perfectionism comes to day when he seems to be unlimited to Cringelys questions and urges him to get faster on the subjects or neighborhoods of greater importance.
Before the time of Pixar, iPod or iPhone is recorded, the lost interview appears insecurely when jobs evaluate what other companies make their opinion right or wrong and represent its own vision of the computer's future.
It's a thing to read posthume appreciations of Kare Jobs'. But Jobs here as the desired dreams that are on the sprang to majesty is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision how things should be and should be.
Soon after he had done all this here, he went away and did it.
A quicker cut on seven notable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to lead a company:
"When the whole year in the business I always ask, "Why do you things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, it will be easy."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in business really thinks about things.
That's what I found.
Jobs continue his efforts to analyze the booking management in Apple.
Bloods, how the costs were exposed - most of them were started with "Standard Propertys", which were affected only on confusion and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed a automated factory that ensured that the business costs were able to be determined to the smallest.
How the paper was healed:
Jobs told about the "Blue Box", he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could enter into the phone company and telephone talks.
The device has already been written much, but Job's fun, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-confirmation, is hiding.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a taxable phone, playing a call and then connecting from a AT&T network to another, while they translate as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things a half decade around the globus and when we were throwing into the phone, there came a minute later on the phone back," Jobs said kicking.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something that can control billions of infrastructure throughout the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think it would be an Apple without them.
Jobs told further about a glorious streak, the Wozniak and he almost left when they called in the middle of the night through Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the dad, while so well they could imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchie were invited in the middle of the night to talk to the Ananias diplomates, both had to laugh before the father himself came to the phone.
How he loved the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett call):
At the age of 12 years, when he was looking for replacements to build a frequency numberer, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone, jobs received a share-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a significant influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in the age and it formed my views of what a company was and how well it treated his employees."
Later, one of the HP workers visited the research lab of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer, which was ever made".
He was as big as a coffee, had a small screen with Braunscher Ríe, and I loved him.
At HP as teenager, I'd be hanging up and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve Innova:
Sometimes in the interview, Jobs are talking about how to find new products spontaneously.
Soon in his car, when he built some plates, he was asked by a customer to join the entire computer.
He had a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about the construction as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple he reminds himself of the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I'm reminding of prosecutive arguments... you claimed me that it would last five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could leave for $15. That was unbelievable.
About large enterprises that leave:
Long before he released Apple again, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial gigantes were running with their visions in stolpers and lost control over their actions.
"Did we say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copy or printer, after and?"
You're holding the actor monopol, so the company's no longer.
Sells and marketing make it more efficient, so [in the case of such people] who finally lead the enterprises and the product with which people are taken from decision-making.
The genius of the product that has led to this monopolation is required by people who have no concept regarding products or bad products - handwork art.
What was done in Xerox...
Xerox could have done all the computer industry.
You could have been bigger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could be...
You've removed the delay from the victory.
About innovation as an artistic form:
"It's a lot of handwork art between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and w."
You learn much about his beauty.
You must take votes, certain things you can't, but electronics, glass, robots, factors.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and they all together...
Finally, it's going out of the shame, it's also that you're trying to set up with the best witness that people have created and then try to gather these things to what you do.
Picasso said to copy artists, to clothe great artists.
We're always shameless in the steel of great ideas.
The part of what Macintosh did great was that the people who work there were musicians, whistlers, artists, zoologists, historicals, which were the best computer scientists of the world.
If it wasn't the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with enemies of health law, as a Court of Justice
On the day when the Supreme Court assembled doors closed behind, to examine the political shared question of whether to be addressed a campaign of the health law by President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and −rence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was listed by the office to represent the case before the court.
The event was found in the past Thursday, when all nine judges met a meeting to consult the petitions to test.
One of the cases to be treated was a complaint which 26 states have raised against the extensive reform of the health existence, which has been committed by the Congress last year, a law which has been made for the conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed with the consultation. In fact, in March, a 5 1/2-hour basic division is expected, which probably will encourage the presidential camp 2012, which will be completely at the time when the judgment is given.
The lawyer, who is standing before the court, will probably be Paul Clement, a general lawyer under the Government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PitéC, was one of the nearly two decades of companies supporting the annual dinner of the Federal Society, an ancient group that is dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another enterprise that sponsors the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Inde Business, which violate the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmacist Pfizer Inc., which was financially shared in the result of the process.
The dinner found a few hours after the court had consulted the case, placed in a Washingtoner hotel.
The service had, among other things, Mitch McCon日, the Chief of the Republicans in the Senate and an explained enemy of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit the events of the Federal Society since years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are delivered from the Code of Behavior, which regulates the actions of the lower covenant judges.
If they were, they would have fallen under the principle 4c of the Code, which said: "A judge may share in the Acts of Benefit, nearly and other organizations, whereas the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor or a program of such events."
In contrast, the extreme closer to Scalia and Thomas were due to two of the case-related offices and to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alarm moral and governing activists.
"This blooming brush with moral and the opposite to the code strains the claims of certain judges lies, the Court holds the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil right movement in the United States.
"The judges gained and dinnered during a bone event with legal advocates with the court's injury procedures."
Their occurrence and support of a Supplement Action for this event understood any request for unpartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little attention to critics who say that they would be too easily mixed with groups leading from the agenda, such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a conservative activist.
However, the conservatives claim that there is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general State advocate under the Obama Government, when the first law in the first instance came before the court.
Their critics forced Kagan to turn away from hearing the case because of pre-adoptation, because it was too much involved in the defense of the law to be unconceived.
Kagan doesn't make an officer to do this.
Boeing takes 18 billion record jobs in the country
Emirate aircraft orders 50 two-way flights from type Boeing 777 with a option on 20 other flights.
Boeing six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business in value of more than 1 billion.
It's really a rare message that a company gets a job over 50 parts of its products.
But it is a big business when the Boeing Co Airlines Company is and the list price for these 50 aircrafts is at a record sum of 18 billion.
It is also unusual that Boeing's officer is: the Middle East, a growing goldmine future aircraft orders.
In a prognose published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that aircraft companies from the Middle East are required in the coming 20 years of 2.520 aircraft in the value of 450 billion.
Boeing announced the weekend his greatest assignment for commercial aircraft all times, in the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer mission came from the airport Emirates from Dubai.
The flight company also, as Boeing announced on the Dubai airport 2011, has an option for buying 20 other flights that allow the whole list price to increase to 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air commanded six Boeing 787-8, the so-called dreamliner, which enhanced the gas consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircrafts is more than 1 billion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," Neal Dihora said, a bossman of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Flight companies of the Middle East are in possession of Oil producing countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the flights. Moreover, a increase in the oil price that normally damages the flight companies, because this is one of its largest cost points, not so damage as the country deserves a low oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other aircraft companies to break or move aircraft orders when the oil prices grow, Dihora said.
"You have a natural insurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeings Führer position on the market for large space aircraft and helps to keep the airbus competitor SAS in shak, which takes account of the A350.
Boeings Sieg on the airport comes four months after the airbus announced, you would move the introduction of the largest A350, which directly competites with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was dismissed to gain more confidence after the customers had requested a useful load and richness.
Boeing actions increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President seems to lose choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the enemy handler Fausto Vallejo has supported the PRI in the round around the government repositories.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost its request for the office of the Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. They claimed on Monday, the hands of the enemies had influenced the running for one of their enemies.
According to the provisional results, Fausto Vallejo won the institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, the running around the government resorts in the Western State.
"The intervention of the organized crime during the whole election process and especially on the terrible day is alarmant, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the choice on Sunday.
"You threatened our candidates, our employees in the survey... you have occupied election cabines, built road blocks ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven years in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are trying to go back and win in Michoacan is a major step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only been a little shot that had led to the issues before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido Action National PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Left Democratic Revolution Partie PRD, who is currently still official government, came to place Three, a severe delay for the split and unfortunate left lead for the presidential election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the temporary results.
Vallejo, an ancient citizen of the capital of Morelia, lies to negotiators and forces the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan was a long time controlled by cards that have been specialized on Marihuana, Heroin and Amphetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to start a military offensive in December 2006.
Violence still endures.
A PAN citizen was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates were out of the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, unless the choices in Michoacan appear.
The man who is probably representing the PRI in the round about the president's office is Enrique Pena Nieto, the Vallejo from Washington, and said, "I think this winning will let us look courageously in the next year."
ADB calls Asia for aid in the salvation of the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to submit the salvation of the Eurozone in its serious debt crisis to prevent a long-term deterioration that will reduce the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director of the ADB with Sitz in Manila, said that both of the most fast growing economics of the world must do "all things in your power" in order to clear the recovery of the wall block or through the International Value Fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), which was "freely" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the leaders and the resources through Asia would help prevent a long-term breakdown of the global economy.
"We're all sitting in the same ship."
"So is every helper who can help Europe from this crisis," he said the Financial Times in an interview at the border of the world economic for in Mumbai.
"Asia may be cut up to a certain degree, but it's not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all the means."
In the past months, the European electoral Union is in a serious debt crisis.
In the past days, Italian price costs increased annually, and the Prime Ministers returned from Italy and Greece.
The coming serious debt crisis in Europe makes anxiety that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls, the leading countries should be together to submit the euro zone.
Mr Nag said that every support of Asia is channeled by the IWF, but said that mutual agreements, such as the purchase of Bonds of the EU salvation Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiations to the partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "when everything is going to do in his power" to help the Eurozone, since the own economy is now suffering from the exported exports and the extraction of foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the euro zone to remain instabil and turbulent," he said.
"We are faced with great challenges and we need to receive a high level of growth."
"It's no option, it's a job, for where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argument that developing economies such as India are not allowed to help the rich Europeans if they themselves stand against great economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor of the United States Brown, said that it would be politically hard to overcome the 1,2 billion people in India to help Europe, of whom more than 800 million of two or less than a day.
"Everyway, they will find out that the Greeks are going with 50 rounds and bring vacations on the beach, and then there's a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic For, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to maintain the numbered and well paid employees in the public service, with workplaces in bad ways, lossing institutions such as the railway.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis in the Eurozone will have "significant dominion effects" in all Asia.
The ADB's prognoses with a economic growth of 7,5% in Asia for the years 2011/Now "the risk of disturbance" due to the suspicious Europe.
He said that hurtful wheel marks should be made "Christ plans" to spend themselves for a devastation and a significant capital immigration of their vocabulary.
Driving warnings from the pentagon before possible incidences in defence
The Defence Minister Leon Panetta invited the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget shortages would be unnoticed to the national security, and that he solved a financial reaction from the Pentagon Halls to the wars of Afghanistan and the citizens.
The Pentagon already thinks about shorts of 450 billion in the next decade, but now fears that more shortcomings of 600 billion or more will be needed if the Congress cannot achieve a conclusion in the issues.
"The effects of these shortcomings would be honest to the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Ar日na, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a consensus of the congress in the aim of a budget agreement, which will lead to such a decree, would lead to 23% of general shortcomings and a stop of many new projects.
"That's a high shortage, conducted in such an insignificant way, the majority of our ships and building projects would be unemployable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously damage," Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We would also have been forced to separate us from a majority of our civil staff and, since the reduction would be so quickly implemented, we should allow civilians to achieve the goal with security of a limited probability."
"These changes would be the faith of those who retain our military upright and seriously harm our alarm preparation."
The shortcomings were finally met with the fighting groups," Panetta said.
"When the war-time quantities in the anti-terrological battle are not directly affected by the arrest, the serious input in the basic budget would affect the efforts of war," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and the setting supervision under the war."
"The staff's holders would be reduced, which leads to later payments to war-shoppers and the legal and political support would be led."
The two Senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic shortcomings on the Defence Minister.
"The consequences of the arrest of the Defence Minister would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power of the world."
"We are very contrary to this draconic action," the Senators said in a common clothes on Monday afternoon when they published the Panettas letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and it's certainly nothing that we should have to do."
"The prejudice is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their income should not be placed."
Whether Panettas Letter and the new warnings of Senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will enhance requests to exit the pentagon of shortages.
Panetta has almost disblooked the possible shortcomings, although he could collect many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and he knows that he stands against serious decisions.
At a press conference in the last week, the Defence Minister made a dark picture, which could be preferred - a military with shale, but without nuclear.
"It's a ship without matrose."
"It's a brigade without munition."
"It's a air weapons chat without sufficiently educated pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, a army of the caesers, buildings and bombs without sufficiently educational soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his instructions in Pentagon.
"It's a fighting power that misses moral and alarm preparation and is not able to take it with potential enemies."
"They let a real whisper be."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta reported new details how reductions "significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious limits of our worldwide impairment and integrity, which lead to an inacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects of the victim could fall to the victim, those who have already been tested and are already in the former planning phase.
This list also belongs to the fight of F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomb aircraft, the next generation of Ballistical U-boots, the new Litral Combat Ship and the new ground-flying vehicle needs the army and marine to replace the humve.
If you stop the further development and tests of F35, this would be compatible in the next 10 years to 80 billion, but the billions say that it is an important step to arrange so that possible powers can be called by China and other enemies.
How to discover a lie
A corner on the current lines shows how significant and far-breaved disappointment and lies are in the daily life.
The presidential agenda of the Republican Herman Cain is employed to become the accusations of sexual disappointment from several women, and both sides refer to the lying one another.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of the Myeeds because reports have been reported that a pensioned football tra trace has been sexually misuse.
In the last week, the French President Nikolas Sarkozy, of the President of Barack Obama, said that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
lying lowly carrying and threatening countries.
The New York Congress Deputy and Internet Exhibition Anthony Weidner became a fool when he rejected disbeliefs in the surrounding area, which were very quickly reflected by unusual evidence.
The former presidential agenda John Edwards is accused of the offence in the financing of the campaign, which is related to the deterioration of an extraordinary business.
And then, of course, no one who has learned that the median circus, president Bill Clinton, was lying during his second official period in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shoes in school and college tests are broad.
There were events in which the teachers have provided their students the responses to the tests so that they themselves do well in their performance checks.
Mentors that should teach the opposite are sending a message that lies and shoes are okay.
How much do we experience?
As they say, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
However, these lies are deceived.
Another area shows that the strangers lie each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Liars to recognize or "detect lies" is one that is important to learn for every human, and this is both for personal and famous reasons.
Without a company game such as sharaden, where it is the goal to call you!, it is a serious area that is based on scientific data that has been collected in the past six years of viewed universities, which conducted large research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physology.
A result of research is that most old myths have been discovered about lies.
Liars look at one in the eyes.
They're stopping, stealing, rejoicing, and not always covering.
However, we cannot conclude that these lies are hard to discover and discover.
A practiced lying agent can go through the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, which is fine face expressions, about questioning and timeing.
I have given several years to investigate the scientific results of the comprehensive and continuously growing area of discovery, and it is clear that discovery is a modern ability to learn easily and helps us to find in our complex world, especially if the establishment or question of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to their own responsibilities.
Good liars are very well in appreciating others to wake their interest and control their own emotions, and they look intuitively as they are taken by others.
Thanks to research, the extroverted people are more often liars than introverted people that men are more often "the same oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually, they want to smite the feelings of others - that married people are less often lying to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they say are mostly "fearing lies").
We also know that if a person was deceived as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of being enjured to this person.
How do you recognize if someone's stuck?
First by watching the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baselining", the output position.
It provides a reference point to the later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laugh, the voice quality of their person.
You should better know whoever usually triggers with the foot, so they don't accuse him wrong when he triggers him during a meeting with the foot.
Then take care of the addicts of adequate verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Consider these attachments as a warning gloves that strike, not as a evidence of discouragement.
People who throw, may surprise when they try to remind their story. Maybe their feet show the way to the door or they refuse to go out, change their position in significant way or show a "restauration after the setting talk", this deep, disappointing spirit and the change in the attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questioners often fairly signal that a setting talk is forward only to keep after this repair after the setting talk.
Take care of the language of your testing person.
The expert of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the form of the past, when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and solved a national search for her.
Young people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeated a gentle question.
The most common verbal signs are subtil.
Some people use "qualitiesing language", when they answer a curious question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I have ... after best and consciousness."
This means that the answer will be more comprehensive than possible, which often strikes the alarm bullets.
There is no tuberculosis to discontinue lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which a discovery is possible.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can be rarely offered to the victims of distress, both in professional and in professional life.
Conflicted plan of oil pipeline is made by a long-term US authorisation
A few days after the Obama Government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline of Canada in Mexico Golf, which enhanced the workshops and at the same time enhanced the environmental level, it has tried to re-plan the project so that you can restore to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be transferred from the environmentally sensitive area of Sandhills to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision on a press conference in the building of Nebraska.
Alex Perbax of TransCanada said that the company continues to be convinced that the Pipeline is finally approved, even though with another history.
This has come after an announcement of the foreign minister in the last week, after making a decision about a federal assessment for the project, until the new possible history is checked that the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala accommodation, a large subwater service, is a major.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental examination, appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, may take a decision until 2013, after the elections in the next year, even if the employee lies that they were more involved in the decision.
Obama explained the last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the External Ministry and said its support.
The 1700 miles pipeline was connected to the Golf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 Barrel oil per day from the province of Alberta to the raffiners in Texas.
This should be the pipeline of six states.
They hate the environment, but they love workmarks, because they appreciate the pipeline 200,000 workplaces.
However, the legislators of Nebraskas, who are against the plan, decline the laws to force a decline from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala accommodation, a main source of drinking water and weighting.
The current aspect of the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had only little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy indicates that the Ministry's main examinator has requested a separate form of the review procedure, which could be addressed to two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist who was established by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was advised by Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether an undertaking who has been assigned to perform the originating areas was an incompatible choice because it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of being a little kid who has been forced to break
A New Yorker family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the Lobby of her Manhattan building would have received a tob-search attack that would have made her little daughter so much in the way she had been transferred.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" song made the 18 months old Genevieve Monk so that she suffered from "Personality changes, slaughter" and "increasing before strangers", her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was the past 10 November, when the big worker Kevin Monk, his wife Rosen, a child garden, and Genevieve wanted to stop a family flight.
The money Kevin Monk took the car, Rosen Monk went with the packaging and genevieve on the arm to the lobby in its building at Riverside Boulevard.
Rosen Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Nobody shoot behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter just does?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on the arm," she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman wou.
"You said in an aggressive sound, "You should not leave your daughter near the door," said Rosen Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care about what you say or think."
She was wounded and started shaping - she used the F-word and the A-word and was very sound...
She had a flash of water in her hand and began to cut water out of the flash on me.
She said Genevieve would have become historical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle was cut off on the mother who still had genevieves on the arm, and had to keep away from her direction and be held to a waiting car, said Rosions Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to be delivered, she said.
LaBelle's family was written to ask for a excuse, but it was not answered.
LaBelles' legal lawyer and representatives did not respond to calls in which a opinion was requested.
The complaint is on a non-determined damage rate, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he doesn't take account of the honorary and the family plans, the money that she gets, the child cancer help will be used.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take the responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if a child's garden is placed on the day that a 18-month old baby is on the arm."
Climate distortions broke the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is at the government, the unemployment and black work increased in Sinaloa while the foreign investment returned and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, the Sinaloas is in memory. It is the first year when Mario López Valdez, who is the initiator of the change, and has a great hope about the economic growth of the government. However, according to climate oppressions, the growth can not be the talk, but the main economic indicators have been deceived.
The low temperatures in February have not only caused losses in millions of landscape, but also reduced the growth of the state economy and caused a general reduction in economic activity in the first fourth year by 3,6% This is mainly to the historical reduction of agricultural development by 31,16%, which has affected further economic sectors.
According to a report issued by the Council of Mexicano para el Desrollo Rural Sustentable (th. Mexico's Council for Sustenance Agricultural Development) on the impacts of the Frost, 582 000 hectares were protected by agriculture used, of which 78.03 Perfect and the remaining 21.07 percent were partly decreased.
The reduction of economic activity until November has continued to increase the unemployment in the Mexican State. The Instituto Nacional de Estadistic y Geography observed a rapid increase in worklessness in the first fourth year, since from January to March 55 053 people of Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4,53 Pro · the job population. In the second quarter, the rate of worklessness increased to 5,28 per rate and from July to September 6,19, which has 74 000 workless in Sinaloa. These are 18 969 people more than in the first fourth year.
Lower liquidity
The worklessness in Sinaloa in the year returns to several experts. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the University of Economic and Social Scientifics of Autónoma (UAS), comments that the public institutions express indirectly the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently watching is an increase in labour unemployment that has to do with several persons, among other things with liquidity losses on the market, due to the reductions of funds by the legislation which has been prohibited to control the monetary weights in the Congress, because for those who are prohibited, it is not easy to allow them to work for themselves to invest or to use them for anything else," he said.
Migration broken
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also resides in a demographic officials.
"The number of persons who leave the country in search for work in the foreign country, especially in the United States, has gone back, which is to return to the income problems and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work in it. These people remain here and look for work here, which allows the unemployment to grow," he says.
Black Work
The analysis of the work in Sinaloa is still more important if you take into account the higher part of the black work, which includes in accordance with INEGI 60.38 Pro ́s employees in the country who work without paying to the social insurance costs.
For unemployment and black work, the lower loans, the lower in Mexico, in accordance with the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (mexican social insurance measure) and the Secretariat del Trabajo y Prevision Social (government of work and social provisions in Mexico).
The average monthly income of the employee in Sinaloa was until September 5352 Pesos, which is much less than the average of the national average of 75 pesos.
Reduction of the ADI
In addition to the decrease of economic activity and growing unemployment, the highest reduction of the external direct investment (ADI) in 2011 will be decreased in the last years. The Secretaria de Economy (Stational Economy Participants) reported the ADI from January to June 630 597, which corresponds to a wound of 87.74 Pro· in comparison with the 5 143 312· in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretariat de Development Economic del Government (Government for Economic Development) provides a total investment of 17 280 000 persons in 2011, which comes before all businesses from the tertiary sector.
The obligations
In view of the economic crisis, the Government of the country requested a credit of 3 000 000 000 persons in July, which should be invested in the 18 common infrastructure projects.
Reactions
For the representatives of the undertaking, Mario López made evident that the first Government year was incapacity of Valdé's government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the Camera Nacional de la Industria de la Transformation (the State room of the processing industry in Mexico) stated that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize views of different sectors, the Government of the country.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very powerful this year; it must be hard to recover the lost territory this year and we have to do a double effort in 2012. The efforts of all, in particular, the progress of the already agreed government teams have not been sufficiently agreed to each other."
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events, such as the Frost at the beginning of the year, intensified and delayed the economic development of the country.
"The small economic flow is the result of several events, including the Frost. One of the most important effects, is a disturbing economies that are not sufficient to move to produce a economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services, so we will end the year alongside our expectations," he said.
Redefine Practice
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation Patronal de la Republic of Mexico, explained in Sinaloa that the State should be initiated to dynamize productive activities.
"In general, we have noticed that it was done, and we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to re-evaluate the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There's much to do.
The President of Coparmex pointed out how important it is to develop a future perspective that links the efforts of the Government in better trains.
"In general, I would say that the Government has achieved results in various areas, and the economic development has occurred, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He noted that the current State power has made progress in the Government.
"There are areas that can be said that the government has handled more comprehensively; what I can say is that the government has been able to say and that the government is conscious that there is a lot of work before her," he said.
Prison for 8 kg Marihuana
In five years of prison and 100 days, a resident of Navolato was condemned because of the possession of eight Kilo Marihuana.
The State advocate of the Republic gave, the small-handler is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a penalty against the public health - here the owner of the Marihuana to trade.
According to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexico military soldiers in the monitoring of the road of Cipriano Valdez against the westpost no. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The little-in-laughter entered a white delivery car in which he found a black cup in a box in the car and on the driving seat a small rock sack in which the military found eight kilo and 23 grams of Marihuana.
That is why the accused product was transferred to the judge of the district and the penalty continues to be in the full trip.
Debt for building work
The social buildings for migrants are running in the programmes of Habitat, Rescate de Spacios Públicas and 3x1 to not be completed because of vital resources or only with great delay, Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Government of the State Authority for Social Development explained that, despite the development programmes have already been progressed, they are now weak because the government has not paid its existing funds that exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was nearly 50 million peso, from which 25% were fallen into the state. To this end, only the Federation and the community would have contributed to the building works, so it would have been expected to wait for a long term of building.
"12 million have to stick to them, and although the year is over, they have not given us any penny, and that, although they had already had to shut us some part in July," he said. "To not be late, we have already started with the building works, and they have already progressed far, but we need the money."
He highlighted that under the Government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with its obligations, therefore the community had to take a credit of 7 million at the beginning of its government.
"This has already been our way in the latest legislation, because the State does not have sufficient economic funds, and the programmes continued, and in this year we have had to get the funds that the State had not introduced to participate in these programmes."
Even if the State authorities are committed to payment of these funds, he recommended that the Minister for Administration and Finance was requested to reduce the administrative work and to pay the extent as soon as possible.
"But 12 million have to take them, and although the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transformation of analogues to digital signals is the most important changes in the world in the last years.
The Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) reported the constitutional institutions submitted by the Senate and the Advocate House against the Presidency Class and the power to provide the exchange of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to eight votes required for the legal enforcement.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, was the opinion that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his responsibility when he issued the legal decree with details on the exchange of the digital television.
This Decision rejected the Constitutional fight called by the Senate because he did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality, so that the law remains in force.
In the draft complaint issued by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the legal decree for constitutional consideration, since for the regulations relating to radio and television, the Commission Federal de Telecomunications (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) would be responsible for the legal decree.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero was the same.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Deputy Chamber of Constitution were invoked against the Decree of Law. After the adoption of the claims, Minister Sánchez Cordero did not invite the legal decree again and imposed all activities to establish the digital transfer.
The Ministerial Board also refused the complaint submitted by the Deputy Chamber without taking into account the debate on the project for which also the Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In contribution, the President expressed not to agree with the arguments of the project, although the Government of the countries is not able to regulate the measures to be taken by general rules.
"I don't also believe that if you would do this, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also noticed that for the planning of strategic areas, such as the telecommunication sector, the central government is responsible for fundamental reasons, because it leads to government matters.
The replacement of the analogue signals by digitals is one of the most important changes found in the last years of the world, and it makes a better use of the radioelectric spectrum, a higher quality of the signal and more channels.
The advertising of the transformation, she thought to be an extension of the use of digitalization, which is a decision in public interest, which has not only technical viewpoints, which include economic, social, political and technical aspects.
These matters, she noted, "the work of the whole system could be necessary, in accordance with the principle of the economic governance by the State, included a group of characteristics that put the Constitution into the hands of the Central Government."
She recalled that many countries had already implemented the digital transformation worldwide, although they had overcome the Government, even though they were over highly specialized institutions.
It is not possible to conclude that the Government, with the exemption of the advocated law decree, will enter into the competences of the Congress, because the laws imposed by the legislation would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility to calculate the voting sign in Michoacán is added individually.
According to PREP’s information, the sublime between the first and the second place is at the election of the Governor by approximately 27 Pro, which has not yet been calculated by 879 votes of total 6074.
The possibility of a single calculation of the vote box is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, since, according to the data issued by the programa de Results Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place between the Governing Boards is at least 27 Pro · and 879 voices of total 6074 are not yet calculated.
In this regard, the President of the Council General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Angleles Llanderal Zaragoza, noted that the electoral authority just once last 9 November had adopted a series of rules for harmonization of local rules with the reforms of the States of the State in elections.
It is noted that Michoacán did not enter into force his political constitution, nor his election law, nor his election law, on the election of the reforms imposed by the Congress, so that they did not enter into force in this election. The Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication within the time of the terms provided for by the Congress with the argument, or with a conviction against it.
On 9 November, the Master Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional claim submitted by the local legislation and assessed the vote of the State official to the Constitutional reforms as "invalid and legal", as he does not have the right to "determine or introduce a veto against it".
María de los Llanderal, in an interview, explained the possibility of a single statement of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Council General del IEM, the possibility is that the local electoral members can share or complete the voting records.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more election packages may not be partly complied with the results of the protocols; the voting and voting reporting protocol is not relevant or it is not in the possession of the Chairperson of the Electoral Court or there are evidence errors or changes in the registers.
The total calculation of the elections completely issued may be made if there is a difference between the mutual winner and the one on the second place which is equal or less than a proe, before the start of the meeting, a express request of the Partie. Coalition president, which is the second of those candidates.
The voting statement can also be made in its total, if after the end of the ordinary appointment, the distinction between the mutual winner and the candidate is at the second place equal or less than a proquet, it is expected to be a express request by a representative of the party whose candidate has been secondly made. In this case, the election packages which have been issued in a part of the calculation would be excluded.
It is important that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the subsection between the first and the second place is nearly 0.16 Pro日, although the votes of 129 of the total 923 election protocols have not yet been calculated.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the place Saltilo very young to enter the school of the air weapons of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't think it was because they thought that it would even hurt him on a ship. However, he always tried to do his dream to become Pilot.
His nephe Jorge Alberto Dàvila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He was almost coming to Saltilo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Martha Saha to Saltilo."
The young man recalls that even in the age of seven years, he was led to Zapopán to graduate his family family, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he was best: flying a flight.
A last recurrence
The principal leader of the Mexican Airwaffe, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was dismissed under the leadership of the Governor Jorge Torres López with all honors. His honour granted him the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the mexican air weapons, school leaders and students of Saltilo education, where he studied in 1985 as well as in the sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the public secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were distorted.

Middle-year education of the new Italian Government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present this new government that the crisis that Italy has led to the economic cohesion breaks will offer the bridge.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present this new government that the crisis that Italy has led to the economic cohesion breaks will offer the bridge.
A communication from the Presidency Palace announced that Monti named on Sunday would take place with the State President Giorgio Napolitano on midweek to visit the Government education.
It will be concluded that it will represent a majority of technocrates, although it is still not clear when the new Minister will attend his office.
Monti said that he would present to the President the results of the discussion with the political parties on Government education.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to be completed with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner said to the journalists.
Monti did not expressly practice the government training, but his comments show that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well hidden," he adds.
Monti has made it in less than three days to form a government, which is much less than normal.
The new, former EU Commissioner Monti's Government must adopt a hard spar package requested by the European Policies to win the inquired trust in Italy.
The pressure for the oil on Monti was still strengthened by the pregnancy marketing station, due to the charge of the Italian state liabilities for 10 years, which corresponds to the position in which Greece and Ireland had been forced to acquire the safeguard.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Industrial Verband Confindustrie, shared the press after a meeting with Monti with, "We said we would submit this government according to all powers."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this situation.
The successful chances of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to return to the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are determined to bring results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Mediterranean Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, because many of its members have yet spoken against a majority of the Technocratic Government, which just forms Monti.
Support by Parliament
The new Government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unemployed spending measures.
The opposite to its efforts or the subsequence of reforms may result in a rearranging attack on the financial markets.
The Italian band of foreign banks is running with reference to that Montis is a disaster, also pressure.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, businesses and undertaking associations, as well as young and female organizations.
The session shall be completed on the day of service.
Monti was called this Sunday by Napolitano, who has made an extremely fast government change as a response to the crisis.
Following a short breach at the end of the last week, when Berlusconi would return, the uncertainty of the success of the new President has reached critical limits on the costs of the Italian state liabilities.
It would be too much for the current EU salvation of Italy with a state debt of 1,8 billion euros.
Monti said that his Government must take up until the next elections that will probably be kept in 2013, despite the predict that the people will only give him time to implement reforms, instead of predicting the elections.
Monti stated that he would like to take more in his cabinet, but the large parties believe that this should be only from technicians, a reference to their thoughts to the procedure established by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that the mutual mistakes and unity between parties are complicated with the involvement of people from the political life.
Spanish have more games than the Ticos

The experiences with the Spanish Furie in complicated games in Eurocup and the Football World Masterships are added.
The Tico footballers have a few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is very lower in the FIFA range list.

Casillas will play against the three colored community today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.

The Quintet took place Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his twenty-year existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that makes it."
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give the next Sunday in the National Station of a best concert.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that a dream was made for them when they were playing in Costa Rica.
This assured the bassist and members of the group, Jeff Ament, the Viva last week of Brazil from a exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20-year existence and on Sunday 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they ascend from 19.30 in the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an exhibition from the statement that is to find the full copy in the online output of La Nation.
For your cazarican fans, a dream comes when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Do you know what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also works for us.
This is just the second time we are playing in South and Central America, and it has been great until now.
I was just once in Costa Rica. It's a beautiful country that we're gonna stay there for a few days.
For us, it's exciting to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely produced, and they experience the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most amazing fans?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We had almost 21 years until we arrived to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and I'm sorry to have been needed until we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the greatest show of the year.
Doesn't that be a little pressure from your bowl?
Some of the greatest shows that we have placed in the last 21 years found place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few riesshows in Sao Paulo and hoped that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we've got a pleasure to play there.
We love this country, we like to survive and we are amazed by Dschungel, so Costa Rica belongs to the best countries of the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and his walls to surfe?
Our friends are surfer and I have a great friend who is in Tamarindo leων, where the walls are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been driven to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico are the excellent area to surf. In this way, about people who love surf, we have learned that.
You have offered riesenhows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we don't have any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a multilateral repository.
You never repeat your repository.
Why?
I think that is part of this because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 li. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we will play each other is not easy.
If we take two or three songs we haven't already played in the repository, we can get our conquest better upright and surprise us because they call us the reasons in memory why these songs have enjoyed us. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and I think, therefore, for the public.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you look back, is it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
Once again, I believe that no one of us has imagined to play in a great rockband, and that is more than 20 years, which is like a dream.
We also continue to put on these blessings and find it nice to do music even now.
We love and we are amazed to produce music.
We're lucky to go to the places of the world we've always wanted to visit.
The things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the birth hour of the greenhouse?
It was always a honour to belong to this group of large bands.
We are well friends with people of Sound Garden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising and very unusual when a move from a group of friends comes out.
A band comes out of a city, but it is already unusual when five or → groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and we feel honest to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
In the last year, we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney, and we saw Sound Gardens on their tour. We are glad that we were still friends with them all, and it is pleasant to be part of this upcoming Seattle sounds.
It is also very unusual that a band like your musicians has stayed so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together since 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. This is only much more time than many bands to overcome.
Once again, I believe that we all appreciate the happiness of being still in life and also care for each other.
We all are a close friend, why we have opened musical ways that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music.
Your relationship with honour was not always easy. On the other hand, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you think a balance?
The way we are grown has made us easier to find an equality.
We make sure not too often to be on tournee, because it is too easy to stop this game with great human masss that love your music.
As long as you think that people have come because of the music, it reminds you that you have to take care of the music and what she has called in life without being a famous rock star on it. That has never been interested in us.
What reminders do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we have written very much songs and at first it was great.
We had been a band for three years that had never issued a plate until Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
We were deceived about how long we used. We are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I think what was for an incredible man Andy and how he laughed me. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football and many other subjects.
He was an extraordinary person, and we miss him.
The inland band Las Robertas is responsible for the exhaustion of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore you have asked the band for the exhaustion?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band is best for us. Therefore, we are interesting in seeing what Las Robertas can offer live. This will certainly be urgent.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter always when you play alive?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He's sing to him, and I think he's singing the first thing he can.
Of whom have you been influenced as Bassist?
From so many+
The first to me belong to Geezer Butler, John Detwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many that I could talk about the bassists I like.
How has Pearl Jam succeeded to keep the greenhouse in life, although it is no longer a manifestation?
I don't think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I've previously invented, for example Mudhoney, Sound Garden, Nirvana and all the other who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great, because it is rewarding to hear this music and bands like Mudhoney make now better music than ever before.
First, her music was dark, now she's positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are some songs on the new album that could make something easier. But there are also other Li Others such as The End or Just Breathe, which are recorded as very dark songs, even though they have something positive on themselves.
The dreams came to me when I heard how Ed was playing, and they were very dark songs.
I think if you are older and some traumatic in your life - for example, if you lose a family or a friend - it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly.
But I also believe that you can be a happy man, even though you can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for your studies
The former president Alberto Fujimori was delivered to a public hospital in order to investigate the loss of his legs, his household informed his household.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is deceived by 25-year prison for the violation of human rights during its government period (1990-2000), has several diseases, ≥ language cancer, which is operated four times and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congress member and his personal argue, told the television that Fujimori would examine three days in the Peruanian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to identify the reason for his pain and loss of muscles in the underground body members.
Aguinaga commented that his view of Fujimori could be granted for humanitarian reasons, however, he did not want this because he was unfair.
He was operated four times in tongue cancers and he lost 18 kilo weight. Additional diseases like a serious erosive gastritis, a cyst in the bowling wheel, renal stones, blood pressure, and transfusion problems in the feet, the Ar.
Fujimori has been located in the Haftanstalt Direction National of Special Operations de la Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for murder of 25 persons by the deadquadron of the Peruan Army, who was secretly occupied during his government time.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
A official agreement, referred to by the Uruguay President José Mujica, which is available by several ministers and undertakers, starts on Sunday their Mexico and expands the trade between two countries and discusses the political issues of the region.
Mujica is meeting with mexican colleagues Felipe Calderón in the next middle of the next week. This will be the information of the Uruguay president of his exposed term plan with chairmans, business officers and a meeting with the colleative of the Uruguayer living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "seems to exchange information on all areas between the two countries," the Chairman of the South America's country was on his website.
According to local media, Mujica searched for the support of Calderón in relation to the intermediate case with France when the French Governing Boss Nicolas Sarkozy at G20's gipfel meeting in the French city Cannes set the South America country on a list of tax paradises.
In the discurso, Sarkozy made it possible to exclude the countries that still occur as tax paradies from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and requested by the Messengers in the country.
Since November, Mexico has the G20 presidency, a group of the most powerful countries of the world. Since January this year, there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double investment with the South America country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has attempted to facilitate the confidence of agreements on exchange of tax information in order to be guided from the "great list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been made at employment level since 2004, which has contributed to a growing goods between the two countries.
The snurry installer consists of the size of "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting for the salvation of the princess Peach from the clouds of the wicked bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that this month comes to the theories of all the world has been assigned from the beginning to the properties of the tractable console Ninthing 3DS, which can be played threedimensionally without a special brilliant.
"Mario is the figure that must say how the stereoscope works without brille," Omar Alvarez assured, the responsibility for the specialized presses in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed from the beginning of this console", since until now there were success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adjustments already existing title.
The speaker of Nintendo highlighted that, although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "fortunate" video game that allows a quick, flexible game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to start the less shocked users.
Afterward, experts can turn a "two-three" to the various game levels that will always be weaker.
▪ users can actually choose between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the barriers, without the "optical effects" victims, it must always be played three-dimensionally.
This flight of Super Marios in the three-dimensional world also means the back of the figure to a trailable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo wins the fans of the Saga and repeats the successful reception of the last issues: The accelerator installer needs to overcome with spitched platforms to free the princess Peach.
However, the player puts news on the movements, the environment, the clothes and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Column provides for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Alvaro Colom, announced this Sunday that he would place the delivery of the former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the denunciation of the money weight of $70 million.
In this case, the procedure on the request of the United States for the delivery of Portillo will end so that this may be presented before the court.
In a press conference, Colom was held on the basis of his decision based on the independence of Justice and Government, taking into account that a decisive court had already arranged the delivery.
He noted that during his Government he did not mislead himself in court decisions and placed all the requests of delivery which he had been informed.
Outside the Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious body damage, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Esdra Paredes, both due to trade.
The action of Coloms is a Government act that is made when all judicial and constitutional institutions have been issued to condemn the former president of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Court of Justice and the Constitutional Court of Justice of Guatemala, Portugal must be delivered if its law is claimed in Guatemale and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the submission of 120 million Quetzales in the Defence Ministry during his Government’s time, and this negotiation was made for the delivery, but the Minister imposed the opposition and rejected the case.
Trinyove has helped 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion
The organization was called to avoid the marginalisation of young people without professional training.
The first 25 years of the Social Aid Organization Triniave have led to important results: In this four hundred, 6000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the basis of the year, in a event in the former workshops of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 persons were participated, Bi日.
Trinijove was called in 1986 in the city quarter of Trinidad Vella with the goal of life to help young people with small education, without work, with problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the festival of Sant Andreu, many responsible institutions and institutions who have joined together in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at election times was the unpartiality of the work held by Triniovo.
Besides the President of the Generality (Parlament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and Family Presidents Jordani Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former socialist educational minister Ernest Maragall and the former citizen master and currently left-ground city rat Ricard Goma.
The large village of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalogue Minister for Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of Sparkasse La Ca, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he noted that Trinieve was called to life in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated, but he adds that the work done to now is "a basis".
For the Presidents of the Generality, Trinieve is an example that can lead to difficult circumstances, and there is hope for people in difficulties.
"The economic crisis is for the union and the work he provides, nothing new," he explained.
Employed house in which the rice party was made was released
The householders had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelone).
The 12 householders left the building yesterday afternoon without opposition.
All indicates that the alptroms of the neighbors of the house No. 51 have ended on the Balmes Street.
Twelve people volunteerly left the building that they had illegally occupied and organized large festivals that had driven the neighborhood to disturb.
After the space, the door was completely changed to avoid a similar situation.
"From now, access will be controlled," said the householder.
The householders who had 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - who were residents - took the whole electrical installation and part of the water supply.
In the three underground stages, large partys were held up to two days, and the midsts were running to dismiss.
Besides the building, there is a diskothek, a Balmes 51, which also carries shades.
Her inhaber, Maria Pantinat, explained Europe Press that her business would return to 80% from the beginning of the household.
The owner of the discoteque pointed out that the householders made their competition unlawful because they put the drinks up to three euros while they costed 10 euros in the diskote.
The owner of the free-time location was shown by the neighbors for the rest of the village, while their statement does not draw up by the clusters of the disc, but by the householders, and in particular by the guests of the festivals organized there, and those who have been more and more in the last weeks, according to the disappointment of the injured neighbors.
The responsibility of the Discothek explained that the disappointment was so big that she agreed with the owner of the building, not to have to leave a middle for the last nine months.
In addition, the Guardia Urbana (state police) also confirmed that she had received more challenges from the neighbors in the last weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - Popular - Partie) in the City Council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week to release the building immediately and to get the problems of the civil society and the coming of the city quarter in the grip.
He explained that before summer, only an etage of the building had been occupied, but that the householders were in the last months in all the years of the building and almost all apartments had been added.
In this sense, he adds that "the uncleanness is needed to end and to act against the associated acts in the building."
Yesterday another building in the city quarter of Nou Barris was released by the Catholic police.
At 15.30 a.m., the police approached the road Montral No. 35 after having received a call from a neighbor who observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects are excluded from the disputes over the honorers with the exemption.
The local statement on the 16 towers opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona in New York.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the highest point of the Metropolitana de Barcelona Corporation, this administration published its secretary on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a big park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
In 1987, the park was back in the eyes of many to the top border of Barcelona, because the capital city of Catalonia belongs to the few who are not spread in the north-south direction, but to the top (Geberge) and below (Sea).
The Collserolas instruction plays this idea as a natural park.
As an example, the Central Park served no longer, but Yellowstone with wild wheat in the role of Yogibar.
As far as the city was in September a riesen statement from 16 competitions, for other accessors to Collserola.
Unfortunately, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Or it's like this, or someone's supposed to put the doors on the country.
The question is: Collserola, Park or Mount?
The statement is not only from organizational view, but also in view of a reflection on the city, the prehema in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recruiting topic that can return to the two members of this old box, which take place in the motion.
And exactly this fact offers the substance for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professionals who have been subject to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The exhibition is suitable.
For Roldán "is necessary" after the attack on the coast on the "Front on the mountain" as long as the talk of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been used over the green epics.
"Man should come out of the Prince that Barcelona's largest park of the beach is.
In addition, because he's well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect for which the title "Tore of Collserola" provides a "lexical case" for: "It is not possible to imagine it as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which to be treated."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with town-building experience, considers the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", which offers "one" in itself.
Following the "uncertainty that brings up a public ra's building today" after the experiences of the 1980s that have been in the area of For ́ their "scanners".
The first care is the own limitation of what can be built.
"It means always to limit something to fix the next step," it is, for example, to override it.
"You must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current [appealing to General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, which is more aware of the question, simplifys that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, " can be understood as a park that doesn't be in Barcelona" and for pure topographic reasons.
Modol notes that there is already a halt of Patronat de Collserola that should not be "bound on baptism ears", although he is grateful to the city manager that she has given Gremium the possibility to contribute to this project "for the first time to".
He notes that the nearby of the mountain to the city of the leading letter, which allows the architects to share in the debate, although he expresses his "double" to whether this technical profile should be the multidiscriminal teams called in life ("the right," he says, "We are architects should be only a tool."
Bayona notes that the answer to the question is complex in the heading of this article, since in the statement conditions, a global view of Collserola has failed: "16 competitions have been issued in the middle," he says, "in the axis of the mountain-sea. But there are no longer-term perspectives looking at the area in general."
At least, in cases of participation in 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gate would colide with the architect of the port.
Se ● Consideration should ensure that the city is directly equipped over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which occurs a small cross between the city and the Green Zone.
Casino forgave Jonas Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of weakness, the companion of Casino Red delivered the brother of the citizen of Monterrey's citizen from the process that is led against him because of mutual pressure.
After 72 days of prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the complaint of Casino Red has forgiven him before the Second Court of Justice of the District, which leads to the process against the brother of the citizen of Monterrey for pressure.
After the accent on the Casino Royale published by Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to see, which urges him to pay a sum of money so that the city manager may approve the secret operation of the law.
After the penalty, the State advocate opened a penalty procedure against the brother of the Panist citizen, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the officer of the Ministry of Public 3 and Delitos Patrimonials, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place, he remained 49 days after a second arrest order, after the officer of the Ministry of Publico had distorted the criminals for the offence and organised crimes.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta's captivity because he had courageously visited the Casino Red owner with one half million pesos. However, he stayed just a few hours in the Mediterranean Safety Track, since he suggested murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court procedure as an insect of the State prison by San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Court of Justice, Jorge Yánez, was assigned to him a court regulation, which stated that after the nearly two months of investigation, there were sufficient evidence in order to speak for the payment of 1,5 million persons to the representatives of the House in order to open it in contrast.
This Monday, the companion of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the citizen, to be punished, therefore, in the next hours.
In the case of the judicial consultation, Ramiro Arias, the officer of the Ministerial of the Court of Justice, García Gómez, asked whether he had undergone the damage and who had expressed his forgiveness by the owner of the House. However, the lawyer kept the name back.
According to the Act of 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken, and there can also be no injury against the process, and no refund is required.
After hearing the author of the law against 15.50, Larrazabal Breton was immediately placed on free foot.
The Secretary of Justice, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonás that he was released and that his case would be put to the acts.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome provides details about the accident of the aircraft in which the Governing Secretary Francisco Blake and other seven persons came to life.
The Secretariat de Communications y Transportes - SCT (Communication and Transport Secretariat in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation on the accident in which the Governing Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and the other seven persons had come to life indicate that the hub screener was directly discussed with its entire unwanted structure, without that the pilot could have introduced a note.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Yacome, secretary for communication and transport, said that the pilot would have visited before the start, the conditions of advertising were appropriate for the flight.
"The story that the propeller flight had contact with trees in 25 meters height, whereas the hubwrapper lost the rubber, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several land contacts. "
He also explained that the rubber was built for 19 insects, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
▪ He said that in the investigations in the area where the machine was missed, there were no hubs.
"In the search, no parts of the aircraft were found in other places, with the whole structure.
The buyer was built for 19 insects, therefore he fulfilled all conditions for the person's transport.
The area shows a degree of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is essential to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, however, these several months, perhaps even a year.
The Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Services Auxiliares (Secretariat for Flights and Services in Mexico), was assured that the shipwrapper by the State Mayor presidential had fallen in a small depth.
"This information strengthens the adoption of a normal flight operation at the time of the approximation."
At a press conference, the leader of the SCT, Pérez Yacome, had six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
View speed:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight in accordance with the rules of the flight, which means that the mastership had to have enough view during the flight and the ground.
Enhancement conditions:
The AICM held appropriate warning conditions at the start. The continued flight in direction of the border area between Mexico and Mexico State . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Selected speeds:
It is possible that the community has chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca number.
Training:
The surface coordinates and the latest radio recording of the hazards are agreed. It may not have given a loss of control on the aircraft or a divergence of the aircraft before the driving.
Expansion of the residues of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information forward to the present time indicated that the rubber was exhausted from the right and side direction.
The pattern of dispersed aircrafts believes that the hub shooter was spread up with its inherited structure on the ground.
No indication on fire or explosion:
The rest of the aircraft offers neither on the accident or on the explosion.
The recent results of the investigation have been reported to several land contacts.
In the location studies, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above the sea level. The area is cut off and shows a degree of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the rubber is probably breaking.
Some information indicates that the hubs could have had several land contacts.
Following a minuous search in a area that passed over the locked area in the accident, no splitted aircraft parts were found, which strengthened the adoption that the unreversed aircraft structure was discussed against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for fatality
It leads to a research project to find the gene for failure in children and youths supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insuranceanstalt Mexico) announced that there is a research project to discover the gene of vitality in children and youths under the title "Genetics of vitality in children and youths" with which the genetic marks should be found with overweight.
Miguel ́z López, leader of the Unidad de Investigation Medica en Bioquímica (Department for Medicinal Research, Point of Biochemie) at the clinic Hospital de Specialities del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a interdiscriminary team was built by doctors, hospitalists, Ernä’s specialists and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and students of post-graded studies at Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigation y de Studies Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the area. Interests can come to the sports places of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and youths are performed every Sunday at 8.00 p.m.
He noted that the investigation started at the Sportplace of Cuauhtemoc (in the western of the Federal State of Mexico) and continued since 8 October on the sportplace of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the Federal State of Mexico).
If the goal of 500 to 600 researchers is reached, the sports place of Independence (south of the capital beach) will continue and will be completed by Morelos (in the north of the capital village).
He explained that the goal of the objective is to learn from the genetics and the role of the development of vitality and the Implementation of risk factors of mexican children and youth to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
In view of the worldly day of the diabetes, he explained that it would be a pleasure that three thousand children and youths in the age of six to 14 years should comply with the comprehension and with the view of their parents.
They will also be asked about their corporate A > and their own-related disease history to control risk factors that can result in diabetes or renal insufficiency.
In addition, he highlighted that the studies (weight, size, tail volume), their blood pressure and blood values, such as glucose level, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic erythetics, would be identified in the respective sampling.
López highlighted that this study would be conducted in the event of the health care of the alarming weight of young people.
"The health issues from 1999 and 2006 indicated that in at least six years, the share of a fatigue boy has increased by 77% and that the girls have increased by 47% in gravity, and the overweight has also increased dramaticly," stated the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the search for genetic marks was based because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was distinguished from the other people.
He indicated that a (e) Mexico (in) average of 65% of Indian-American, 30% more and 5% of African decline is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetic inflammation is pressured in the ability to burn the extent of the energy taken to us (calories) so that this is in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits for the investigators were in a comprehensive study of the children, where they would be determined whether they would show a degree of overweight or insufficiency.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin pellets in the naked and inner arm (ananthosis), which indicate the probability of drug change events and diabetes in the pre-stadium.
All information would be treated with confidentiality and reported to parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors declare to parents all the results of meat and propose changes in lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
López explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for overweight, fatality and other chronic diseases: disturbance, which means failure of movement every day, to transport the most time of the day before the televisor and to use transport, rather than to go short ways to foot.
The high calories collection, which means increased consumption of sugar drinks and carbonhydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.) and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Assistance prevented by UNAM
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the chemical faculty at the UNAM University developed with polymers modi-operated asylums in order to make the mixture resisting conditions and temperature reductions
If the characters that come from the roadband were considered, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 trailers when the rain time in the Zone Metropolitana del Valle de México (City of Mexico valley), Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the Chemical Faculty (FQ) at the UNAM University, warning and warning that if the exhibition and maintenance of the asphalt plague would be appropriately reduced significantly or even completely avoided.
In the proposal "Thics of technical view", which he held at the international year to chemicals, he provided that the lab for which he was responsible for developed with polymers modiworked asylums to produce a similar mixture to the ashl, but a higher mechanical resistance at high and low temperatures.
Mrera Najera thought that this kind of moderate asylum in regions with extremely warm climate , such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road campaign and to avoid the occurrence of shocks.
He explained that the asphalt, the most severe part of the earth oil, is a coalwater connection from which a part has a high molecular weight - which is a lower assistance - and the other part a low - that is Malthene.
The asphalt teethical behaviour means that it is at high temperatures of approximately 180°C as a liquidity, at 120°C it is very deeply fixed and at 50°C, while it is used at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistability of the asphalt on the streets is not equal, but changes on a day depending on the conditions and temperatures," did the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City were mostly having a flexible strategy, which consisted of six material checks from which the last three asphalts included.
Among the highest shields there is a shadow of asphalt that is based out small, in asphalt and then stumbled stones.
Each single stone of this shirt is built in asphalt.
When the vehicles continue to move and make powers on it, this shift allows a power distribution in the road stock.
"If there was a modi-best asphalt, the powers would be better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"On the scarlet," he said, "the last shirt will be exposed, which is called the tragedy that consists of winning stones, such as sand, which was also built in asphalt.
Since these shifts are in contact with the trailers, they need a greater mechanical power than the disorder, and they need to make recycling.
The most powers are received and distributed by these streets, the tragedy also needs a suitable dick and the material from which it consists.
The conditions of refreshment, especially heat and temperature degradation, are further, important to be taken into account, for all things the water," he said, "which it affects significantly the behavior of the disturbance.
When the landscape is sown, the water gets into the shadow and only turns out difficultly. This causes all the shields of the streets and thus the occurrence of shocks.
When a crack occurs, he said, "the deck will be removed before the deck, while the disorder is first affected. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be held at the first signs by appropriate warning programmes."
The member of the National de Investigadores System (National Research System Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is a further important cause for the occurrence of shocks. Therefore, the depth of each road stock must always be in relation to the vehicle load and must be assured that this scheme will be fulfilled to avoid frequencies.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many other research works were waiting for, for example, about asphalt emulsions that are even on the market in other countries, and with which the locks were simply and without the application of high temperatures.
What did the Candidatin del Valle fail to be the new Miss Koöei?
Analysis of those who affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Koquéien.
El Valle receives his 14th mistake title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty in the delivery of the crone for Miss Koöei.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winerpodium, putting a silver crown and the band she showed as a new Miss Koquéien.
With the result of this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the Krone and Zeder, the Department has already come to 14 mistitles and Melina is associated with the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which had nearly held the crown in the hands. The proclamed misses belong to: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), −rra Domingguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garces Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garces Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask today is: What was wrong?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, which had shown that they were over everything to be the new Miss Koöei. In addition, it was chosen to the Queen of the Police and to the Major Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received the nice Queen Talian Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Koekieia with home.
The first, which is as decisive for the decision of the Jury to call her first Miss, is that she had not convinced her that the answer to the question "What book has most affected you and why?" Martín Murillo Gómez had submitted by Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca told the questionnaire:
"I read much, I believe pretty in the literature, I think it's a sort of civilization, let me believe that the book that for my childhood was the most strongest, 'The little prince' is a very deeply gone book.
It is a book of the universal culture that we all should read. I just read a book of Irene Nemirowski, a Russian, a beautiful book that is called `sulderships'.
An answer that puts on a little opposite, first because of the term `civilization' and second, because she did not explain exactly how each of her mentioned books had influenced her.
But after the end of the ceremony, Melina explained to feel quiet and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what must happen.
And for all people: Please read a little `the little prince'. It is a wonderful book.
In addition, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned.
A journalist from Bogota noted that the fact that she was the preferred of all the cases that had received all the prices (Gastronomy Competition of Oster, public vote on the best hand-constrainted costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had easily made what the Queen stressed, which could therefore not be able to slight."
And this was observed at their first presentation at the bathroom on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at their two moves at the crying festival.
Although it was safe at both, she had failed to see the strength and the weight that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico had.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en house" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was ratified to Miss shows that the Candidatin, who wins most prices during the competition, would not be the Queen."
Valle went to the close of the press from the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about their interest in social work, which is the key of the national goodness requirement.
It will have its reason for two days before the composition of the international Jury Lucy Doughty, they seek a woman who was involved in the social issues of their country.
"The opportunity is not only enough for a Miss Kopécia; it is necessary to look over the body and be able to get on the social receipt, that she had already been involved in the competition of projects before it was joined," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned with its defects of the The Earth and the Fibrose, which you have noticed in the magic. But that is contrary, because the Jury chose her as candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good food habits and responsible corporate work.
The tree of the Queenin, Jorge Hernán Orozco, says that Melina didn't have the best body that it would be better, "but her problem with the fibrose on the bow, which was just not to note for me, ß their number of points last day."
Thus, the journalist Guido Hoyos from the Cromos magazine of the opinion that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the chirurgical attacks she had understood.
"The operations are all right, but Valle didn't know how she should make it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place must have killed them."
Because of this price, which is first forgiven by the National Beauty Requirement, has occurred a cruel preview that should be observed in the night. Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price to not allow them to come into the joy of the crown.
Anyway, whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina comes from today, not as a Queen, but as a princess, a position that gives you the possibility to represent the national beauty law in one of the international competitions.
However, she will be one of the Queen, who, despite her overwhelming rebellion for Cartagena, entered the crown into the story.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscop from Cali went as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano" into the story.
The work of these employees plays a key role.
In the past 4 November, a lophoscope of the State Advocate Unit (CTI) from Cali as the man who visited the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary combat forces Kouciens) included "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
From the seven lophoscops in the CTI Department, this week Eliazar González had preparation service, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years in criminal investigation procedures.
At the beginning of his Karee González in the communities of Chocó, where he often had to be in the jungle for five days to get the place where the bodys he had to identify.
2000 he sent over after Valle and after the time of the needed course, he specialized himself on the lophoscope, which is the investigation of the skin, which has been exhausted, e.g. the hand and foot areas.
In the week of the use against the Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was noted to packaging clothing for at least three days.
Something great expected him.
Friday night, he fled in the Palmira's hobby to Cauca.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies, and that the deceased was that one of the man who led the old Guerrilla of the world could be able to take the ten finger print table of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because this compared the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no bar, was like a builder of the area clothed, no brilliant and was very dark.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Weapons with a lupe, tint, a pf cell and a box lamp compares Eliazar the fingerprints of the body with those on the printing sheet.
He had seen right: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to inform that it was actually the leader of the FARC.
Searching for tracks
For a Daktyloscope from Sijjan in Cali, the estimation that President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González had been granted at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
People don't know our work.
The Daktyloscopy is a precise economy without a bug quota that can be a key factor in the resolution of a criminal.
Lophoscopests not only identifie bodys, they also investigate in murder and crafts cases and identify the efficiency of the persons arrested.
When they are arrested, many criminals presented false evidence papers or they have no.
We'll take their fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to throw a piece of wall out of a house at a deep steel, because the deb had just opened up in this place with his hand, when he dropped out a full safe with shock and money.
"The walls are hard because their surfaces are inappropriate for the reduction of fingerprints, but in this case we could take the printing of the whole hand and identify the criminals who had shared in several debt sticks," he noted.
As a result of fingerprints, killers can also be charged or charged.
Recently, a killer was located by snapshots.
In the investigation, a family member could be aware and actually agreed with a fingerprint on the flash.
Although this doesn't guarantee that it is the murderer, it will be related to the place where the penalty has been committed.
A dactyloscope of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reactions."
If they appear, a pf cell or a band will be used to be taken.
Afterwards, the pressures are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or personal staff.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without evidence papers," explained the CTI expert.
He thought not everything would be like it would be shown in the TV series.
Like not all gold, which is clear, it isn't all that you take, a fingerprint.
Yet, it can be used to perform a corresponding comparison.
The "imperty" calls the authorities in New York out
Hundreds of demonstrants were joined in Zelts on the Zuccotti place.
A majority came to the space order and changed his location to a nearby placed park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street Movement requested the New York authorities this Thursday when they tried to return to the Manhattan Place after they were released from the place on the morning, and attempted to place another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrants joined themselves before the Zuccotti place, on which they had a legal order that allowed the "imputers" to make access to the new cities in this place. Thus, there was another part of the movement to the room order and put a park on the north of the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the Court doesn't allow us to camp in the place, we'll meet ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstration," Mark Bray said, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray concluded that the response of the "emputs" to the space of their cell layer, which was directly assigned by Michael Bloomberg, the citizen of New York, until the court came, where judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the violent space of the place and approved the demonstraints.
The "imperty" occupied a new park that is connected to the crossing of the Central Channel Street and the Sixth Avenue close to the introduction to the Holland tunnel, New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to place the place at least a hour, but afterwards, the police met and arrested some of the demonstrants, though Bray could not give exact numbers. He assured the news agent Efe that he also saw several journalists with hands.
The organization assured that hundreds of people would have been found in this place, where also a decree of religious leaders were found as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and to interfere with the police.
Instead, the Zuccotti-Location (a land in property) is closed in the expectation of a judicial consultation still established for this Friday and in which the legality of the space located in the morning greenhouse should be analysed.
Some of the demonstrants made photocopies of this legal arrangement and distributed them. They even gave some police who watched the place, which had "second small conferences", as Bray reported, who had shown, some police have killed demonstrants.
The Court of Justice prohibits the authorities to release members of Occupy Wall Street from the place, and to apply the "Seeds which have been prohibited after the condition and to prohibit the demonstrators to return to the park with their cells and other things they used before."
The citizen Bloomberg clears the press that on the basis of this judgement, the re-opening of the place for public traffic and the demonstrants has been re-opened. The demonstrants showed that the city laws did not allow them to re-configure in this place with salts and slaughter.
The citizen master defended personally the space of the Zuccotti place in which almost 200 people were arrested, and they were determined because the demonstrators were "forbidden the right."
Bloomberg explained that he would have given the order for the spacing of the place because he had "converted himself into a place to which people were not to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to add damage to other people," because "second business would have received threats" and the inhabitants feared "for their quality of life".
"The space in the morning green was fair and shows that Bloomberg is in the light of the protection of the financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of the North American workers," said the speakers of the movement, who claimed to "not respect the press freedom".
The responsibility of Occupy Wall Street informed that they thought to organize "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and workshops, to remember the two months that the protests have been held since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the girlfriend Maria in the TV nightshow
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian scientists, they will appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens assistant in "Home Improvement", a backup in "Baywatch", a caninch at "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the player and model will be the girlfriend of the Canadian TV.
The private television CTV has given today that Anderson with the "crooner" (Balladensensor) Michael Bublé and other Canadian experiences on 1 December in the TV program "It's Peters Christmas" and a very special girlfriend Maria will have life.
CTV today broadcasts pictures of the television program, in which Anderson - which also appears for the spread in the Internet of a self-dressed porno, where she appears together with her former husband, the player of "Möthley Crüe", Tommy Lee, with a puppet in the shot that Jesus should show.
In the scene, Peters, a Canadian comicer of Indian origin, appears recently as a modernist at the sending "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen 日, as Jesuskind.
The Wednesday Programme of CTV is not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian song Bublé, the end of March in Buenos Aires, who married the argentinic model Luisana Lopilato, which is not remote.
Recently, Bublé had made the North American Kim Kardashian as "Hour" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is born again after the earthquake
The BIP w's about 1,5% thanks for the internal consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since the last march, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still in the genetic treatment of the Seresherian earthquake, which invoked into a atomic crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had learned of the Second World War.
The first rates of the Government in Tokyo evaluated the sequences of 300 000, which seems to be devastated despite the weak world economy.
Following three quarters, the information on the Brutto-in-land product from July to September served to end this chapter: the PIB increased by 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the high-related quota for the year.
The second quarter value - in Japan starts the business year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since January to March 2010.
The rebuilding may be partly explained by the machinery rebuilding for the rebuilding of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the following Tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investment by 1,1% compared to the decrease of 0,9% for capital facilities decreased from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unretainable increase.
However, the real environment of the Japanese economy is not based out of keysian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan was particularly observed thanks to the development of the internal consumption, which currently has 60% of the Japanese PIB.
This variable increased by 1% of the growing expenditure for vehicles, travels and free-time jobs.
The Yen Stigma
Tokyo confided in the country, after Yen, the Japanese Value, in one of the "flight currencies" of the investors who fled before the euro zone's debt crisis and the pressured prognoses for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a grobstein on the accounts of the export companies.
With a stronger choice, the products in the outerland are tougher, a serious problem for a country whose economy is addressed to the health of large technology products.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the notation of Yen.
Since the markets continue to be the periphers of the EU countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda remains awake.
"You must take care of the sustainable risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economys, the impact of the overflows in Thailand and the rapid evaluation of Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa last night.
The perspictives are really not very exciting.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) explained that most Member States would have indicated clearer signs for renewal of economic development in September.
The indicator, which provides the points of the world economy, lighted that the most economic potential would be the bremse.
Because he ran about four decades up to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone is even under this average value, which lies at 100, after it is cut about eight decades to 99.13 points.
Athen allows doubts to come again
Papadimos says that the sphere measures would be prevented, but the conservatives will not be subjected to a written agreement.
With the risk premiums of the peripher countries and its broad insecurity, Greece continues to be destroyed in the Labyrinth that results from the large responsibility crisis.
The impression that the "consense" of the new Greek transitional government is a reaction to the pressure from Brussel as a real conviction of political powers is determined quietly by facts.
As the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, last night, pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structure reforms and that the hundreds of days of its name might be shortly for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Noeva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, would return the new spacing measures under and, in any case, his request for new elections at the date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is the implementation of the decisions taken on the roof of 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday to implement a parliamentary debate, which will be achieved tomorrow with the trust vote for the new government.
A package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the right of discipline for employees and new measures against tax interaction are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, the communication of Samara does not clear the doubt of his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the government, but not to anything."
The Conservative leader went too far with its challenges from the EU and the IWF, the Organism, which needed to dislock the 8000 million, which needs the Athens, and clearly noted that it would not be able to make a good call for the inheritance of the sphere measures.
However, the European Commission, which has still been irritated because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu Referencendum, confirmed last night, would not be distorted on their request: the economic aid would not be subjected if the new government and leaders of the Greek parties would not sign "a clearly written agreement as soon as possible".
The speaker of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika "is very quickly" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is the payment of the sixth section" of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek kidney has a lot of feet.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "pre-registering" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain " has achieved a pre-registering position in the role of smallest funding."
The Queen Sofia of Spain noted last two years that Spain has developed the second view of this fund for international cooperation throughout the past two years, which "What" means that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of confidence in humans".
The Queen invoked the fifth world pipe over the smallest credits in Valladolid last night. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely unnecessary" to achieve the thousands of years covered by the United States until 2015 and "including the goal of the number of persons who must live with the income of less than one of them on the day, so under the "poverty border".
Spain also "continued" in the extension of the benefit network "to the last corner of the world, and it is responsible for this task," observed the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will be made by the gipfel to Thursday, "the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poor and particularly for women" are guaranteed as major beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have made a lot of success" and "too many challenges."
It is not only a forum for debates but also a platform for "double basic goals".
The Queen explained that until the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that → millions of these budgets will exceed the poverty limits.
The concept of smaller credits goes back in Spain and the rest of the world on the way initiated by Muhammad Yunus for years, which the Queen Sofia considers as a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financing instrument described it as a "wonderful idealist who has sent to the fight against the poverty" and whose work has known her since 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to take place the loan strategy.
This experience followed a year later the first world box in Washington and other meetings at the eleven-country coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "We can see a continuous development," the Queen explained the evaluation of his commitment for this project as "Family-noberhaupt" in Valladolid and as "power-preacher".
The Queen Sofia completed its proposal by animating the presents to participate in the debate and seeking solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical order"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "a ethical order" for the entire democratic state.
In this regard, she pointed out that it was a mistake to make development assistance at the time of economic bombs, as it is a "durational commitment".
Jiménez believed that the smallest credits were a "earliest and rigorose" to destroy the poverty and that the governments of the industrial countries had to work "more than ever" after solidarity criteria, and that they should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to be victims.
For Spain, the smallest credits are one of the "greatest forms of development assistance".
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, claimed "the success", "marginalised" people, "the always stand before closed doors" and the citizen master of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, called the presents in a city that opened "Your gates, enrolled by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose the EU President on the basis of a general vote grant
The first day of the Christian Democrats Congress (CDU on Monday, on 14 November in Leipzig, was for Angela Merkel, officer and president of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not intended in the programme, but has been implemented in heritage, especially to allow the activists to be sufficient to appreciate the Governing Policy on Greek today and perhaps Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The Presidency proposed by the European Commission was almost uniform.
Under 1001 delegates had voted only nine, but they had the vote contained.
The several minutes along standing Ovation, which, due to their intervention allowances to Angela Merkel and a few hours later, loved Wolfgang Schöuble from the three European financial ministers.
The main idea of the officer is - as the request - the following Slogan: the answer to the crisis is not less, but more Europe.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also "new million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the officer, "the time has come for a break in Europe."
This could be expressed by strengthening the monitoring of the European Union's amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon on the budgetary policy of the countries in the Eurozone; but this could, in the choice of the President of the European Commission, be based on a general vote agreement," to give Europe a view."
However, this is, in any case, one of the proposals made by the Congress, which clearly represented Wolfgang Schöuble Pate.
It is probably only little that 47 are quickly on this revolution: Grob British is the thing rejecting, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milenstein is placed.
Similarly, the delegates in a excessive majority have rejected the proposal for the weight of each country in the ECB's representation in accordance with the weight of each economy, which obviously brought up a strengthening of the position of Germany.
As a result, the Officer in the context of the climate has strengthened the reference points to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer attempted to win its congress on the costs of the "small" or the countries in difficulties that would suddenly criticize the arrogant Germany.
Since the European request for the importance of the German and French friendship is given a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds that Leipzig was in the middle of a bloody battle ago two centuries ago.
One of the most humiliating delays of the Napoleon Army.
What represents the disturbance of disease reports?
According to family assistance, UMP and the Government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will take place on Sunday on 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family assistance box and to make a talk about it - since 2007 - the subject of the fight against social disorder and the economic dependence of the State.
In order to accompany this attack, which results from the effort to submit the economy into a harvest test, however, on the other hand, not less of the offers of a axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority will be able to report workers' diseases.
To household economic goals: the Government refers to the introduction of a fourth carrier day before taking into account a notification of a disease in employees in the sector.
In good Germany, this means that a diseased employer without authorization would lose the payment for four days, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
An advancement that is due to the "Les Echos" period, however, would help to introduce 280 million euros.
And the more symbolic characteristics were to be taken by another use: to take the State officer a unforgetted karenz day in the case of illness (too long for them, in contrast to the three carence days in the sector, no carence period).
The majority of these issues also simplifies the deterioration, and this time refers to the deficiency associated with worklessness.
"The controls will be significantly more important, and these will be forbidden, if this is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November before the sender's microphone.
Like in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of disturbing actions in the areas of diseases seem to be little unproportionated.
This is actually a subject of permanent observation and political offensives that have made most often fruit.
The French are not more frequently sick than people other than people in Europe.
Let us, however, refer to the country-wide numbers.
In 2006, more than 237 million euros were paid by the country’s CNAM CNAM CNAM.
The funds of the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Institute represented 11,3 billion euro 5% of health expenditure in 2008.
Under this amount, 46% of maternal disabilities and unemployment accidents and 54% of illness authorisations, which include 6,2 billion euros.
And then 2,5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the Franceses were at the 17.8 days in 2009 as a average of the Alma Consulting Group only 14.5 days.
An average value that was disturbed by certain differences: another, in 2007 by Monster.com, the Kar planning website, showed that 75% of the 40.000 employees were asked to have no only hospital day.
Another, this time from the hospital insurance, shows that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were less than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.
In comparison with their neighbors, the French employees are therefore not more than other than working incapacity.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the French, State Centre for Economic Research (CNRS) showed that the global absent rates (based on disease or other areas) were obscilled between 1994 and 2001, while in France between 10 and 11% were 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The disturbance of disease reports is a low part of black work.
With regard to the disturbance, there is only a weak outcome here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 results in systematic controls in disease notifications that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls found that 13% of the 285.000 realised, short-term disease reports, which occur in 37.050 cases, were justified or too long.
In systematicly controlled disease reports of more than 45 days, under 1.2 million 11% were counted in "unjusted or unjustified" cases, namely 132.000.
Thus, in general, 169.000 non-justified cases of millions of employees who have made a disease message.
A number that represents only a weak exposure to those of black work, for example.
According to the UMP Deputy Dominique Tian, the reporter of a business report in July on this question, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros per year, which is more than the total amount of daily debt, and thus more than the defraudation in late numbers.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to remove its economy.
This was on Monday, on 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has announced before Parliament in addition to the fact that his Government has not set up a hundred days from the Union to perform this task.
"To continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support of our partners and a new programme for budget adjustment," said the Governing Boss in his first public talk in the debate on the trust vote of the Parliament in the middle-week.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October is the "the main task" of the new Government, since the contribution of the country within the eurozone" on the game, as it is to do.
In accordance with Mr. Papademos planned to decrease the State depth of the country's 9% of the Bruttoinland product from today to the end of the year, after that was 10,6% in 2010 and in 2009 to 15,7%.
The rights refuse the new spam derogations
Antonis Samaras, head of the right flight, had accepted its approval to the already approved mixtures in relation to a trial from the debt crisis, however, provided that his party would not be prepared for an additional suspension.
"We will not vote in favour of new adoptions," he said at the end of an advocate assembly of its Partie New Democracy.
However, he had explained the conditions of reduction of budget debt and debt, as well as the fight against destruction, was enemy to everyone who would be involved in the economic creation.
O日 Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks, concerned the EU Commissioner, who had prevented IWF and EU the necessary loans of over 8 billion euros without a written guarantee of all parties on their support for planned mixtures, had answered Antonio Samaras that his word would be sufficient and that it would not be under pressure of ovens.
Euthanation and associated freedom must be legalized as a expert body
The Canadians live in rejecting the death, as a report from the Kingdom Society of Canada
The Greece explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors are together to prepare the best painful resources, and that is also out of the cancer cases.
The Canadian Society lie in a refusal against death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually able to talk to their Ar about conditions they want to die and to take provisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Kingdom Society of Canada, in which six experts were shared in different areas, including ethics, rights and medicines.
This body recommends the Government to change the penalty law in order to allow associated suicide and euthanias to take such a decision in patients who are able to be considered to take such a decision.
As an appeal, the experts quote a recent public investigation of the independent EIU company that compared the death quality in 40 countries of the earthball.
While Canada has placed it on the 10th range, it notes that "the medical destruction of death in Canada has made a culture in which the people have had to cut the dead to the subject."
Medical maintenance or not: 77% of the Canadians do not have access to painful funds, so the experts reported by the Kingdom Society of Canada.
And despite the major desire of the Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them die at last in the hospital.
From the whole country, the rates of 86% in the hospital in Quebec were highest.
In the heavy question regarding Euthanase and the associated Suizid, the report report reports on conclusions which have been addressed by the position of the Federal Government, which has already developed, does not want to make any amendments to the penalty law concerning Euthanation and the associated suicide.
However, there is no evidence of the experts who have equivalently inspected all those countries who have legalized or decriminalised the approach of Euthanation and associated suicide, that such decriminalisation would be aware of their application, so the practical implementation of euthanation or associated suicide of non-compliant or non-admissible persons.
In contrast, more cases of such crimes are beginning just in the countries where Euthanation and associated Suizid are not legalized, such as Jocelyn Downie, the co-operator of the report, in a telecommunication.
"Euthanation is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"And the associated Suizid is practiced in Canada, despite this is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie said.
Canadians Preserve Euthanania
Let us compare that, as a result of an issue of a reid in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had already been developed in favour of Euthanase, because they believe that it allowed people to strengthen their suffering at the end of their life path.
And 66% believe that the detention of a legitimization of Euthanation does not result in providing the message that life of older or deteriorated people is less valueful.
As regards those who have already practiced an associated suicide, the applicants are 41% of the opinion that they should not be persecuted criminally.
As regards the maintenance or station of the resources in patients, the situation is less clear, so the reporter.
Similarly, they draw close to their Recommendation List that the penalty law should specify that the removal of the funds for which a legal deliberation has been made should not apply as criminal.
Furthermore, the expert institution calls for the education of health experts in the task to respect the removal of the funds at the end of life, and this must be feared without criminal persecution.
The Greece explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors are together to prepare the best painful resources, and that is also out of the cancer cases.
Tolet’s requests to take them into account in relation to the health care funds already used in the Canadian institutions to reduce physical pains and to address them to the same procedures.
Preserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health have already provided reservations in relation to the conclusions of the report of the Kings of the Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has taken the holding of the reporting experts, including "extrem" because this of the euthhanic practice in patients in the end phase does not set any limits.
"This opens the points for a situation in which everyone who is lifetime and older than 18 years is to ask another person to be helped by himself," said RA Deschamps, who had considered a summary of the report last night.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the representatives of the report seemed to have the own responsibility of the individual over all other values shared in the social force of the society.
But, as he says, there are guidelines and commitments in a society.
Margaret Somerville, specialist for health rights, has also made a strong opposition to the conclusions of the report that it has entitled "Pro-Euthanation Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Kingdom Society of Canada, doubts, in particular, the reports regarding the non-execution of crimes in certain countries where euthanism and associated suicide are legalized, for example, in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls the President Assad for a powerful attack
A "Complot" applies to
It is apparently isolated
The parties of Baschar al-Assads have demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Auvens.
The diplomatic pressure on the Baschar al-Assads, which, however, responds to Russia's support and shows a "Complott" against the country, has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the exhaustion of the Arab Liga, the European Union has enhanced its sanctions against the Church, although Turkey and Jordan, the Neighbourhood countries, had taken a position for a derogation from President Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan, he was the officer of the Arab Prime Minister, which president Baschar al-Assad had invited to decrease his authority, which was already killed by the fourty civilians and members of the government.
"If Bascar is the interest of his country in heart, he would depart, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of the political Syrian life," as the King of Jordan, Neighbourland, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomatic leader Ahmet Davutoglu, on his side, was complained that since the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime, Turkish mediation trials had not been successful.
"They in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and are not able to satisfy it must go," he explained in an example to the neighborhood country to which Turkey takes a closer attitude.
The United States have, on the other hand, confirmed the "depreciation of the consensus against Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" according to the decisions of the Arab Liga and of the European Union.
"The International Community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Liga and the countries such as Turkey have increasingly increasing sounds," Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department, observed.
In this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the Government power in the region of Dar'a in the Southern region were dead, the Syrian observer for human rights OSDH announced.
Two other civilians said that this NGO was in the "schouse changes and severe bombing calls for jobs" in the hosted town of HOMs.
On the basis of a press conference, the Syrian minister Walid al-Muallim, however, believed that the country was "taxed to the end of the crisis".
Moreover, he insisted on the conclusion of the Arab Liga to suspend his tasks, responding to what his appreciation represents after a "periodic step".
"Nothing will be followed," he added, "the complaints that would fail against prevented."
According to the Suspension Decision, the Arab Liga currently examines a "shot mechanism for civilians" and wants the sending of 500 members of the Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French minister Alain Juppé had also spoken for the UN observators' sending to civilians before the Requime's repression that he was captured after his "Paranoia" to stand on his side.
A re-planned new assembly of the Liga is intended in the Rabat for the morning to examine the implementation of the crisis outcome plan on 2 November, in particular the restricted, prospective discharge of military troops from the hosted cities and the freedom of prisoned demonstrators.
The Russian Auven Ministry Sergej Lawrow took the decision of the Arab Liga last night as an "incorrect" to protect himself from providing any sanctions against the Church, although China had already encouraged China to implement the crisis emergency plan.
Italy
Monti calls the markets for patience and Italy for sacrifice preparation on
Mario Monti, the future Italian Governing Boss, has requested the markets a little more time to build his staff and to implement a program to send "offs" to recover the lost creditability of Berlusconi during the last months.
The former Commissioner of the EU has held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before the present meeting of businesses and employees.
It was his task to call a cabinet into Parliament, which is relatively strict from external technologies.
"Monti has spoken of a major programme with a number of victims," so Francesco Nucara, a lawyer of one of the many smaller groups of parliamentary groups who participate in the talks after he was met with the official President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Deputy Chamber, had to wait on its side that Mario Monti would put a trust vote to the Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new government was adequately supported.
In the presentation of Mr. Monti, the departments will be listed in the presentation of a stream list which, of course, will take place from a decade of ministers to the Governing Boss Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented that the intense nervousness of the bridges and obligations markets requested their time.
In a "democracy there are certain terms" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it is "certain that the markets will be duly and comprehensive."
His order by the President was confirmed by the markets, but the disturbance was re-enhanced, especially after an unexpected industrial production reduction in the Eurozone in September.
The official Prime Minister was to establish a stab from primary technologies, although he had insisted that he would like to join "politicals".
The new Government should be estimated only until 2013, on the date of the next Parliamentary elections.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Deputy Chamber, the new government should receive the trust evidence of Parliament until Friday.
Mr. Monti has committed his function to work in the meaning of the goal to make Italy "renew protagonists" in Europe.
A speaker of the EU Commissioner O日 Rehn had pointed out that "the diagnosis of our diagnosis against the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of the budgetary balance in 2013, despite the sphere plans taken in these last months, has in particular requested new hardware exemptions.
Emma Marcegaglia"Chefin of the Chefs" of Italy, which will be met on Monti on Sunday, is also on the need of the economic currency",which a country that has no growth that can't respect the characteristics."
Mr. Monti, who is for his competence and his independence as a EU Commissioner (1994-2004), is for a "Epochen Change" Italian after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "demand of confidence" and "Other Italy" as the leaders.
The grew unknown with this means the long life of his stabe.
The President Napolitano would like to prevent choices, since Italy has reached 200 billion Euro State obligations from now to April 2012.
Russian economies help the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian professional, Wjatcheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a nuclear weapons-use capsule, thus a specialized, `ananic NGO on Monday.
The Institute for Equipment and International Security ISIS bases the result on the recent report of the International Atom Security Agency AIEA and other documents from this UN Agency for the investigation of this Community.
The AIEA has notified its "primary orgasm" last week as a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the entrance of the AIEA documents since ISIS, Danilenko was manifest since the beginning of the 60s over three years had been held in a Soviet military nuclear space in Chelseabinsk (Ural) and was shared in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to create a company in Kiew that makes "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine in 1995.
Before he returned to Russia, he thus contributed to a Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA 'Starke indicated that the Iranian development has been supported by the work of a foreign expert who has developed not only in this technology but also, as a Member of the Agency has notified, the whole of his famous carriage on this technology was directly implemented in the military nuclear energy programme of its country'.
Anti-islamic crimes and delictes have increased by 50%
The crimes and delictes against Muslims have been reduced to 50% from 2009 to 2010, however, other racial or religious motivated violence crimes have been easily returned or have just increased.
According to these data, the total number of violence crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, so 49 per cent, however, a 13 per cent increase of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease against Jews and a global increase of 14 per cent in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total "hazard crime" numbers are in very weak mave to 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, as the FBI.
"With a decree in 2009, it is unfortunate to see these crimes and crimes again," the Human Rights Organization pointed out.The growth of anti-islamic violences is especially significant," so the organization added to a communication.
"Human Rights First had a long time to be pointed out that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, should be considered as a serious legal offence against human rights," Paul Legendre, a responsibility of the organization.
"The Government of the Ananias can and should do more to combat these crimes," he added to appreciate that this could be carried out by improving the policeal attitude towards "hazard crimes".
The "hess crime" in the Association Act is an inheritance from the epoch of the battle for civil rights.
This legislation was determined after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violent persons who are guided against race, skin color, religion or abstinence and now also include criminal criminality.
Twitter walks the platform and always likes more Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes in the presentation of their platform on Monday to enable their users in particular to watch the A’s of those who follow their entries, which allows the service to be more like Facebook.
The new tab "A" and another name" allows better reading live compliance with the A's other'Twitters' A's, the Internet user, whose messages ("Tweets") are followed and followed by your messages.
This allows us to find out whether these are allowed to follow their messages, whether they subscribe new contributions, favorize certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before his general Internet broadcast on Montag'im August at a small prosecution of users', the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner gave the French Presseagent AFP.
Twitter was for his little instinct functioning, convinced with something istheric encouraged wordword (RT for the reference repetition of the contributions of another person). Followfriday for recommending to follow another user) which makes the happiness of the initiatives, thus opens a public more large with a manage more comparable a that of the large public network Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed with certain "Tweets" on the Internet about this innovation.
"This is unusual, incredible and similar to very Facebook," writes @imb123.
"The function "A" will help me to better follow certain elements of my Flux-Twitters," rejected @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of an "old budget rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christ Democratic Coalition in Austria decided on Sunday to include a "Goldene budget rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation of rating agencies in the top Bonity of Austria (AAA).
It was the social democratic officer Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Ministerial Council, although the public Austrian State debt was 74.6%, so the criteria of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly under the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payability doesn't seem to have an AAA's shock on AA+, we should pay three billion euro rates each year," said Michael Spindelegger, Vize-Canzler and Christian Democratic Auvenian Minister.
Austria also provides a request for the Brussels of the Eurozone Member States of 26 October: The Governing Boss would have soon requested the reduction of public deutes until the end of 2012 and a return to the public account equivalent weight in the Constitution or by adopting a equal law.
This is what the Austrian government adopted is like the "German Model", since Germany was the first country which had included such "regulation" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget should be decreased by 0.75% of the Brutto-Indeland product (BIP) each year, since 2017 the structural budget debt of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35% of the GDP, however, regional countries should also show balanced budgets as the commons.
The objective is to exclude the budget debt in the Horizon 2020/21 under the 60% criteria set out by the Maastricht Agreement.
Starker Yen
Noda drows with a new intervention on the wheel markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Sunday that the Japanese officer would again intervene on the wall markets if the Yen should continue to grow.
"If we make an excessive volatility" in the Yen's exchange currency, we will also intervene as we have done the last time," Mr. Noda said in the senate.
On Tuesday, Yen was renewed near the historical level that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On this day, Tokyo massive Yen had been able to reduce the Japanese devise value, which is to control a new record value since 1945.
However, Yen is regularly baptised by the buying of investors who view Yen as a "value of flexibility" in these insecure times of world economic distortion and debt crisis in Europe.
The euro was fallen on Thursday under 77 Yen, the symbolic late of 105 Yen was sent near the level that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, it noted about the 120 Yen, the euro more than 160 Yen.
This electricity fire of the Japanese Devise damages the exports of the archipel, since the costs of the "Made product in Japan" and reduces the income value of Japanese companies from the outerland, since they turn them into landswalk.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and Tsunami on 11 March, who destroyed the region Tohoku (Nordosten), for his rebuilding," Mr. Noda, who cares that the yen's heating can kill the weak rise already.
In comparison with the previous quarter of this year, the economic environment has increased -1,5% with the growth in the Quartal for the first time of this year, thanks to the exhaustive export increases and the consumption of "plombed" households again.
The Prime Minister, however, appreciates that the Yen's ornament does not reflect the Japan's economic funds.
The Financial Minister Jun Azumi, on his side, invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), who opened a second-day meeting of its political committee on Thursday, in order to take all the earthly mixtures to strengthen the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, the representative of the Institute, has noticed that BoJ has already started "added receptions", which makes it reliable that the middle-week would not have been expected to be locked.
According to the last meeting end of October, the notebank had increased its State obligations purchases of 5.000 billion Yen (47 billion euros) to increase the 55.000 billion Yen (519 billion euros) covering amounts used for different financial titles to overcome the liquidity.
Eurozone:
Indents quickly in the height, bridges make backwards
The risk of the debt crisis is undetermined to constant recognition numbers.
Despite the Office of the new Government heads in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth in France and Germany, the Council continues to increase.
The bridges, still concerned about the stability of the Eurozone, also worked on Sunday, on 15 November, a little more in negative areas.
In Paris, the CAC lost at 10 hours 1,4% and fell on 3.064 points.
The dax in Frankfurt returned to 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Father than the new spendings relating to the rendies of State awards in which the Eurozone is in difficulties, the world's asset market continues to produce a part of its recent winning.
"The capital investors are nervous and are only too well conscious of the risk of depreciation," says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Presse Agency Re©s.
The Tokyo bridge, which, on its side, was the renewed fear of the market shareholders in respect of the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continued to endure, had concluded with a base of 0.7%.
"Japan has also directed his eyes to Europe as the world, and the trade moves to a limited variation corridor while investors have no evidence that the situation has been stabilised," appreciates the Compassionate Akino, the Fonds Management of Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This re-release of the care of the future of the Eurozone will damage the unitary wage that continues its bathroom on Thursday.
The euro moves to the lowest level since one half months.
Once 10 hours, the currency value was 1.3570 dollars, so it was 0.4%.
According to the boursenmakers, she returned after the CDU, the Partie of the Officer Angela Merkel, who had gathered himself in the Congress on Monday, had placed a request which, in particular, provides the possibility of countries in difficulties to get out of the Eurozone without left the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish Councils are far under the 6% green.
The loans of Italy and Spain continue to be at a very disturbing level.
This Thursday morning, the rental of the Italian Obligity reached at 10 years of 6,85%, which was 6,2% of the Spanish Title.
These spendings of price rats in Southern countries, but also in France, continue to draw close to investors' cares.
The future Italian Governing Boss Mario Monti requested more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by leaving by the debt charge in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, on the other hand, had made the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October of the Eurozone "the main task" of his Government.
Spain is located in the markets view, since on Sunday the Parliament's elections are located in the country.
The rate ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year-old community has reached a new, historical height again.
In the expectation of growth numbers of the euro zone
Statistically seen, France has buyed a economic growth of 0.4% in the quarter, so a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the statistical Federal Authority INSEE had revised the base of the numbers of the second quarter, with a minimum of 0.1% of the Brutto-Inland product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that the economic experts are most disturbing.
Dutch had to decrease a growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first height of the entire euro zone is expected at 11 hours and the EU Commission warns the risk of renewable recession.
Energy policy:
Dogments should be seen
If there is a subject that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and the costs of electricity affect the purchasing force and competitiveness of the companies directly.
It is reasonable to take a choice to access, to think about this and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be fruited if it shall submit the total economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution has a duplication of electricity request until 2050, a large part of the world’s population should not be sent to a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the reduction of fossile resources to continue to produce electricity without the forced need for reducing the gas emissions, one of which is missing from the environmental debate, to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany has continued to be isolated in his decision to disturb nuclear power.
This is not the case in which its decision is necessary to find a substituteable source, nor in Switzerland, which is currently intended to build nuclear powers of the last generation.
However, Greece, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil to be called only some States, they continue to follow their projects with desloyality.
The United States, on their side, decided to join their park another unit by taking back operation of the work of Three Mile Island after the atomic accident.
Even if the German model is sometimes placed on renewable energy sources, the reality is contrary to the talk.
The election in Berlin will be reduced in the form of defense of the electricity price, an energetical dependence increased by the increased reduction in import gas gases, in particular from Russia, increasing CO2 emissions caused by gas and carbon.
The total of these uncomfortable effects will be observed in few months.
The case of Denmark gives an opportunity to think.
Danish is one of the most powerful users of carbon and gas used by wind energy, and therefore its CO2 exhausts and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% of each other than the corresponding average.
Thanks to the sustainability of our energy policy, our neighbors are in contrast with our French households of 40% of electricity.
Since the energy price in the globalized economy is a key role of competitiveness and a stability of the industry on national ground, the French companies have a benefit from the most beneficial electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction on the atmospheric force would take into account a strong growth of the energy price, which will be read of the enormous statements on the reindustrialisation of our country and the protection of the purchase force to illusion.
Inquiries showed that it is a price that the major majority of the French is also ready to cover, as it allows the opposition to the principle of this energy source.
Let us consider that our country's energy policy has enabled to build a industrial weight of 125.00 direct and 41.000 induced jobs.
As a result of its strong export characters, it brings a number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them unnumberable workplaces.
If France takes the decision to increase from the nuclear power, a majority of these SMEs would be victim, and the 6 billion euros annually on investment and nuclear energy exports would be more and more together.
Which electricity would be an appropriated EPR to work for sixty years if the reduction of its production was planned?
In order to solve the energetical equation, you must conclude that there is a wonderful means to produce electricity as well as a devil work.
Areva developed, CO2 arm solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy result from the complementarity of energy sources.
The maximum possible safety level for nuclear power is a absolute impairment.
In France, we have conducted a security entity that has uncompromissed and transparent controls in already existing works, such as the building in Flamanville.
The work teams that have been made a name due to their professionality are just to be seen by the security idea.
In the middle of 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious cases.
Only one, and although in three miles island, has occurred under normal operational conditions, so he remained without consequences for human and environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama was rebuild by reacting, as well as inevitable, human consequences.
In fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been made up to daily exhausts that caused the death of several thousand people.
The nuclear industry will also remove its teachings from this accident as it had done after the two precedents.
As a result of this procedure, as well as of a cooperation between the French and German operators and the nuclear power operators, the EPR provides a project that allows him to resist such phenomenon.
Since there is a desire to build a nuclear power plant among the electronic technicians, a building up in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, reading free travels to travel the position of the increasing nuclear development.
It is inappropriate and legitimate to seek the best energy building for our country, but it would be unresponsible to allow emotions, dogments and parties to dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is Immigration Last or Chance for the Economy?
The immigration policy carried out by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to one of the numbers under ­, agreement with the status of a "Land of Human Rights", as France himself named.
Recently, the consciousness against foreign students from the recipient had made the weekly views that the Internal Minister had temporarily announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France needed no talents, murer or Kellner from the outerland.
But this was only rarely analysed from the economic viewpoint.
On this subject, there is a large consensus between rights and left.
On the right hand, the sound of Jacques Chirac, which explained that "900,000 workless, including more than 2 million immigrated workers, could not be a problem for a country," on the left side by Michel Rocard, which had shown in 1990, "France cannot take the whole world's poverty."
Single subsequence is in grades of gross movement
The invasion of the national ground by the hordes of the Poland Klempner was divided from right and left in 2005.
Both layers have taken the immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only subsequence is in the degree of the gross movement that is intended to stand against the immigrants.
Francois Holland is limited in the programme to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "Migration Problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the choices, but it is economically costly.
Like the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron, in a recently advertised work that covers the most recent recognition of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shape Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton & Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive influence of the immigrant flow on economic growth, sales and workplaces in the immigrant countries.
Increasing immigration would strengthen growth and threaten work situation.
The protection of the influence of the migrants is based on the idea that those who are attempted to substitute the local workers, especially the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
However, the experience shows that the immigrants in truth are essentially more complimentary than the domestic loan employees, since they exercise hard-to-powered workers in sectors that are unloaded.
The smaller qualities of immigrants are working in sectors that are a little traveling in the home loan workers who work in dynamic sectors where education is not comparable to the job offer.
Positive Loan Effect
Like a Chirurg would have difficulties to work in a country in which a manage of anesthes has, this complementarity also affects the positive effect of immigrant access to payments and national work situations.
Giovanni Peri in this way calculated that a 1% increase in the immigrant flood would lead to a concomitant, long-term increase in real loans between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without prejudice to the fact that the immigrants have introduced the idea and economic growth (increasingly part of immigrants under Nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute netly to the social systems, in the countries in the middle of about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Working Organization estimates that a person who is immigrant to Germany in the age of 30 years brings a net contribution to the public budget in the average of its lifetime (income minus debts) from about 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to add his mandate to the deep-interface points with the teeth.
However, these deafs that should be threatened by the immigrants have achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has discovered the democracy, now we are still thinking about the democracy.
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The continent should be able to note himself who, after his finding in Athen over two thousand years ago, had made the 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, the total ́s, the Holocauste, the Gulag, but also the Francos in Spain, the Salazars in Portugal and the prince in Greece.
Some have believed that it was quick to exercise voting rights, and that in the most direct way they could see democracy along with their enemies.
You know since Napoleon's little boy, that it was a characteristic of spiritual preservation.
The general election right, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can be good to the "expressive instrument", as the Republican philosophy Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires more: a public space, a public spirit, values, a organization, training and control of the powers, training, increasing, economic and social spirit, a legal proclaimment.
The crisis in Europe, where we are, is a economic crisis, but it is a very much and more democratic risk.
In this regard, the memory of the Greek Reporter of Truth-Falsch would have doublely concluded characters: once the need for a powerful return of the One, but on the other hand also those of the disappointing feeling of their incapacity, their inappropriacy.
This ambition should be considered as overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic Battle have been decreased today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are not going to the right direction.
We have nothing to win to achieve the success of the national referendum, which has been organized in dependence on needs and in wrong order.
A free view for the only ruler or a shopping with the eyes connected to the empty nationalist backward: a gross choice for the citizens!
No, we want hackebeal, but a collective task, with full right, clear and permanent, a choice and democracy, this time at a level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there are no more knowledge of where to end the summary - because there is only one crisis, and this rules in Europe.
It is all Europe that uses the market dictate and the rating agencies, which suffers under its incapacity and disability of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humbled at international level.
There is a disturbance on the transfers of sovereignty to Europe - that is the whole Europe that has lost its sovereignty, and that is, in order to make everyone of the Nûss which he has joined.
The difficulty is to return the leadership of the project.
Because it is in all cases that the Europeans reduce the burden of their debt, free from the markets and can enlarge a future by investment.
The outcome of the crisis has decisions at a level of conditions that can not be liked without a total democracy legality, without causing us to be completely securely destroyed.
After this proposal of Jacques Delors and the socialists have been punished a long time, everyone today takes the economic management.
Comprehensive.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - would be a new torture and another sackage.
We need to take a new stage of building on us.
To allow the Republic to become in France, the fact was to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not be sufficient here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must build a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a political view of democratic Europe, a real popularity.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contaktless" chip cards become to general goods
The world center for Chipcards opens their gates on Thursday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic attitude.
In 2011, Eurosmart should end with an increase in 11% of worldwide sales of microprocessorchips (EC cards, SIM card phone) with more than 6 billion units.
The most tranching segment is the uncontakt technology, allowing payments in public resources or purchasing purchases by simply holding the map on a reading device.
In contrast to the previous year, 320 million were to be crossed this year in 460 million uncontakt cards worldwide!
The market share should continue in 2012 (580 million expected units) and more than 10% of the global chip card (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins uncontakt payment on the ground after a long time in the Asia Pacific region is declined.
Some 26 million visa cards have already been equipped with this functionality, and 75.000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the starts are more modesty: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been spread.
However, consumer markets make damps.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2,5 million uncontakt Pass MasterCards this year.
To overcome too closely speed, the banks are now necessary to equippe their customers with these cards.
"Two gross French financial institutions have committed their customers to provide systematic bank cards in the future with uncontakt chip," Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment per phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the future payment means: the mobile phone.
A quickly lower prosecution of devices has been equipped with the NFC technology necessary to implement these transactions (Near Field Communication).
"They're in the middle."
"But at least the next year, they should learn a real development of resistance."
"We calculate in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiatives.
The Crédit Agricole has announced the start of a test run in Caen yesterday, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule allowing uncontakt payment.
The BPCE provides a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société General had said last night to prepare the market introduction of a boat that allows their customers to contact without a phone payment.
Terrorist front understands, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is injured over the relationships between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Sect Boko Haram.
The relationships of the terrorist group Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sect Boko Haram seem to be affected.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vize-Auven minister Messahel himself had approved that Algier had now achieved "science".
"The way both organisations and the relationships of the secret services are to be a clear cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations about the latest January of two franchises in Nigeria have been promoted by day.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Del· shall be killed on the following day at the same time as several of their deputers, where appropriate, one operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators wanted to find several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists in the dreams.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the phone calls leads to several interview partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interview partners: a number leads to a Nigerian who is long-term in Mayduguri, a city in the north Nigeria, who has stopped the wheel of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man that applies as the Aqmi and the Sect.
"This is a progress, but there is no doubt to wait for clearer ideas before you can speak of a operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's still thinkable."
"Man knows since years that the sect is concerned of financial and intellectual support of auvens and that it is very active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo decreases.
In these last months, these "substation services" have become more adequate in their history, as well as the operational modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of always more complex sprung materials that are the same handbook as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community has since this time pressed Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have actually considered the grouping for long time as the Community of illuminates, which should not be given special attention.
Quick success
The Boko Haram founded in Mayduguri in the area of a moschee, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which means in Haoussa so much as "the western education is a shame" - follows the creation of a islamic emirate in the Muslims north of Nigeria.
In this middleless region, the combination is rapidly successful.
She is politicsed and insisted on the strike compliance of the Scharia, while its associated activists are used in the fight against the wicked central government.
Activists have churches, bars and authorities in the visa.
2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their strengthened attacks against the Commissioner.
However, the reaction from Abuja is as usually indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, a number of 800 dead.
The Mohammed Yusuf taken in prison is killed in prison.
Therefore, the sect will seem to be radical and leave its highbourgs in the north.
Last Wednesday she took herself to an attent in Jos, which requested 80 people's lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned to the debt of a self-mortal deputy, which occurred in the safe police office quarter in Abuja - the first of his species.
In August, the local seat of the United States N° was held to the priority of international targets.
The education of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania over Nigeria to Somalia, has been disturbed from all security experts.
Since the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the operating Somaliers from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé has warned and shown himself ready with President Goodluck Jonathan, before Boko Harem,"inform all indications."
The world is established by the Republican presidential candidates
Middle Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are rivalising in Simpli creation and ignorance regarding China, Iraq and Israel's assistance.
Can a Christian American have a complex world with simplicity to not say: a number of ideas?
If you are listening to the Republican presidential candidates, the electors may have almost this impression.
Since a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their constraints have made their demanding statements and their statements regarding the oven policy, the traditional Republican point, repealable.
About China, Iran and Israel's help - often undermined in no way - Slogans.
With regard to the name of the "Grande Old Party" at the highest level in the middle of the course, Romanney, the Chinese were forced to cite the WTO and to cite them the "Work Manipulation" - the subject in a America that the migration of the whole industrial road to Asia is at the first.
It was stupid if this was to imply the introduction of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, an ancient messenger in China under Obama and the only Candidate, who seems to have an exhausted vision of Auven Policy, has almost cut off the air about his emotional mixtures.
He had a handfire, but active talks with Peking (including the current standing of Obamas).
But Huntsman will not be heard because he stands in the depth of the opinions issues.
Reagan's Emblem
Romney had also committed military conflicts against Iran if the sanctions should be eliminated to stop the nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll order Iran's content," he did.
"Obama is selected again, they get the bomb."
In addition, he has proclaimed the strengthened military assistance of Israel and accused Obama to remain responsibility for this partner.
The undertaking Herman Cain, secondly located candidate, brings an accurate knowledge of acts to see.
Recently, he urged to give the Chinese military threat to Contra, since Peking was trying to develop a nuclear power, and it seemed that the fact that China was already in possession of a military atmosphere since 1964!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military fights against Iran, is to be ready to take the military army in Mexico against cards.
The refusal from Obama 2009 was also provided by Cain, Perry, as well as the Michele Bachmann candidate.
You are far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auvenpolitic weight.
The current presidential contractors found that Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all, wined the cold war.
They call in memory that Obama was also an amateur and had to give water in his wine, what was about the subject of anti-terror.
They keep right to the misfortune of his naive interview with Iran, the primary decline of his "Young" from Iraq, his uncleanness in Libya, which also introduced him the call of the weaknesses.
However, this beginning is not so uninvited.
The population also appreciates the positive bi of the national security under Obama, which has disabled Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she is protected from military interventions that lead to praise.
And Obama surprises the appropriate, argumenting that America must be rebuild economically in order to rescue its leading position to a new life.
North Stream, new port to Russian gas in Europe
The Gas District North Stream, which runs on the East Sea and directly connects the Western Europe with Russia, was established in operation.
It must provide gas for a equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasprom wanted this event to be with G.G.A. and Gloria.
More than 500 loaded guests, including four government leaders, have attended the last Thursday on the East Sea Coast under Orchester Equipment and on the Fenish Mecker Buffet of the introduction of the new Gas District North Stream, which has directly connected Russia and Germany under the sea level.
The German Kanzler Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his official Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, together, have turned the tax of the Ventilation, which transports the Russian Gas into west-western network.
With the new gas district, 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gases per year will be delivered by the first roadway of 24 km, which the region of Sankt Petersburg is connected to Mecklenburg-Vorpommers to West Europe.
A second road guide which has a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you have already allowed the possibility of building a rational guide to themselves.
For Gazprom, the time-time and point-out completion of this large building work is a victory.
The project was strongly conflicted in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North-Stream Pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any travel through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the ground.
That is why these two countries lose a little of their power: for them it will now be more weak to exercise pressure on Russia by trying to disturb the access to western markets.
Warschau, which was most involved in the debate, was not allowed to compare the North-Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pacte" in connection with the covenant between Hitler and Stalin, in 1939, to the occupation of Poland.
This means that the theme is politically seen firstly sensitive.
Western Europe has gained more security insurance through the promotion of this Russian project.
However, this is on the costs of a rehabilitation of energy, since the project has caused a break between West and Eastern Europe.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, west-western countries, the strong gas consumption and its gas agreements.
"This gas drive is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in organic ways," was held by François Fillon in the introduction of the gas district, indicating in which grades the gross gas contracts are important also by political and economic side.
All this explains the wide range of gas-prom manager represented in Lubmin.
The building of this gas chain is also a wonderful technology.
The subwater guide consists of a steel with beton numbering which it will be thrown before ships.
It's still on the sea side, in about 200 m depth.
In its building, the second World War had to be developed myn fields dating from the second World War.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or disrupted," Jens Mâer, speaker of the Society Nord Stream, said.
In addition, strengthened mixtures were to be taken for the protection of Fauna and Flora.
The direction is a long shadow of metal, hard like 242 eggs that are over the whole length of nothing: neither by ventilation nor warning.
A control platform was intended before the coast of Switzerland, but the project responsibles have dismissed because the Sweden had little power to see a Russian State society on the level of their costs permanently.
"In the case of a hae we lock the gas media in less than a minute," accurate Jen's Mâmer.
In the case of a lack, the gas that is in the gas dinner drive is so in the air.
This case, however, is considered by the constructors as only a little probably, since the wheels have been estimated to be a consistency of a leck per 1000,000 years.
The State monitoring of the gas travel is guaranteed both by a subwater robot that is entering external observations from a sea chief and by a device circled within the gas district.
It is the form of a cigarette, mixing a meter diameter, is introduced into the interior of the road and continued by the gas pressure.
After three full days of the fort movement through the direction at a speed of 3 metres per second, the device provides the most precise information on any deformation of the metal at its arrival.
The gas drive was conceived to work for fifty years, without to be subjected only to the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bars at the accessibility, 100 bars at the exit site.
Five companies have joined their powers to perform this project.
However, the management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are participated in (15.5%), as well as the Netherlands Gas and the French company group GDF Suez (9%).
These five companies have designed a company named North Stream, which is charged with the building and the operation of the gas district.
She has her seat in train in Switzerland, where the taxation is especially favorable.
Gazprom thus dismissed the entire capacity of its gas transport, even in a prolonged twenty-year-year contract.
"Gazprom will be cut off for the total capacity, not as gross the real transporting gas quantities," exactly Jens Mämer.
The financing of the gas transport facilities was 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
All works should be 7.4 billion euros for both road guides.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment sum was 240 million.
However, the minority actors are required to recover their installations because gasprom is only the risk of detention.
The Gas driving goes to a sandy, managed coast stretch at Lubmin from the East Sea.
The 4,5 metres high ventilation forms the gas output spouts.
Sensors meet pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the incoming gas before it is translated into the German gas guides.
Since Sunday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
In full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a mark note book.
From a Italian company called to life about five years ago, Moleskine now wants to give a new style to write again.
It has a flair of aventure, hours with the writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular entry, → Gummiband, the egg colored pages as older over the time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know today, has occurred in 1997.
The Italian Employment Modo Modo, which has his seat in Milan, has concluded to bring a different design notice book on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's director, has been assigned to the marketing of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an older manufacturing technology called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshaut), which includes a tree wall, for example, used for the movement of poultry bands.
This type of notebook was very asked among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has allowed a old and almost forgotten object to reset up to the 20th century as an icon of predgardist artist," said Maria Sebregondi, now responsibility for marks in Modo Modo.
Success comes.
between 2006 and 2010, the sales increase by 26% and are established by a paragraph of 12.7 million.
This is far away from the usual production of the first years where only 3.000 notebooks were made.
Moleskin has the Italian border and is carried out in 70 countries, even from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phhantom picture of the buyers, since the notebook is also interested in business leaders, as well as students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitical, cultural and manifest customers.
The small, Italian enterprise, which counted at its beginning 12 employees, has been employed today more than 100 employees and workers since 2008 on two offices; one in Milan, another in New York.
The company repairs his bookbooks in booking treatments, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small butics of the city, and understands to carry out its ability.
"We have followed the magazine and new writing needs, despite the exhibition of e-mails," explained Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural character trail is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine Company: The mark has recently launched an exposure called "Detour (Omway) " in the architects and artists of their own notebooks.
In August, the company, on the basis of the film festival in Locarno, also held a link with Leoparden patterns on the market.
Moleskine benefited from success and this culturel magazine and understanded its products to differentiate: rocks, date calendars, F facies, computers... The mark shows the entire band width of articles.
A success that brings down the plan: In Herbst 2006, Modo was made by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, who has been shopping today the Syntegra Capital, and thus set up a new chapter in the story of the Moleskine Company.
Why is the rate of labourless workers remaining in such a high level?
Inapproximately 19% of the deteriorated persons are searching for a workplace.
Today the "15th week of work for residents".
Despite a target-conscient public policy introduced in 2005, the rate of unemployment is continually doubled in defected persons as the average average value: 19% represented 9% of the total population's unemployment.
Disgusting?
"No, so it emphasizes E日 Blanchet, Director-General of the Association, which is adjusting the "Week of the work for employees".
"The progress achieved within five hundreds of years is significant."
"They wasn't the duplicate rate of worklessness, but three times so high."
"Nothing is still very much to do."
However, it must be said that there is still a number of obstacles for lost workers before they get a job.
Increasingly, the elderly are: 37% are older than 50 years (17% in the average).
They have a small level of qualification: 80% of them do not have abitation and there are only 100,000 employees under the 2,3 million students with a complete educational conclusion.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the prejudice to 38% in total.
Shortly, there are so many criteria that cause a renewable work income and which make the "the kern of the problem", as Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a constitution based on 1992, which is helpful to buy job employees.
So much to the real bremses.
Remember the unforgettable, the spiritual attitudes that have been able to develop, but quietly develop.
In April, an IMS entity for the La Cité magazine reported that the requested Manager has "a weak level of knowledge about barriers", which "represented" is "of persons in rolls, psychical or intellectual minor agents".
The result is that the enterprises with more than 20 employees have a very strong way to achieve the 6% of the employees' employment objective, which is set out in a law of 1987.
The numbers from 2008 refer to a 2.6% qualified.
"We are now at the 3%," reports Pierre Bla日, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization that has been assigned to introduce contributions from enterprises that have dismissed this law.
The evidence: The number of paying taxes has decreased the amount of payable amounts between 2007 and 2011, although 59.000 to 46.000 (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Law of 2005, which provides increases in contributions, made a strong pressure on the enterprises," explained Pierre Bla.
"But this improvement also brings real knowledge, especially in the gross company groups."
According to the Ministry of Work, only 59% of the workshops between 20 and 49 employees are interrupted with 100 to 199 employees, however, 82%.
Hazard: "What for a happiness"
Just before they bought the "Blue Service Days (20:45 hours), Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had no pleasure for them to enjoy the friendship game.
It would be too far to say it had given a secret understanding between them, but the image is symbolic bands.
Side on page on the survey podium of the city de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to make peace well and pleased.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attack player against Turkey, the Belgian National Tra's had no pleasure in respect of his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, progress and the fact that he is more."
"I want to look forward," assured the nice liller on his side.
What is the contrast between his presentation in the club and the national's own"It is a unit that justifys everything."
"In Lille I'm over the whole year, which isn't the case."
"It's time for me to go to the beginning."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, adding Friday against Romania in relation to the match against France to finally "blanch".
However, without submitting the note of "freeness".
Since the age of 7 years, the French nationality has celebrated its severe field movements between 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supported," he's acting.
This helps to strengthen the "single" character of this meeting even more.
So much in the preceding: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he relates.
"We're just running through the way."
"Get them to play means great happiness!"
Likeness reads on his side with kindness "Stop".
"The Stolz, a galama" to go out.
"Stolz" also refers to - in his property as "neighbors" - that France" or a man has become a very high level, and that is a little more than one year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Bla's doing a damn job," he was amazing.
Although the next European Mastership will be defeated, the technician is very nice to share the aircraft with the blue (the French national eleven) ... and the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We're younger ones come out grove," he pointed out.
"We're going to plan a thing that players are ambitioned, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the previous games." The game against France will be involved.
Portugal very confidential
The Portuguese community of Paulo Bento, with a gross optimism, sees the return game against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
At the end, two communities had chosen the sequence.
"In the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy community and especially a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no smallest influence of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national election for which he is responsible since September 2010, will be more qualified for the European Mastership 2012.
For Portugal, this is in fact only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to deserve an enemy, even Bosnia.
In view of the hint (0-0) on Friday in the Hague of Zenica, it seems obvious that the wheels have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party clearly over more than one hour, but the community was not able to press the matter as important that would have taken the pressure from her.
"This is a result which, however, provides a certain risk because we haven't achieved a external court."
However, the Portuguese are convinced that in their light streaming town de la Luz in Lisbon, in the case of a public that should also be on the game, even if the party has been announced as "very nice", the optimist, but transparent Bento said.
"We expect a very little match, but we are perfectly convinced that they can win the top," explained the 42-year Portuguese Tra ·.
"We continue to be a 50% new chance in the European Mastership 2012," but the follower of Carlos Queiroz related.
On Friday, in Bosnia, the Portuguese forces to gain and win a gate.
A divorce may already suffice to the Bosnians who also need a gate.
"This is a result which, however, provides a certain risk because we haven't achieved a external court," Bento's duration.
"We're going to attack a community, which has high technical quality and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese had already used to exercise a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think" at the beginning.
A idea, under the condition that it will be implemented this time in reality.
