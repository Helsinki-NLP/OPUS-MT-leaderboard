I spent three hours, fixing the car.
Is Russia part of Europe or Asia?
I've been home all day instead of going to work.
I've been home last night to wait for your phone.
Is this a house?
Is that all you brought?
Is that for an important reason?
Is this black bag yours?
Is that French?
Is this a rail station?
At the place or on the outcome?
Is that true?
Is this your car?
Is yellow?
Is there somewhere McDonald's here?
Is there a English-Japanese dictionary on the middle?
Is there any other input?

What's new?
Is there something that Tom can't?
Should we have something to pre-speak?
Is there a pattern?
Is there a zoo in this park?
Is life before death?
Is there water on Marsie?
Is this your book?
Is that what you wanted?
Is that your guy?
I can't say that it really happened.
I can't do it in the middle.
I can't say you're married.
I can't understand how this happened.
I can't do Tom yet.
I like this rower.
I still think Tom's gonna help us.
Is her birthday today?
Is your birthday today?
Tom is a genius?
Is Tom a prisoner?

Does Tom die?
Is Tom on the ship?
Is Tom ready?
Tom really goes alone to Boston?
Is Tom still here?

I'm getting up.
I'm at the university.
I'm learning matematics as strong as English.
I've done the first approach.
I've done it.
Soon I wanted to eat a cockpit, a cockpit cut.
I'm going to propose a meeting.
I suggest we're waiting for another hour.
I'm supporting that idea.
They're that you love her.
He wants me to drink.
I'm supposed that Tom was on the test.
Is your mother home?
Is your computer okay?
Is your sister here?
Is your grandmother still a coach?
As it's a year, I'm always buying this morning.
I've been talking to her by the phone.
That's all happened so quickly that I can't explain it.
It started very innocent.
Everything started that day.
It started from sleep.
That's what happened.
Good knowledge of someone always requires time.
The Italians are in Europe.
That surprised me.
I'm so happy.
It can be done on one day.
This can't be three-man in the secret in the infinite.
I bought it for $10.
It costed me to buy a cash.
It might be a cancer.
Maybe it's true.
That could be a good thing.
That depends on you.
It wasn't permanent.
That didn't mean.
It doesn't always work.
It doesn't matter with you.
That's not about you.
It doesn't matter where it comes.
It doesn't look so bad.
It doesn't work like that.
That looks on Sunday.
I felt very good.
Thanks to all women who are to build more humanitarian and friendly cohesion every day.
I made him a favor for my book.
I made him a good gift.
Thank you for getting in.
This happened in May first.
He's got a big water wire and a strong rain.
It's stopped to fall.
I think the spaces exist.
I think Boston is the most beautiful city in the world.
I think he's eating about 10 bullets.
I don't think he doesn't tell us anything.
I think it's a competent person.
I think he's with it.
I think I could do that.
I think I did well.
I think I'll put this red sweet.
I think I lost the keys.
I think I can know what it's about.
I think I'm able to get out of it.
I guess I've got a problem with my boyfriend.
I think it's that it's gonna achieve success as a song.
I think this happened last night.
I consider the food of people as morally persecuted.
I think it could work.
I think you need to see him.
I think that's the idea, and we should do what Tom's proposal.
It's not likely to get any help from the government.
I don't think it'll be so difficult.
I think it's time to buy a new camera.
It's not likely that any party sells this model for such a price.
I don't think it's probably possible that such a situation may be repeated.
I think the new Windows version will certainly not come out this month.
I think it's a little likely to get Tom to the party alone.
I think it's true.
I think it's true.
I don't think it's gonna fall this afternoon.
I think it would be too difficult to do this.
I think I've met you already.
I think I did well.
I think I found something of yours.
I think I'll stay home.
I think the lock in Malbork is great.
I think Mary's a own woman for me.
I think my German is really fucking fucking.
I think it's a woman's crazy.
I think everyone should learn some stranger language.
It is that learning trigonometric is unsensitive for many people.

I think Sami's a sick person.
I think she's from Germany.
I think something's worried about her.
I don't think Tom's taking drugs.
I think Tom doesn't sing too good.
I think we bought everything we need.
I think it's gonna be all this today.
I think that would help.
I think you're right.
I think the best way to learn English is to stay in the United States.
I mean, so I am.
I think there's still a hope for you.
I think it's the best Chinese restaurant in Boston.
I think it's yours.
I think it's a long time for three years.
I think Tom's different.
I think Tom's kidnapped.
Tom probably suggests that we should go out.
I think Tom went to Boston's car.
I think it's gonna be bad.
I think Tom doesn't seem to be tested to the right of the driving.
I think Tom would have been a teacher with me.
I think we could be friends.
I think let's start with a new one.
I think we'll get Tom.
I think we'll get there before twelve.
I think we should do that.
I think what you say is the truth.
You'd like it there.
I think you'd be different with the ship.
I think you'd do it.
I think you'll be happy.
I think you're right.
I don't think you should go.
I think you've been too long in Boston.
I think you were in a mistake.
I don't think you were right.
I thought they'd always be alone.
I thought I knew what to do.
I thought I could find you here.
I thought I should have offered Tom help.
I thought I'd break the car.
I thought he was refusing me.
I thought that guy had a gun, so I shot him.
I thought Tom would be here.
From the beginning, I thought we'd be friends.
I thought it worked.
I thought you were living in Boston.
I understood that could happen.
I thought it was a ass, and it was a bird.
I thought Tom and Mary would kill.
I thought Tom was guilty of what happened.
I thought Tom was going to know about the same thing.
I thought we had eating all that was in the house, but I found another crakers package.
I thought you'd be alone.
I thought you'd be more helpful.
I thought you were gone.
I thought you knew them.
I thought you were talking hard.
It's so crazy.
There's nothing to convince them.
That's the idea of playing a shog after dinner.
It's a longer room, not a little bit.
There's tenth.
There's 11 years.
That's the case of life and death.
It is amazing that the Iraqians, whom the Arabians was in the way of the country, became the worst of his confessions - were moved to persecute Zoroastryism witnesses, although it was the religion of their fathers. Something like the Stockholm syndrome in the scale of the people.
That's contrary to the judgment.
Foreigners are not easy to learn Japanese.
It's hard to understand.
It's hard for me, but it's not impossible.
It's hard to talk to someone who only says "Yes" and "No".
It's hard to find out who the vehicle is greater.
It's stupid to read that magazine.
It's not going to do things through the window.
It makes it lighter on the top.
That works on my nerves.
Nice to see you.
This plan is difficult to implement.
It's hard to break you up.
It's Monday today.
Nice to see you again.
It's not easy to get bad habits.
I don't care about it.
She often forgets the parasol.
It doesn't mean to talk to him, he never listens.
There's nothing that's trying to convince him.
It doesn't mean to solve this puzzle.
Don't stop me, it doesn't.
It's not always easy to distinguish a good book from bad.
It's not just a price.
It's totally natural that he's proud of his son.
Possible.
Snow falls.
I'm sure he's not coming yet.
It's their only choice.
It's for drugs.
It's too warm for me.
It's true he's a young man, but he's a lot of sense.
It's true, he's a good game in the golf.
It's true he's a young man, but it's a bist.
It's very hard to talk about what happened.
It's warm.
A wind day, isn't it?
It's pretty.
It just doesn't mean anymore.
It's a start.
That costs 100,000 jeans.
That's gonna happen soon.
It's gonna be the third hour soon.
Soon he's going to fall.
It's gonna start falling right now.
It's on the rain.
It looks like nobody's in the house.
She looks like she's got a lot of friends.
Looks like you've lost these data on the computer now.
It looks like Tom lost his mouse out of his bag.
It looks like Tom's happy.
It looks like Tom wasn't right.
It's good to match your beaches.
It looks perfectly.
Now three are buying it.
Maybe that's true.
Maybe it's for you, but how dangerous it is for me.
It might seem to be disappointable, but you'll be satisfied by saldo.
It might seem to be a significant sum, but it's a good-leaving money.
This may take over a hour.
Maybe it's falling south.
It must be very difficult for her to drive home after divorce.
I've got the head that he stole the dictionary.
I told her everything.
I told her that she wouldn't go.
I told him about my ideas, but he took them away from the place.
I told Mary that I want to be just friends.
I told Tom I'd help.
I told Tom that I understand his concern.
I told Tom I'd help him.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to stay in his room.
I told Tom what Mary told me.
I told you I don't want it.
I told you I don't know how to do that.
I told you that it was too early.
I told you I'd do that.
I said you'd never come here anymore.
I told you that you wouldn't play a phoneman tonight, but you didn't listen, and now the neighbor is ill.
I told you that it'd be interesting.
I told you that Tom was late.
I've been doing this.
When we passed through, I took the younger sister for my hand.
I like sweet ones too.
I threw Tom's pill.
He's paying to be aware.
It's fallen all night.
It's fallen along the whole day.
They're going to fall a lot here.
I've done the line as well as I knew.
I tried to call Tom.
I tried to make a job home, but I didn't know how, so I refused.
I tried to clear her memory.
I tried to flee.
I tried to find Tom.
I was trying to inspire Tom to help Mary.
I was trying to hide my disappointment.
I tried to use most of my chances.
I've been trying to imagine that everything was one of me.
I tried to save her.
I tried to be quiet.
I tried to warn Tom.
I've got a stone, and I've cut a stone.
I've got it.
I trust my friends.
He's trying.
There's a square after the eighth.
It's a little strange for me.
That's sure.
It's a complete bathroom, and it's working for me to be nervous.
It's a scary sword.
It's a dream that became reality.
That's a hazard.
It's a risk.
That's a great day.
That's a great beginning.
It's starting greatly.
It's too late for it, don't you think?
Everything's gonna be fine.
It's a half to twelve.
It's started to fall.
It was always like that.
It's always difficult to start writing a letter.
It's a mistake.
It's a easy winning.
It's a crazy case.
There's no thing that wouldn't be good.
This is important for him.
Damn it.
It's damn that you can't buy miracles, as it's buying lands.
It's a letter, I'm sorry.
It was a bad week.
It was a working day.
It was a working morning.
It was a painful day.
I'm glad to talk to you, but I really have to go.
It's better to give than to read.
That's business.
The sky is dark.
It's humble today.
It's cold today.
The predictation of his reaction is fully impossible.
It's totally irrational.
It's hard to talk to him.
The rich is easier to get rich.
It's easily covered with a knife.
It looked like he was sick.
It looks like you'll be hard to see him.
I guess I'm gonna break a night tonight.
It seems fair.
His secretary seems to know the truth.
It seems that this diament is true.
It looks like the whole world's running to the right.
He's gonna get a punish for the late sword.
I think she's very selfish.
Now it's eight hours tomorrow.
That's enough for days.
For everyone, it's real that he's loved.
There's 50 miles to Paris.
It's for a friend.
It's prohibited.
It's funny to read my old man.
It's dark.
It's gonna be late.
It's going to get out of control.
That's gonna have to wait.
It's gonna take three hours.
Now it's appropriate; not too hard or too easy.
It's been better.
It's great that we met.
It's hard to do this.
It's just a little bit to eat.
It's hard to say what Tom wants to do.
It's very little likely that our taxes will fall down.
It's a little likely to reduce our taxes.
Let's take the time for you to go to the frisher.
Parking here is prohibited.
It's impossible that he forgot our meeting.
That's unlikely.
It's unclean.
It's just a little bit.
It's just a coat.
It's just a funny.
That's me, O open the door.
It's my first time.
It's my parasol.
She should go there personally.
Good to be back.
Nice to see you again.
That's not a problem anymore.
It's not a problem anymore.
It's not easy to stick.
Speaking in English is not easy.
That's not gonna be funny.
It won't fall snow today.
There's no reason for anxiety.
It is not for the immoral writer to speak lies; in fact, more lies, better lies, more people and critics will praise you.
It's not important.
It's not just about money here.
It's not my fault!
That's not sensible.
It's not that I don't like to enjoy, I just don't have time.
It's not what I don't want to go. It's just not for me for a moment.
It's not that I don't want to help you.
It's not the first time he knows that.
Not time to go home yet.
They're important, not words.
That's not what she loves you, she loves me.
It doesn't mean to blame one another. We have to find a solution.
It's real that he's lying.
It's real that you're lying.
That's sure.
It's good to get out of time.
It's just going in the television.
That sounds pretty simple.
Almost throughout the world, you can learn English with your family.
It's seventy-five.
It's really terrible.
It's red.
That's a valuable attention.
That's noz.
That's more safe.
Like the sight of the sight, you drink everywhere.
It's Sabbath today.
Snow fall in Paris
Now on snow.
It's started again.
He started falling snow.

It's starting to cover.
It starts dark.
It's starting to dark.
It's starting to spread.
It's started to run.
It's started with a bathroom.
That's the last one.
Time to start from new.
Time to start.
It's time to get up.
Time to start again.
Time to start from new.
That's too far.
That's too big.
Now it's too late.
It's too loud.
Soon it started to fall.
It's not so wise.
There is no doubt that our company would have reached the profits this year.
I'm sure that this movie's got a lot.
I think you're never able to convince him that it's not right.
It's up.
It is very easy to sound naturally in your fatherly language and very easy to sound unnaturally in the foreign.
In a wareous situation, it is important to maintain cold blood.
It's nice for you to help me.
It's very likely to be chosen.
It's not likely to be the same man you've known 10 years ago.
It's a little likely you'd see the horse here.
It's very little likely.
It's damn to leave the gront without the correction.
It's a middle today.
It's like it should be.
It's your birthdays today, isn't it?
Your move.
You need two to dance.
Almost three hours, Tom's got home.
The work of the house has taken Tom a few hours.
I've been red.
It was a beautiful yearday.
It was a fucking crazy.
The work with you was a honour for me.
It was a crazy heart story.
The day was warm.
That was the right question.
That was a moved view.
It was a $100 account.
It was a student banknote.
It was a clean pleasure with you.
That was a sensible interest.
That was a strange learning.
It was disappointing.
That's where we had a meeting on Friday.
It's very unresponsible that he breaks the promise.
That was magic.
That's Mr. White gave Joe this ticket.
There wasn't anything to cry.
It wasn't a long time before he came.
I just learned about the accident yesterday.
It wasn't about money.
It wasn't funny.
That wasn't the way.
The boy wasn't able to cross the river.
It wasn't so hard.
This wasn't here before.
It wasn't that where Tom said he'd be.
It was just a dream.
It was just a coachmar.
That was an inofficial appreciation.
With a big effort, I've stopped laughing.
Chris used to have such a painful behavior.
It was rather easier for them.
It started to fall.
It was the only category that matched.
It was totally my fault.
It's been great.
It's going to start snow soon.
He'll be ready for sixth night.
He's getting quick.
Everything will come back to the level before the crisis.
It's not gonna take more than three minutes.
He's gonna stop falling soon.
It's not easy to do.
It won't hurt.
