The President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed the law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for the duration and payment of goods (—, services) in the purchase of public and municipal needs.
This law is required to resolve the issue of the non-compliance of their commitments to the prosecutors in public and municipal purchases.
Two years ago, the situation that undertakings could not be paid for the already implemented State and Municipal contracts was total.
The President of Russia, then, ordered by the General Prosecutor RF to take a problem for control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not handle non-conscious contracting officers who concluded that they were not supported by contracting, they tried to avoid payment obligations and include illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systematic throughout the country.
Since 2015, for the protection of the rights of the undertakers to receive public procurement payments in 9.7 thousand representations, 75 materials have been issued, and 46 of them have been voted.
As a result, over 66 billion rubbles were deducted to the undertakers.
Instead, these great amounts have not been decreased by the non-payment of billions of contracts.
Basewords have brought numerous, systematic delays for the payment of services to the undertakers where shorter amounts were made.
That's a natural case.
The RW has wined a concurrence for transport services for a number of million rubbers.
The man inserted all its resources, completely fulfilled the commitment, but the money imposed not received for a period.
Results are an increased financial commit of payments, taxes, credits, which would lead to bankroot if the company would not be in charge of the procurement.
The problem has now been maximised in several regions.
However, at the first half of 2017, the total amount of State and Municipal contracts detected by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation members, with about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to achieve critical significances, the procurement works in the manner of manual anticrisis management.
The general prosecutor is personally conducting meetings with representatives of the Authority, in which all secret prosecutors of distortions and measures are intended to be understood immediately.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Jaroslavla and Ecaterinburg.
In order to improve the discipline of public liabilities, the provision of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ " About amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Rights in the establishment of the administrative responsibility of officers for the duration and payment of goods (→, services) in order to ensure public and municipal needs," which was signed by the President of Russia last week.
The Law project was repeated by the Mineconomist Development of Russia on the Initiative of Gender Procurature.
The new Law will comply with the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative laws of the article, which provides travel from 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubbers for the derogation of the officer's duty and payment of goods, and services for public and municipal purchases.
And if the officer had already been punished by the administrative penalty for the similar offence, he was discussed for a period of one year to two years.
All staff officers of the Russian Federation have already received the order to ensure the application of these laws of the Novells on the matter.
The Civil Rights Protection Group has announced a warning on the preliminary in Missouri
The national association of the progress of the color population was warning for the people who travel to Missouri because of the state's discrimination policy and racism attacks.
The Group states: “Preparation for the traveling national association of the progress of the color population, actually until 28 August 2017, calls for African travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly unexpected and to show a greater care in state traveling with a number of doubtful events on the racist area, which recently occurs in the entire territory of the state and those brought here.”
According to the National Association of the Progress of the Colour People, the warning on the predictment of the group has been encouraged by the Law recently adopted in Missouri, for which people have become more difficult to win the needs of discrimination and that they are right-guarded by the State bodies often choose their objects of minorities.
"You have the rights of human rights.
They remain on the roads because of the skin's colors, kill them and kill them,” said the newspaper Cans-City Star, Rod Chapel, the President of the National Association of the Progress of Missouri's color population.
"We are often listening to complaints as never before."
This is the first warning that the United States organization has been announced.
The group was sent to incidents such as the reduction of black students on the racial character at Missouri University and death of the twenty-five-year Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances this year before, after he had completed the benzine during the state-leaving, and Missouri's police arrested him without providing an accusation of crime.
The warning also refers to the recent report of the Secretary-General of Missouri, which is the possibility of stoping on the road for black drivers for 75 per cent above than for white.
"The purpose of warning is that people are in the course of the situation and warn their families and friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people should be prepared or not or not, if they will take money for the debt or notify the relatives who travel in the country's territory."
According to the latest data programme of the FBI reporting crimes in the land of hatred, 100 crimes were registered in Missouri for 2015, which makes the State sixteenth in the State for the number of such crimes.
Warning is also a response to the new law of the Missouri state, which will be more difficult to make an action against the law of the EEC in relation to residence or work discrimination.
The previous American Union announced warnings for traveling in Texas and Arizona after these States adopted new immigration control laws, which would have been prescribed by the right-guarding authorities to arrest people for the violation of immigration laws that, according to the opinion, should increase the number of racial checks.
Previsible warnings are usually issued by the State Department applicable to other countries, but public organizations have recently reached in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Two people died as a result of the shot on the police patrol in Egypt
The non-shirt police patrol in the City of Isna, reported Re日s to the Ministry of Inner Affairs of Egypt.
During the shoot of two people, including one policeman, three were killed.
All the wounds have been delivered to the hospital.
According to that agency, the police stopped the car and then two armed persons opened up by fireguarders.
One of the wrong-doers was arrested, the second could be hidden.
Rosturism supports the law on the cancellation of free baggage for non-reverse aircrafts
The Chapter of Rosturism Oleg Safonov stated at the DCR television interview that "only" would be to adopt the Law on the cancellation of the free baggage in non-reverse aircrafts.
"We need to create the conditions in which a person who has no baggage can buy a debt billet except the baggage," he subscribed.
In this case, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concern of the citizens, it would not be possible for the transport of clothes and phones in the hand.
"It would be right to peace all our citizens and tourists and to say that it would be to the clothes, to the zone, to the phone, to the hipe or even to any computer that would not have," said Rosturism chapter.
The former President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed the law that provides the right of the aircraft to exclude the rule on the free baggage on the non-reverse aircraft.
It also states that aircraft companies can identify the amount and the weight of the baggage included in the non-reverse tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the threats of Baikal
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin on the Baikal Protection Meeting reported that in the past years the Lake Territory has been extremely threatened.
He ordered to determine the sources, plans and artists to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also commanded to carry out a full-valuable recultation of polluted territory.
"We must also discuss the objects that continue to work here, the cleaning of most of them," quotes the President's RIA News.
He also added that the General Procurement of Russia should carry out a test on the detection of environmental activities.
According to his statement, there are problems in the sea area with the emergency of natural weapons and the environmental disturbances from the relief operators.
"I want to underline this: not all the way to check, but also the measure must be known here, but it is the illegal and environmental activity and the appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, Genprocuration reported the reduction of fish stocks in the Baykal Lake and proposed to increase the number of objects under the environmental supervision.
On 15 June, Vladimir Putin stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens in the natural territories of the protection regime.
He was informed of the issues of the management of the households of the island of Olhon, which is in the Baikal Natural Territory.
The Chapter of Min Nature of Sergei Don's speech proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the limits of the water protection area of the Baykal, but in Buratia, the Government claimed that such amendments were not sufficient, since there were a number of regulatory acts.
Previously, in Mineconomics, the problem was resolved by amending the Agricultural Code and Environment Protection Law.

Disneyland with the punishment.
Why is the law in Singapore fulfillment?
I'm talking to the Chang Businessman, sitting at the open air.
In commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang breathes one cigarette for the other, and the boxes are accurately stored in the board of railboards.
After negotiation, businessman is directed to the nearest urne, a hundred meters to it, and he's going out there.
Structure for the muor in the public is $500, reported by Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflex to you: to put the confections on the boss, now it's tragic.
Now it's all the videocamera.
And indeed, Singapore's trotuary in the center of the city are clean, like in the museum.
Chang says, three months ago, his 18-year-old son has drawn up the wall of the old term.
The Court recognised the guy in the vandalism and sentenced to the park.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He got ten shots of wooden bottles on the bastards and spent a week in a week.
We have no physical punishment of rareness.
As the highest level of life in Singapore and increasingly serious laws, it was understood by the overviews of the AIF.
No one thinks to cancel the punishment here, explains Victor Lee Hong.
And the Government has long been taking into consideration both the Russian and the United States.
If a man carries a large drug party or trades them, he has a high place.
In 2002, in the airport of Changi, a 22-year-old citizen of Australia was arrested: it was about 400 years of cocaine.
In his protection, the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, rights-guardians and even the papa of Rome, had expressed his protection.
However, the boy was still in the outcome.
Following that, the country’s drugs are closely on the side.
The fact is: Singapore believes that laws are required to comply with the ESF, not only with modesty and non-respected people.
It doesn't matter who you are a million, a vice-premier, a artist or a resident.
In this case, one: if you'll find a cocaine pound, you'll be able.
When you go through Singapore and meet tables with dogs of warnings, you're simply giving a miracle -- how many prohibitions in this city!
For example, it is sold only in appeals, and it can be purchased by a doctor.
The tourist doesn't take the wheel, but it's supposed to switch the "green" into the metro, and they'll cut a screen in $1.000.
In four days, I met two guys with white tables on the hair: "I've murdered."
In addition to the trap, the holidays are often talking to the "bounds in the courts": a week to remove the parks and the beaches.
6 billion rubs. The " criminal" who forgot to smile water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a small need in the home lift, a special detector works - the doors are locked and sends a signal to the field.
Including extremely exotic laws, it is prohibited to feed golubs on the street, public fulfilment of songs, and even a excessive floor of rocks (!), it is considered that the waters are attractive to the comers.
In the avoidance of fires to the rubbers, heavy fires in metro, Otherwise 50,000 singapore baxs.
In general, the idea is that, as you try, you're supposed to disturb something.
It's not all right - it's trying to convince me to Mohammed Caber Cadgary, the owner of the tourist.
Especially the statistical laws are only on the bulletin, and in the last twenty years I have not seen that somebody will be attracted.
Why are they safe?
That the citizens don't make it fashioned.
The basic rules are incompatible.
Let us say, if non-completely sales of cigarettes in the kioslave, they will be punished by the box: the master will pay a great amount, the shipmaker himself will get the bullets on the back, and the seller will also wipe out and sit in the ship.
Exactly thanks to such serious laws of violation in Singapore, it is very rare.
Is that right?
In the seventy years, we have had a chaos on the roads -- the cars ignored the lightfores, the wheat as they wanted, they were seated drinking for a roule.
After the introduction of crafts for a year, it's all quiet.
Now the driver, drinking a whisky portion, knows that if the police remain, the police will not leave for a deal, they will be able to deal with the valuation of the apartment, and they will send for years.
Many foreigners have a state in South-East Asia with the diversity of the concealer.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disniland with the Cause" - a guest from the United States brought to a fear of the universal riches of the people, "worrying pure airport" and "occultural nature".
As a result, such things are unnatural, they look experimentally, and it should not be in principle.
The first days in Singapore, and you're faithful to put the paper on the treaty, you're capable of getting into the metro with the throat.
But then you're coming to the Small Indian region, and once it's a "break of the model": the bus stays are a plastic station.
"What's it?" You're fucking doing.
That's what the Singapores smile.
Everything's going.
Not for any such crime, but you must know that if they calculate you, you will not be disobeyed, for you have violated the law.
It's enough to make a man normal.
Of course, the authority in Singapore is full of authority.
But you know what?
In the Vietnamese Hochim, I moved the whole east - the moto often extracted from the tourists of Smartphones and cameras.
In Paris's center, there's plenty of painful bombs and demands.
We are not all trying to throw the mosque into the worm.
Singapore, however, thanks to the summary of drafts and ungrateful laws (to the `cause) which is the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You're going to think about it.
This is a natural nature: Remember, and there was no one in Russia who went on the role until they were scraffing.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not a trap but a voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we have to think that people in Russia would also be happy to purify, to lay down the metro of the mushroom and to welcome the arrest of those who spend the lift with the public toilet.
That's the body chastisement, thank you, don't.
In the other laws of Singapore, at least it is worth looking at them.
Nothing holy?
Now the White House of Trumpa has been invited to the Freedom Statute.
The most reliable character of the change of the regime is when it begins to take place with the status.
The Americans understand that is not worse than all the rest of this is the theatre amount of Saddam Hussein's status in Firos in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key idealists of the Government of Trompa, knew without doubt what he had done when he took a symbolic battle over the Freedom Status during the injury with the CNN journalist Jim Assistet on the proposals of the president on the reduction of the migration.
Let's be honest, Miller hasn't tried the same status.
The owners of shipowners and artists from the Freedom Statute would be broken to him if he tried to do so.
But he tried for her meaning, especially for the meaning he had been assigned in 1903, 17 years after the finish of the monument, when Emma Lazarus's verses were added to the piedestal.
"I don't want to enter here deeply in the history, but the State of Freedom is... the symbol of the American freedom that survives the world.
The rest of which you are talking about has been added later and is not part of the original State of Freedom."
Miller said the facts right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This is about the current sound of hurtful words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants but the poorest, "Your mouths, your poor, / your tolls, who are trying to breathe freely, and the unfortunate remissions of your exhausted persons."
"Unfortunate exhibitions" have never been so visible on our screens.
Miller had no literature -- he was able to understand that the Trump is not expected in America.
This is a part of the more wide political and cultural war: this is actually the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who had been able to put her words on the chocolate of status after her death, were very well-approval that they did a perfect political act.
The Sculpture for the purpose had to identify the relationship between the French and the American Republic using the banal class of the woman's freedom figure.
Lazarus changed her sense: in her verse, a woman's figure is no more abstract, she has a voice.
And she had a different name: the mother of the Exiles.
The combination of texture and images was a flaming feminist village and a contrary attack against the American Nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the status, the rights are just to change it back.
Gromogloss Rash Limbo, her kind of John Baptizer, who announced the arrival of Trumpa in 2010, thought that the freedom was not invited, and it was the early neoconservator, the flame of the American darkness in the darkness of the world: "Free and 'forward.
It brings freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The college is not needed to light the way to the United States."
In contrast with Limbo's habits, there was really a point.
The meaning of the status depends exclusively on the angle of the view.
Lazarus’s great creation achievement was to see her as it would have been seen by the exhausted, unfortunate, but full hopes of people on the boats after a long and often heavy floating.
This means literally looking at the world by the eyes of people who seek refugees and chances for a better life.
Its status answers the words of hope and hospitality that they intend to hear.
And, of course, it's not the perifer that Miller and Trump will ever recognize.
Their faculty is not needed to light the way, but to burn hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Championat 2017: Neal Blake highly evaluates the Scotland members of the United Kingdom.
Elide Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scotches in the United Kingdom.
Neil Blake, the Federation Game Director of Easy Athletics of the United Kingdom, stated that a 16-year-old Scotland part of the World Championate would contribute "a significant contribution to the game of the team".
The recurrent number of Scotland airports was listed at the beginning on Friday 2017 of Londres' campaign.
Blake believes that in Scotland "bads something special" and the Federation of the Great Britain's easy athletics should be taken into account.
"We know that and we try to understand and support until they have a potential," said Blake.
"I spoke to people in the Institute of Scotland, and they think it was what they did.
The Scotland Federation of Easy Athletic thinks that they have to work with what they did.
The British Federation of Easy Athletic: they have to work with what they did.
And people in the street think the same.
I don't know why the circumstances were so complicated, but it's totally brilliant."
In Scotland light airports, including Laura Mure and Andrew Bachert, who will contact Sir Mo Farach at 5000 m distant, and Elide Doyle has chosen his capital.
"Alid's humble.
Her captain's words were great," says Blake.
"Several easier athletes, whether Scotland people are or not, and from where they are trained, have come out of this committee, feeling bitterness and consciousness for winning.
The suffering and sincere feelings that Elid put in it were wonderful."
The soldier medal campion of the Community, which at its fifth Championats of the world will escape 400 m with anxiety, says that 16 shots in the British Collection are "increasingly".
The previous record on the number of shots on the world campions was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Before and forward, Laura Muir, specialised to the middle distance and killed five Britannian and two Peopean records last year.
She's going to run 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will participate in 1500 m, is another Scotlandman who should notice: a successful season in which he has been won by the elected meetings of the British College and the Year Conferences.
Doyle recalls his first champion of the world when the only shotman in the team was Le Connell, other than it.
The Captain of the Team says that it is "increasingly fierce" by not just taking into the collection, but in some cases, they will be able to go out for the final.
"The Captain of the Collection is choosing other members of the team, so this was an enormous honour, but to know that your companions have voted for you and you -- it is a perfect thing for me," she added.
"End, I'm very proud of all Scotland people who entered the collection.
This shows how much we got.
And they are all the lowly athletes that will strive to fall on the springs of the beginning.
What's my captain's talking about?
Yeah, I think she was bad.
I just focused on the fact that we were very happy to take the Championat home.
So it's just about how important it is to receive support from the sick and use that we are going to be again at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another opportunity to get out of his aren and to participate in the constructions, and the atmosphere there will be simply noticeful."
Crystal locking on Facebook: don't move to the public position if you are not ready to listen to the criticism from the electors
Asses of our country understood that it was a critical pressure.
The Americans loved George Washington, but they did not want to criticize him for all of the internal policy to its political principles.
His criticism, of course, was disappointed.
But he didn't touch the mouth of his critics.
'Cause in 1783, Washington said, 'You may take the freedom of the word, and we, the deaf and the deaf, will lead as a sheep to the battle.'
Now I'm going to go to the Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Submitted Hogans were locked and struck posts at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official website on Facebook.
And this week the American Union for the protection of civil freedoms gave him a judgment for this week.
Sub-governmental Governors called this request as a noble, and the comments on the Internet were written in the spirit "da and what".
"This is just Facebook," many will say.
But it's also important.
And it's especially important when talking about the type of Hogan guy.
It is a wonderful population of the Governor of the Republic of the Republic in the Democratic Providence of the State.
It is on the second term in the review of approval among 50 Governors of the country.
Hogan isn't a crazy reaction.
He demonstrates a strong hand in the administration of the state and the commitment of his principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary way of connecting to his electors and shows his box on his side after chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary and in the final account that it is not necessary to block people who come to the Governing Board, which is declared as an official public forum and is conducted by the administration of tax payers' money.
At Vashington Post interview, press secretary Amelia Chas protected the Governor's action, claiming that the blocking of comments is just their modernization.
But it's too easily to use the image of trolls, spamers and heaters in the Internet.
"Post" talked to some of the real people whose closure was Hogan.
And it's just real people, not trolls, a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who turns to their chosen leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, contained and not grassed.
Citizing the past, calling for Hogan is a Catholic.
Laxmi Sarma Raman from Bouy, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked for crimes on the ground of hatred.
"I wrote a prominent comment on my disappointment by the lack of his reaction to crimes committed to hate and other news of the last time," she wrote in the section of comments to the article "Post".
"I don't even like the idea that when many people remain in comments to the same subject, some people say that this is a so-called craft, rather than admitting that they have a great group of unfair citizens."
What the sub-governmental Governor calls "contagonized spam attack", others probably would be called "active life position".
In Facebook's time, it is easy to adjust its image, just block critics or remove negative comments.
This is much less than before when it was required to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical previews or arrest and touch the protesting mouth.
But it's just what's going on now, just in the number.
Hogen is not the first factor who criticizes that he doesn't want to listen to Facebook and other societes.
The Chairman of Trumpu has been requested by Twitter users who were involved in its Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this subject was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the United States Environmental Court of Alexandria, James K. Cascheris, the president of the Lawdone Secretary Board has violated the First Recommendation by engaging the electoral in its account in Facecbook.
And in Kentucky the Governor of the Republic of Matt Bavin, the American Union has proposed the protection of civil freedoms for his behavior in Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's time, the available post costs have made sometimes the same turnover as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased in four times, and the authors of anonymous letters had highly distorted its authority.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People under Yuricol, Valerius, Belarius and Percius wrote a letter in the newspapers that smile Washington's decision.
According to the historical documents collected by the " George Washington Documents" on the Internet, his office was invoked by five persons who criticize the position of the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Maritime.
But he didn't try to make them calm.
The freedom of words, other thoughts and expressions is in the same way of our State.
And true leadership means consensus.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for living benefits in the Renessans club
The former campaign of Ronan Rafferty hopes for living benefits in the next three days when the Renessans club in East Lotian will accept twenty-fifth open Scotland tourner for old sportsmen.
The Northern Ireland, whose neighborhood is in the Archerfield Links club, moved in the direction of the final round last year until he lost Paula Ilsa, joined the new and played the role of the representative of the tourner on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sardini club.
"I saw the Rennesans club building, and we watched how it comes to the success of this business," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this field at his best time, it's in a great state.
Jerry's done a great place by building this place.
He's a jealous boyfriend of this game, and he's stumbled with his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field."
Anglican Ils expects the first opportunity to stand a campaign title, despite his 32-year-old career, and in the European Challenge Tour tour.
"This is really a feeling," said the player from Sautport.
"I couldn't try again to win "Extremadura Open" because it was removed from the schedule for a year after I won it.
To return to this angle of the world, it's awesome.
This is a place for golf games.
The memories of the past year returned, and for me and my wife, Sheron, was completely impressive to win in the past year.
It was indeed a special time, and we will always remember it."
It is returned to battle in the land of Gary Or, which was associated with the tourist of the elderly sportsmans after 50 years ago.
This business will be its first occurrence in Scotland with the time of the “Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open” tour in 2013.
"When you play home, it's always more important," said the resident Helensboro Orr.
"You want to speak good, but you feel this additional burden."
I played again with great pleasure, and I showed a bad golf.
I am satisfied with the time it gets."
In the field of this three, the former winner of the Masters tourist Ian Vusnem and the campaigns of Meyers for elderly sportsmen Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark.
Orr and the former captain Rider Cup with Family Torrance are two of the six shots in the field; the rest is Andrew Oldcorn, Steven, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drammond.
Participation in the tour is free, and the parking costs 5 pounds per hour, if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds if a person is two and more.
All incomes are going to the British Cancer Fund.
British roads learn to increase emissions
Manufacturing tunnels on magazines that are able to accelerate the rubber car on the birth of the United States are already tested on the roads of the United Kingdom.
The transport agency of the country, as reported in Autocar, was reported on the local results of 100 meters of the tonnel set on one of the six north of the country.
The tunnel of 6 metres high is built out of some of the newest polymer materials that are able to absorpte ≥ 6 metres of car rental.
However, the creation of the whole network of such tonnels is only a part of the scale measures that British authorities will take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel networks, English people are going to expand the network of ships for electricity, develop a number of activities on the reduction of the car stream on the road, expand the use of commercial transport on electricity weight and modernise the park of hard vehicles.
According to the official statistics, the fourth of all threats of the atmosphere are directly transported, and the uncomfortable quality of air becomes the cause of up to 40,000 preliminary persons per year.
Mosgard has changed the punishment of Mamaeva's invalidity
Mosgard has changed the penalty of Anton Mamaeva's invalence, condemned by four and half of the year of the Holy Year, to 200 billion rubs.
It reports TASS.
The previous prosecution requested the court to replace the term for the conditions, explaining its request by “the illness of Mamaah’s injury” in terms of eligible conditions.
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years of freedom from the penalty of the general crime regime, which was the victim of the former spenaz.
On 19 July, the Court of Justice at the meeting in the SISO released a man from undergoing.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Golden Land
Prepared dinner, Bardina Degey doesn't use it.
She even uses badly rarely.
In his wooden house in Enarotal, the town of Paniya in the province of Papua, the householder usually places a sweet cartridge, which is here called "nota", directly on the side.
A half-hour-to-hour covered club also receives food with insatisfactory hands.
Degei is sitting on the ground, and there is no mobile, and it is here that it performs its home, such as a glass of mut water clothing from the nearby flat.
The wheat serves in the stone without a wheel.
She's the youngest of the four women of her husband, and so she didn't be assigned to work in the field.
A lot of people are distributed here.
Of course, work can be dangerous: many men from this village without drinking, many drinking, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk through the village after five nights," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at the whole life in the high horn of Papua, the former Holland City, which was joined to Indonesia in 1969 after the doubtful referencement, when only 1026 elders stopped to vote, rarely lifting their hands before the occupying armies.
The existing movement of independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned his anger against the Government of Jacarta, which maintains a severe control over the region without allowing for foreign journalists and defenses.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea takes the east part of the island.
Anarotal is a city as far as it is disrupted; the road is a half-time transition from Jayapura, the administrative centre of the province, in Nabire, and then a five-hour road on the rental car.
There is no common transport here.
The city with a population of approximately 19.000 people consists of wooden houses made by bambooes; the cottons of the hofried have been improved in various raw wheels.
Some of the Indonesians have reached here, not talking about journalists, and nearly any of the foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, papuases worshipped a god named Uga Tamé.
There were other changes.
"We were unusually wearing this clothes," Degei said, "in his light, handful, dark yube, and light rubber.
“We used to carry on the body only a sheet.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives in poverty, and levels of employment and gratitude among the worst in Asia.
But it's also an Indonesian golden land.
The world's largest and the most accessible golden round, Grasberg, which belongs to the Freeport McMoran company in Phenix, is located in only sixty-fire of Panay, a high-horn province of about 153.000 people.
Only in 2015, the Freeport company reached gold and medium here for approximately 3.1 million dollars.
Papoa's additive can be decreased by the stocks of the forest which are estimated in 78 billion dollars.
These riches, however, have a disaster for the papaes, guaranteeing that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia are maintaining their amazing presence here.
According to the 2005 review of the new York Times newspaper, the Freeport company payed for military servants and departments of approximately 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150 000 dollars of one officer.
More autonomy needs are threatened by Papuas to make this golden white and unfortunately deteriorate.
In 1969, more than 500 000 papaes were killed by military forces, and thousands were violated, tortured and dismissed.
As a result of the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass murders in the population of the high-ground population of Papua may be considered genocide in the seventy years.
Only last year, the police of Indonesia arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We lose everything”, reported in Brisbane Eparchy in 2016, contains witnesses of the beverages made in the previous year, such as penalties without court, torture, particularly parts, as stated in another report, violence and distress of electricity, and harmful distortion of peace demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because the events are placed every week”, says Andreas Harson, who is investigated in Indonesia for ‘Human Rights Watch’.
The Hajkis were dealt with because the resources of Papua were attached to the cross-border of the other regions of Indonesia.
3.5 million people in the 83% of the province are Christians, but demographic indicators are changed at the time of the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from the Gustonaze Indonesia Islands — Java, Sumatre and Sulvavia.
The Japanese lawyers, “varungi”, sell the yellow bowl and the fruitful “gado-gado” mixed with the arachistic soose.
Local residents are trying to maintain competition.
"The migrants started to sell bowls and fruits in the traditional market than those of Papoa's roots," explains Abet You, the twenty-first-year Paniah's birthday, which moved to Jahapur, the administrative centre of the province, for work.
"For this reason, the roots of Papua are the mother's mother (women) of Papua, who lost their markets."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, of the people like Jackie, had promised to take place in the nearliness and violations of rights in Papua in the course of his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his road to the presidential court in Jacarte, an ex-mademan was invited to support 27 of the 29 Papoa, including Panay.
But there was almost nothing changed in Papua, and the people feel loyal.
“Our hearts have been disrupted because in 2014 we vote for Jackie, expecting him to fulfil our hopes for the restoration of justice,” says Joe.
In fact, only two months after the October Inauguration, Jocky Paniya survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street and sang birthdays at Anarotala, when two Indonesian soldiers were cut off from the darkness.
Fearing children said to them that they should include the ships.
As the pastor of Javid Tebai reported, one of the soldiers was hurt on their tonne and a while returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyes, the soldiers who were drunk were persecuted after their children and were their examples of vine.
Then one of the soldiers shot through a group of children.
One kid, Julianus Amo, who was 16 years old, was so wounded that he had fallen into who.
A few hours later, somebody had a disrupted government from the electoral committee, and the situation was spread on the day of the time.
About thousands of Popus men, women and children were gathered in the football field before the police and military command center to need justice.
They brought with themselves a ritua on the whales and fulfilled the whistle, the dance of the Papua tribe of my pago: they fled around and had a bird's song.
Protestants began to shake stones in the police and military basis.
When the situation was increased, the internal radio-related soldiers were given a suggestion: "If the multitude will be opposition for more than three times, shoot them," so he sounded as stated in the official document that the representatives of the TIME magazine had seen, but which was not included in the CMMs.
Fifty-six years old, Jeremyas Cayama, head of the Cago Coto region in Anarotali, felt the danger of being approached and invited to rest, turning to the people with a request to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I returned, I suddenly fell a powder in my left wheel," he told the Time magazine, standing on the wheel of his bright wounded tree house.
Kayama doesn't know who shoots, but he says that the pool is coming from the side of the shreening assembly of the soldiers.
He adds: "There was a multitude, and there was a lot of shots."
In the inhabitant of Alfius Job three times, as his twice-born brother, who became a witness to the shooting.
“I have reached him and watched his body to make sure that he is” - he said darkly to the TIME Johannes magazine, which, as many Indonesians, only uses one name.
"I saw he was dead... I bought him."
General Yodge Mande, the senior in-police officer of Papua, said to the reporters that his officers were only "defending" their base because it had been attacked.
"We must be protected when people are threatened to kill us," said the police representative of Papoa Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
"This is the question of life and death."
According to the ‘Human Rights Watch’, five young protesters were killed and were much more vulnerable.
The news of murder came to Jacarta only on the day.
At the time of three weeks, Jackie reported a powder in Jayapura, in which he expressed the disease of the victims' families and swore to take the issue of historical misuses in Papua.
"I want this situation to be fixed immediately so that it will never be again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Security Ministry of Viranto said that it would create an injurious body to end historical violations of human rights.
But it's just a moment that we've got the answers.
“The greatest of the distortions has occurred a long time.
There were nineteen or at the beginning of zero.
The fact is that we are sure we want to take these distortions, but they do the procedures that we have to pass," he said.
Then Viranto rejected his words, speaking with the TIME magazine on 5 June in Jacarte, and said that he was not planning to include a body to review the complaint in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be judged."
Viranto, which the United Nations accused of " crimes against Easternness" for more than 1000 people during the blood vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, stated that 11 cases of human rights violation in Papua had already been adjusted, including the incident in Panai.
The seven victims from Panai have met such statements with dark disbelieving.
“In the last three years, I was asked four times but there was no changes,” says Johannes.
"I am wakened."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I am.” He says.
"I fear the wars will arrest me, I fear that they will shoot me."
His brother Jacob also said that the people of Panai are afraid to discuss the event.
He said he was killed by the military after he helped to bury four victims.
“When We buried the body, the warriors followed me.” He said.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Monday, the Indonesian police shot in the neighborhoods of the Dejay neighborhood with Panay.
In the course of a conference between housing inhabitants and the building company manager, who refused to help bring a man who was unconscious, to the hospital, one person and 17 were killed, including children.
A man, a twenty-third-year-old Ravianus Douv, who was hiding in the fish in the near-by-sea, died on the way to the hospital.
The wrathed villages protested before the construction campaign of the company.
According to the police, the villages were shooting stones in officers who were responsible for warning shoes.
But the population claims that the mobile brigade (Indonese speechnaz) started to shoot through the people and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we were afraid of limitation," reported the TIME magazine of the twenty-new-year Domingu Badi, who lives near the hospital, and saw how successfully the wounds were done.
“I had two days in my house.”
The Dejai Parliament needed to call the officers involved in response and the police brigade from the region.
Paniya was always a painful place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development results in the deficiency of the tribes of meat, monkeys, data and ladies that are distributed throughout the territory of the Green in the high-horn areas of Papua.
Many have joined the "Free Papoa Moviment" (OPM) of the Resurrection Army, which claims that it protects the rights of the papa's by providing traditional attacks and attacks with the destruction of people to the Indonesian soldiers.
The OPM's highest runners are from Panai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoia.
As a responsible measure for the last years in Panay, thousands of people have been arrested and unbasedly arrested under the proposal " National independence Protection".
They didn't come back.
among the population of Papua Paniya is considered as a “good, forgotten place”.
Poverty strengthens the deficiency.
The small part of the rice sold in Anarotal is too valuable for the population.
The bread is not available at the same level.
People here produce all that they eat: mainly, notes, as well as some of the phytophics and of the sheet fruits.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can be cared for four-five fields of sweet card.
They usually maintain the majority of families and the other are sold on the market.
Ten of the club notes are only 10 000 Indonesian Rupees (75 cents).
During time, economic inequality has increased between raw papaases and new migrants, which have reached large quantities after the introduction of new airports to the Nabire airport.
Small vacations are usually obtained to more educational and sustainable migrants.
Papuases have rarely enough money or sciences to conduct their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no job or money here," says John Gobai, president of the tribe Council of Panai.
Isolation holds Papua far from the view of the island world.
Furthermore, the SMVs remain increasing.
For this year, French journalists Frank Escuddy and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “insufficient activity with the relevant” despite they had given rare video record authorisations.
According to Fellem China, the director of the Asian Assembly Organization of Human Rights Watch, the promises given in the pre-elected campaign of Jocky were not fulfilled in order to promote transparency and development.
“In this time, foreign journalists who are trying to report report from the East Indian Provinces, Papua and West Papua are with new dangers: rejects in vice and black list,” he said in the statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that the international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly directly by the neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – returned to the United Nations Human Rights Council and requested to investigate “different and broadly spread distortions” in Papua, including the shot in Panay.
The same countries were supported by OPM in the past.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia Arraman Nasir was dismissed from the group's statement, reporting to the journalists in Jacarte that “In Indonesia still acts a democratic system and there is a free pressure, so hiding the episodes of human rights violation would be difficult.”
Local residents want to give attention to the situation to more external governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Netherlands human rights officer, visited Jayaupur on May 4, the residents disturbed silence, please, “We want freedom”, as the source also stated at the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, in 2019, there are new presidential elections, but the papaases say whether they are talking about Jokey again.
"Jokovs are a man who has good works, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shot in Panai," says Gobai, the president of the Council of the tribe.
He wants Jokey to know that the inhabitants of Panay, except that they are in the threats of the Almighty Army, are threatened in poverty, and education and health are in a deceitful state.
Gobai says that the inhabitants of Panay, as well as other papaases, consider their voice dedicated to Jokovi, a long time he must pay.
"They do not need money, they only want righteousness," he says.
Despite threats and threats, the families of shooting victims in Panay have made the last symbolic act of disobeyment: they have protected the body of one of the victims on the ground directly against the police and military party.
As they know that justice is probably never aware, at least they will not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” says Jacob, without taking up the family.
"What else did we do?"
The fire is secondly covered by the Dubai sky 'Fakel '
The fire covered one of the highest heavens in Dubai in the world on Friday, providing hundreds of people to quickly leave the seventy-seventy-years of the height at 337 feet.

Stay reason for mass dragging in the Ural military center
The Elanic School Centre, where a mass drake, has reached a slave group of senior officers of the Central Military Department to investigate the incident conditions.
Some details of this fear have already been made.
According to Mash, on the VContakte page, contractors of the Iranian military party number 31612 were severely disrupted because of a undirected bed.

After transferring to Washington, it has re-repeated blocks or rejected the introduction of the rules against chemical or gas-nephthane industry.
The unexpected exchange of course in the middle is a severe jurisdiction of the currency taken by Puit to return to ancient standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington stated that the EPA Chapter had exceeded its powers by trying to refusing the approval of the Ombudsmanship of the rules required by petrol and gas companies to follow and reduce the flow of metal.
In the midnight statement, Juitt proposed to consider that he simply performed the obligation to cooperate with the States in the completion of the timely fulfillment of new standards.
"Before the previous administrations of EPA, it was often not able to be placed in a time, then he waited for a group of activists and other persons and discussed a period of decision," said the Juit, who gave more decades against EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe that we are regulated by judicial processes, and we will be serious to the time fixed.

But there is an Agency of Space and a desire to develop its own space programme in 2010.
And the establishment of the office of Yuria Gagarina is a given respect for the first person who lived in the space.
On the contrary to the memories of the Council, which are in some countries, Gagarina's memories, in contrast, "shopping on the planet".

Mors Ford's murder: Activists lose Lincha's courts on the scene to call for justice
In 1948, the Ford Mercurie passed along the town of Monroe, in Georgia, and with a raw down to the small Mource Ford Mource.
When the car with four black passengers and white drivers came to the pool, a group of white men with roses rebuild her.
The main man of the middle-years in the coast in the tone of the rubber - went to the cigarette and looked through the wind glass.
Those sitting inside had fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" said a man.
"Bring him out of the car!"
Pronzilles have destroyed the silence when a young black man was thrown out of the front seat.
Happy, this terrible scene that played on July 22 was just an inscenary.
But when Roger's shot was thrown, almost all the spectators and actually breathed up.
Since 2005, the activists return to the Mouse Mors Ford to play again that night when two near-ground couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey were born in 1946.
No one was condemned for these murders.
"It is similar to that no one was arrested for all these years - even though we see them close to us; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brux, who helped organize the opinion.
"This is fifty in our history, and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brux is a former member of the Georgian Conference, who fights all life for human rights.
For him, it is a dramatic call for Monroe's residents and an annual reminder that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want the end, we want health, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice," he says.
"We can't go to health and reconciliation until we enjoy justice."
The Coronel covers the simple body of one of the linch victims at Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBR materials received by An Bi-Sy News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighborhoods were suspicious to participate in lingering.
But there was no accusation to anyone.
Although the decades of suspicion remained free, the right-guardians say that in the town they always knew two motives of springers: policy and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court first allowed black citizens to vote for the preimerez that had to be held in that year.
At the same time, the FBI's reports, the black isolator, Roger Malcolm, struck in the dragon of Barnett Hester, a white farmer, seems likely because of a woman.
Brux says that, by listening to the town, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she had to be born was not from her husband.
According to the FBI reports, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white farmer, paid 600 dollars of charge to deliver Malcolm from the wheel.
He went to the room with Dorothy and their kitchens May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they went out of the rubber and arrived to the Mouse Ford Mouse, the multitude of lingeries surrounded the car.
"The fact that he organized and commanded Harrison murders" is concluded in one of the reports of the FBI.
"It was also obvious that there was a negotiation between the rights of the State and the city which were not only involved in murder, but also undertaken and hided the persons of witnesses."
Brooks calls this step.
"This was an attempt to choose the rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a sign to the black in the city: if you are registered and voted, it will be the same with you."
Nearly ten years of Cassandra Green will rue annually playing that lingering at Mount Mors Ford.
When it is observed, it takes the viewer and relates to the deep racism, which, as many would like to consider, is not more in America.
It's difficult to look and to turn away, but Green thinks that it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about the courts of Linch, because they give us our own nature," she says.
"But I can't build with you if you don't hear me or don't hear what I've survived."
The repetitions of this year began in June, and on the first day of approximately 30 actors, the rest of the black - were gathered in the room and listened to the exam of the pess for years.
Wade Marbo was a register with Green.
He played a role of the main member of the clone for a few years, but he says that the role has not become more.
"I don't think I'm crazy because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
Darryus Bradshow and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins from that Malcolm, who is exposed to that Hester sleeps with his wife Dorothy, crying out to him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
It's called Rascone to answer.
It's getting hit.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are discovered by ho.
Green's laughing more.
"What is it?" Ask Ascon.
He's calm and calm.
I'm playing?
"No," said Green through the smile.
"I just don't think the whites said 'nigga'."
"Yes," is one of the black artists.
"You must take a strong r."
Also, energy is changed in the rock: discomfort changes the feelings of society.
Everyone needs to do everything right, not only for the beach, but also for the memory of four killed persons.
The scene begins sleeping.
This time, when Rascona speaks the word in the letter "n", it gets clear and strict.
No man's laughing.
Spectale ends violently and quickly.
Crycky, shoots, and then silence.
A woman in a traury black clothes stands over the body of the actors and fills the big song Billy Holiday "Strang Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In hundreds of yards, half of the sights are cut off from the eyes of the lake and the powder.
A number of black and white are almost equal to the stars.
One couple came from the New York state to see the presentation; many will be close.
They were all almost eight hours of suffering by Georgia's hard spirit while Brooks led them to the garden of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Before this time, the murder was only a story, but now when they stand on the same place where people were kissing, they were living in the air.
When the song's note is quiet, Green invites people to come closer and look at the body.
Children go up to their places, get to the flower, from blood, and to the insufficient body, and shoot something one another.
"They're not actually dead," a little boy's murmuring, like to talk about itself.
Green thanks to the stars for a few minutes, and then it's over.
Actors pack the hair's hair and cut the lakes out.
Bradshaw takes Marbo, a man in a costum, who played a main cocktail.
Nick Rascona takes two other actors and then weeps, and they fall in their range: the emotional burden of the end was disturbed on it.
"All right," is one of the women.
"We know your heart is good.
You had reasons for this."
Later, the stars are sitting for dinner with the actors.
After one board, the white couple of Atlantic is living to discuss with a black couple with which they just met.
Denise Daplinski hardly looks for words to describe what she feels after the axis.
"It is hard to listen to these terrible, bitter words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"Therefore, I think that the kidneys are going to happen," she adds, "only now it is called that the police shoots."
In the second angle of the horn, Tiron Brooks had a general attention, who remembered his rightsman after eating.
He says that it has already been planning the presentation of the year.
"The water-feeding builds us, because it does not only describe the fear of what we have survived but also teach us," he says.
"Because if you don't get out of this lesson, that can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who don't know their history, are responsible for her repeating."

New test results for the age of refugee requests in Sweden
The latest results of the refugee tests in Sweden, which have undertaken the new medical method of age, have been assessed that more than 80 per cent of protested were estimated as age of 18, but not all believe the exactity of these results.
The Swedish National Medical Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started to test the previous year.
They were determined to make an age more accurate in the delivery of refugees after the Swedish Migrationsverket (Migrationsverket) criticised that it was not able to determine the actual age of some refugees, it stated that they were uncomplete.
The Migrationsverket has now sent 6 880 cases to test, and the Court Medical Agency has now repeated the results of 2 481 tests for the period between March and 31 July 2017.
Eighteen per cent of the tested (2002) were considered as 18 or older people, and in addition 25 cases, the judicial medical agency expressed that the tested “only person 18 or older” was tested.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was stated that the person “possiblely less than 18”.
The tests are carried out only in cases of age.
According to Johann Garance of the Court Medical Agency, the results are corresponding to the results in the past months.
“We have not observed a large difference with statistics in the past months, the numbers of corresponding”, he said to the "The Local" portfolio.
The higher part of the cases in which people were estimated as 18 years of age is not obliged to indicate that the refugee requesters were lying according to the conduct of their age.
My Agency repeated the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “age of 18 or more years tested”.
However, considering 581 reported results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet discovered that in 243 cases, a person openly stated that 18 was fulfilled in this year.
The method of conducting a medical age that is to make the depths of wiseness and toography and to give them to datasts and retinologs, has also been criticized in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinolog of the Caroline Institute of Claude Markus, whose part of his work is a biolog of adults to determine whether they have passed through sexual growth before or later.
"I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think I need to take into account the ways of measurement that are now used.
Biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can't determine it with confidence, we should not do what we can,” he said the newspaper “Metro”.
However, Gerancen from the Court Medical Agency said to the precision of tests: “In general, the risk of taking a child is wrong for a adult.
With the greatest risk, we are looking forward when a person will soon be 18, in that case he's about 10 per cent."

The opposing office and based in Tobruca, the Libyan Parliament accused Italy to violate the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army of the Feldmarshal Haftar gave his subordinate order to oppose the Italian ships.

How the financial rules of football affect the transition of Neïra to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited contracts from the Peopian football clubs will not be limited to the World Transfer Record of Neʹra from the Spanish ‘Barcellona’ to the French Pari San-Jerman.
Any consequences may have been made more on the top, for Pary San Jerman from the WEFA, the controller of the Peace football, in which the power of prohibiting the teams to participate in the pursuant tower "Lega Champions".
In 2011, the financial rules set out in the WEFA should, at the end, show that the transmission of Ne ihrra was financed without major losses.
“Barselone” was paid 222 million (262 million dollars) only for the exemption of the brazilian from the contract, and Naimara will receive a complaint that will make ten millions of dollars per year.
There are some financial and Neʹra's transfers to France.
The ‘PSI’ can be exhausted to take the Neʹra and add it to the gale of other stars if it is part of the team of the rich energy of the Catarr family.
Clubs have the right to treat major amounts for players, but they have to evaluate them in the account of legal income sources in order to achieve the rentability of their football business.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after its election by the President of the WEFA in 2007.
The former French footballist believed that the clubs in the Great Clubs in their effort to succeed, actually, were devastated and risked by destruction if banks or owners had stopped the employment.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on clubs, and instead, it was changed to follow their debt.
Following this change, the business model, which Roman Abramovich expressed in Czech in 2003, was to buy a club with a good potential and then seriously delayed in order to improve the team and create a world border, became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year period of the Clubs in 2018 may be borrowed by 30 million.
And despite that the Platins were deceived from the presidential station in 2015, his recipient at the WEFA Alexander Cheferin is still determined to keep excessive traces.
"The FP is alive and we will move forward to the rules," said the Associated Press Agency in the last week, "Andrea Traverso, controlling the FIFP in the WEFA.
Although the SSH and pay the salary of the Ne­Parage at the same time, it may, in order to report, fix this amount for all the time of its contract.
Nemar signed a five-year contract, so the transmission value could be shown in the annual report as a debt of 44.4 million per five years.
During the first wave of the FFP sanctions in 2014 to the PSH and to Abu-Daby Manchester City, the most serious sanctions were applied.
The PSH was set up in 60 million (in this case it was 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million, and it was prescribed to set up its team in the League Champions during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players in place of 25.
WEFA follows clubs that may try to interrupt its financial inspections by spending their income for the company's owners of the club.
Although the catarr company could propose “PSI”, but if the amount of the amount was considered to be a higher standard market estimates, the FEA would not allow it to be a legal income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014, when WEFA claimed that the amount of the AIDS from the Katara tourism Office was deteriorated.
It was reported that the part of Neʹra in the ‘SH’ could be held in the form of the Organizational Committee of Peace Champion 2022 in Catarre.
However, the PSH and Katar-2022 refused that Neymar would become a partner of the world's campaign, and such a manager could easily find the WEFA inhibitors.
The past sanctions imposed on the ‘SH’ means that the FEA would still be more able to follow any effort to join rules.
As reported on Thursday, the WEFA did not report the preliminary discussions with the PSH on the basis of the Neiae Transfer.
They communicated with the Associated Press Agency under the conditions of anonymity, since they are not authorised to discuss the position of the AIDS.
According to the latest reported report, in 2015-1016, more than 10 million “SH” were reached at the carrier in 542,4 million.
The report for the last financial year has not been reported yet.
The ‘PSI’ expects the arrival of Neʹra to be a pleasant farm for sponsoral transactions, sales of attributes and footballs from the logo of the team.
The club assumes that the traffic will grow at least 30 per cent of the result of a new player.
The Spanish ligue tried to interrupt Ne ihr'ra transfer by claiming that the SSH would distort the financial "fair-yee".
“This is the evidence of the “finansious duty”, with the club and the State,” stated the Spanish newspaper “AS” President La Ligi Havjer Tebas, meaning that the final owner of the PSJ is Katar.
Arsenal Trainer, Arsen Venger, whose club belongs to the American magnate, divides the doubts of La Liga on the conduct of the Club by the State.
“This is all the consequences of the lower participation, and this has completely changed the landscape of football in the last fifty-years”, stated on Thursday Venger.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is very difficult to keep the financial facility, because there may be many ways in the country and many reasons to be presented as such a serious player.
The order and the place of prosecution will determine the President
Where and how the new Russian citizens will reach loyalty to the RF, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading of the respective law as the Committee of the House on the Law of Action and Construction.
A week ago, deputates are trying to determine the provisions of the law.
From the introduction of a complaint, children to 18 years will be released, as well as non-deeps, from the text of the amendment to the Act of Citizenship of the RF (the "Reports") which the Committee will consider before the second reading of its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of the introduction of the jury in the RF citizenship instead of the formal signature of the documents of President Vladimir Putin, on 6 June, supported the meeting with the Viceславe of the Government.
Deputates made this idea in the form of amendment to the second reading to a legislative draft which provides a cancellation of the issue of citizenship to those who later were condemned for a number of crimes of terrorism or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or public resources in SMEs or in the Internet (No. 225.2. UCF), as well as for aircraft, carrying or water transport, but only if this is an action with terrorism (p. 4 p. 211 UC RF).
According to the legislative project, his log was that by forming documents for citizenship, a person is signed under the promise of compliance with the Russian law, which was raised in the way of extremism, he violates that promise.
The draft legislation was introduced in April to the House by the leaders of the opinions fractions Vladimir Va Yeves ("Single Russia"), Gennadium Zuganov (KPF), Vladimir Girinski (LDR), Sergei Miranov (Russian Justice) and Shoper G. Veceслав Wolodin.
19 May, deputates adopted him in the first reading.
In the last week, the Committee on Construction and Legislation confirmed the text of the legislative project for the second reading, but now it was revised.
It now states that the proposal order will be established by the President of RF.
Earlier parliamentaries were intended to describe the procedure directly in the Law on the Citizenship of the RF, stated that the ceremonie should be in a competitive situation before the State Herb and the Russian flag in the presence of the representative of MVD.
However, the text of the legislative project was not understanding where such activities should be carried out - the reference of the RF Herb where possible, is regulated by the respective federal Constitutional law.
Their number includes courts, offices of the heads of the bodies of members, municipal education, judges, prosecutors, heads of the federal authorities of the Executive Authority, etc.
Most likely, that could be the ZAGS.
Producering a competitive claim that would like to obtain the RF citizenship will be after the executives will check their documents.
However, the Russian passport will only be received after it brings a swear from the text.
A week ago, the project said that the prosecution should be signed before.
The updated text states that Russia ' s promise will be 18 years old, not 14 years old.
The rule was maintained to be released from the provision of the prosecution of non-sufficiency or desp, as well as those who cannot make, read or subscribe the text of the prosecution manually.
In addition, President RF has the right to free from this procedure and " other persons"
The renewable legislation has also been published in the Russian citizens of Ukraine, which are considered Russian carriers.
They should be officially rejected from Ukrainian citizenship by providing a corresponding statement to the authorised body of Ukraine.
A notarily assured copy of the statement should be submitted to the Russian factors.
The refusal of "external" citizenship, as now, will not be required if it is provided by a contract or if it is not "in force of non-dependent reasons".
The respective amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputates, including the first vice-picker GD Ivan Melnik (KPRF), Natalia Poklonska, Paul Krascheniners and Irat Farrahov (all "Single Russia").
I think many of you know that you can get help from Ukraine increasingly, simply not.
Consequently, a lot of people who decided their judgment on the conduct of the Citizenship of RF, explained the penalty of the Court of Justice and the law of Paul Krascheniners (ER).
Furthermore, the text indicated that the employment of certain debts for foreigners would not be extended to those who were writtenly rejected from the " other" citizenship and made an ancient passport to Russian SMEs, but "for reasons not depending on it" did not stop it to be a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited to carry out posts in the municipal service to be adopted in the areas and in the organizations of which Russia's security is ensured.
Another person with double citizenship or a species of residence in another country may not be a deputate of the House or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from 1 September 2017, and to that moment sub-legal acts should be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes lower in the American Soir's Jark and the Baby's Creation
The present history is notalgicly reminded of the honorable days of personality in the 80 ’ s; about the epoch of Grange in the 90 ’ s (approximately when the master David Wayne and Michael Shevalter made a comedic for MTV) and itself is about 2001, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Paul and Paul Radd, were moved to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is the simultaneously highlighting and enlargement of our era with its continuous reminders from Facebook.
But as a franches she's anacronism.
"The first day of the camp" was a good surprise, not only because of the absurdist humor (including the original story of the speaking bank of fruit, which H. John Benjamin had heard).
The result is a major challenge: Medium age actors play sexually concerned children that have only reached age; it does not make it possible to return to a part of the shot.
"Teen years later", where adults were played, has less deep emotional roots and his parentality is more unsystemic and includes riffs from the 90-year-old films of the "Ruki, the rising collibe".
In one episode, the person gets Apple Powerbook, the four-chirurgy rolls and the "cook of other things from 1991".
The same is the same.
Well-friendly Kup (Shoolter), now the writer, has not yet been able to get each other from Cathy (Margerith Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't yet been dismissed with the girlfriend.
And there is still a foolish and slow conviction in which Ronald Reagan (a.k.a. Shawolter), which now encourages George Bush older (the experienced parent in the fulfilment of Michael Jan Blake).
Like always, the best part of the franches is declining from it.
Especially pleasant to see the everlasting young Council, who sing the song of Matt Dillon from the "Single", whose personality, the former big Andy, looks old now.
The success of this franchise could be made by accidental insults in the spirit of the Seven Up recursive series until it comes to its logical end: "The U.S. Air: twenty years later," where the company would go to the film at the last scene on the "American Mountain" film.
The "Detective" of Amazona refers to another type of nostalgia: the memories of the cold war from "Americans", "Explosive Blonds" or even "Bleska" with its images of the East and West combat.
This commodity created by Brian Gatwood and Alessandro Tanaki with the register of Riz Thomas from the television: the Roman police drama for two police in Buharest, the fight for the truth, the atheism and the marine route of the Romanian police in the 1980s.
The main roles of Gregor's life and Joseph's idealist - are playing Florin Pyersic younger and Cornelius Uli, and have been opened their dialogues in English in Chenning Tatum (the same executive manufacturer) and Joseph Gordon Lewit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But just a idea.
There are several visional shots (polises take time to watch the shoes, as Americans could look at football).
The command of the votes for the frame, including Jenny Slayt, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini, allows interestingly to play in a "intelligent voice".
But the Creative Detective is so deserving the fair likeness of an unexpected propaganda drama -- there's even a cliller in the Ronald Raygan mask -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes in the past, and it's not very often funny.
If it were to make it quickly, "Stop detective" could better handle his satyry in the spirit of agitpropa; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Employment, two people are sitting in the newsbook, who are in the gate of the hamburgers.
In the public communist, this picture says that western culture is able to make a food.
The original Roman authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our recent history, and with them.
The Call Fund for Supercubok Russia on the football between Spartack and Lokomotive is 30 million rubs.

The man stated that the dear instruments were stolen from the silence that caused a serious damage to its production.
The gaps were a total value of nearly 200 thousand rolls: two wallets, perforator, hydralic, leather.
The Watchtowers have reached the investigation of criminals and have been able to go to the residents of the Boescortostan region, friends of 23 and 24 years of age.
The MVD resistance reported that the complaints found the enterprise territory, broke the entrance door and brought out tools.
After that, the guys sold a furnished technology the first falling autoservice.
They have already been excited in the case of steel, and the right-guardians have been able to return the legal owner only to a part of the protection instruments.
Mrs. Medidava's comment on the RF and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work together.
The official representative of Mrs. Hizer Nawert expressed this declaration in response to the word of the Prime Minister RF Dmitria Medvedev on the two states.
The previous Chapter of the Russian Government stated that by adopting new anti-rossian sanctions, the United States had ended the hope of improvement of bilaterals and announced the RF's full-valued trade war.

The Bank of England will maintain rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England later declares that the rates will not be changed after the economic growth and the weak inflation had made the hearing of the possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth remains unfair, and left rates without changes between the pressure of family income.
The Specialists of the Bank's Financial Policy Committee (MPC) voted with the result of 6 against 2 for the preservation of the rates at 0.25 per cent, in this month the smallest number of members of the committee was claimed to increase the rates because the economic growth had decreased the increased support.
In its quarter report on the inflation, the bank had its prognoses to increase 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while still expected that the inflation would be increased to approximately 3 per cent.
However, the bank warned that the increase in taxes in the nearest few years would be to control the inflation claimed by brexis, and stated that the costs of the rate would probably be higher than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted in order to reject the part of the public complex measures for the development of the economy, which has been launched for a year ago after the brexit.
The beginning from February will close the plan of strict dealing that he provides to banks credit credits, although he has notified that it is now available to provide more than 15 billion pounds to 115 billion pounds.
The Bank's decision-making protocol said: “Soon the main MPC prognoses, the growth of the internal product (BDP) will remain quiet at the nearest time while the pressure on the real income of the family continues to affect consumption.”
He repeated that in order to stop the inflation, the need for “a few financial policies” would be“increased” in“a fewer” sizes than the markets expected.
The market is currently the first increase in the third quarter of the year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all increases would be “increased” and “limited”.
Bank ' s prognoses for increase in this and the year below than the proposals made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
Bank left its unchanged prognoses for 1,8 per cent in 2018.
After these news, the starling fell on a dollar and a dollar.
Pound falls by 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and 0.4% to 1.11.
The decision to not change the rates was taken after the recent growth indicators had decreased the growth expectation of increase; then the BDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, the growth, in all cases, remains at the level of 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase at the end of the year.
The latest report of the Bank on Inflation is a few ways to rejoice in households that have affected the high inflation and that you do not mean the increase in the inflation: the pressure will be strengthened, as stated by the bank, before weakening.
Bank added that the financial policy could not prevent the debt of the payments in the nearest few years, but it expects that the payments “significantly” would be restored to the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also focused on growth in the result of the future question of British goods, which results in a low rate of funds, which compensates parts of decreased consumer costs.
The decision was adopted a year after the rate was reduced to 0.25 per cent last August after the shocking results of the referendum on the outcome of the Union, which led to the rate of the rate.
The bank's evaluations, mostly, need four years to have full impact on prices and economy.
Before making its last decision on taxes, the bank increased the sound around the estimated increase of the tax, since the inflation had increased and thus experienced the strong pressure of households: three of the specialists who entered the committee asked to increase the rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation fell to 2,6% of 2,9% in July last month, although the bank's report was expected and recompensed in the next months.
According to the bank, a higher point in comparison with the planned 2 per cent is the result of the low rate of pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Coreco Hypothetic Brokers Company, said: "If the recent fall of the supp courses, the hypothetic market will be again more competitive, since the creditors require business-essential and consider the good end of the year.
The bank seems especially favorable to those who approach their contracts, since refinancing of credits, often with the possibility of the Commission and with an increasing tax, becomes popular as never.’
The State Service of Health will provide a calling for AIDS 10000 persons
Since September, patients will receive access to the "revolutionary" medicinal product for HIV profile after battle in the High Court on the Declaration of Medicines from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-exhibition profile of HIV (PPE), tablet adopted before sex, which, as probably, reduces the risk of infection for persons in the risk group, in average of 86 per cent, will now be provided for a health service during a starting three-year period of approximately 10000 persons.
It agreed to finance an exam after the appointment court had maintained the establishment of the High Court last year, in which it was approved that the National Health Service had the possibility of paying EP, despite its statement that it had to be made by the competent authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called the "greatest innovative" President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National Control Management for the Proliferation of AIDS (NAT) called it as a "reverse moment".
Before the full implementation of the programme throughout England until April 2018, Venerological Disposers in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpoule and Shephilde will begin to register people, and more dispensers will be joined to the programme in October.
The pre-exposition profile (PPE) is the rate of HIV medicines adopted before sex to reduce HIV infection risk.
As shown in studies, the EIB reduces significantly the risk of HIV infection among people in the risk group.
When the EEP is adopted before sex in human body, it is sufficient for a number of medicinal products to prevent HIV infection.
The appropriate medicines may be taken daily or less than two hours before sex.
Patients who have the right to get the medicine are related to homosexual and bisexua men, transgenders and people whose HIV partners are and whose treatment is not successful.
The distributors will choose appropriate participants, agree to participate in the investigation, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are not concerned whether HIV status is maintained by antiretroviral therapy.
The people who are able to be assigned to the general physician in England are also able to provide a request for the potential participation in the nearest veterological dispenser to participate in the programme.
The programme will cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England this week after the international tender for purchase signed the Treaties on Medicinal Safety.
The study was thus built to evaluate all the possibilities of the EIB for the collection of clinical data on the purpose of the medicinal product, its approvability and application.
"The most important innovative training should be supplemented and strengthened by the broad-sized and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another challenge for more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats with which the health is affected.
Debora Gold, President of the NAT (National Control Management of IAID), stated: “This is a turnover moment in combating HIV.
If it is gratefully encouraged to humans, needed to help and risk risk, it can change the situation of HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people in the HIV risk group will receive access to the new opening new opportunities for the use of a person to control itself without discussing it with a partner that will lead to improvement of many lives.
We welcome this news bitterly."
Jan Green, President of the Terrens Higgins Fund, said: “Now, firstly, we need to be concerned that the experience is quickly spread throughout the country, and that no one of the HIV risk groups should be forgotten.
Now, when we are able to provide a experimental medicinal product, we are going to protect more than 10000 people in HIV risk areas."
The Team Minister for People's Health, Sharon Hodgesson, said, "We welcome the beginning of the EIB's experience, it has been very depressed for months of delays and delays from the Government."
Data show how revolutionary this medicine can be as part of our approach to prevent HIV and stop transmission of this rock infection.
This expression will draw us close to the full understanding of the priorities of the EIB.
Now it is important that the exposure is as far as possible throughout the country to protect the persons in the HIV risk group and to move us to the end of the HIV distribution in the community.
The World Conference of Tatar adopted a resolution on the support of the Tatarstan and Russian Treaty

In Russia, there were difficulties in receiving guidelines
GIDD's Departments test the deficit of driver certificates (IMU).
In order to get such rights, we have to wait for a few weeks, which has become a real problem for the refugeers who want to leave outside the border of their car or to take it there.
It is important to note that the situation with driver certificates remains opposed.
The MVU was entrusted to make the security police easier to understand what is written in the national certificate, since information in it is explained in five languages.
Requirements for rights are recorded in the Venice Convention on the Road Motion of 1968, but in countries ratifying the Venezuela Convention, Russian rights are also recognised.
However, all of this depends on specific police or procate offices: some require MVU and some have sufficient national rights.
In order to ensure, the rights of the leaders are still obtained, but it is necessary to be taken into account that the Convention of countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Me ́ca, Indonesia) does not allow the authorities to recognize national rights or MVU.
The problem with the black are currently monitored in all the GIDD sections, reporting the Commercent, through a number of regions.
Yes, in Moscow, the UHIBD talents are just not issued, the blacks are not enough for four months.
It may be recorded on the host site, but there has already been a middle of August.
In Cross-Yards, there is no "from technical reasons" to obtain "without detail, the Samaritan area is honestly saying that there are no blacks, the same situation is also in other cities.
Many mosquitoes have already occurred with the problem, and in sockets there are more often the following messages:
Irena Burmistrove, "Truly think why in Moscow gets a right?"
That's right, because the whites have been completed in all the events of the GBDD.
Elena Podkolzina: "Ask for people who know!"
We need to get the rights to be very urgent.
In Moscow, the stalls have been killed all the time before, and they are not issued (but the table can't be given).
Like the portal of the guest shows that the Spa time is free to the fig.
Did anyone try to get in another town?
Does he understand?
As explained in MVD RF, the requirements for the driving certificates were changed, thus the Goslavto Inspection Department on the establishment of new blocks are provided.
This may be a deficit, truly, what changes and words have not been reported before.
Blocks purchased the Centre for Travel Safety (CSN BDD) MVD RF and then placed them in the GIDD section.
In the past years, all contracts were concluded with AO "Gaznak": in 2014-2015, some 200 thousand MWU blacks were made, in 2016 15 thousand blacks were buyed, in 2017 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the OO " First Printing Court" for 70 thousand blacks.
There's a version that the CSN just didn't make a tender at the time, so it was a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of blacks: because of the crisis, many people began to be self-free, not in the regions of Asia, China, Thailand, and so far.
What rights there are, at the end, not clearly, so people are wary, so there was an ageful question on the "curs".
Recently, professional leaders have to be tested for their debt.
With this proposal, Mindrands said.
The International Guideline Certificate (SME) of the new model is operated since 31 May 2011.
The Ministry of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the Criminal Mountain Construction
Ukrainian Justice Minister Paul Petrenco stated that he did not believe in Russia’s ability to build a pool in Cryme.
On Friday, 4 August, he said this in the "Observe" portfolio.
No international company that respects itself will even put a bottle or a bottle there because it risks to lose its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries associated with the sanctions against the Russian Crime.
"It is my deep conviction, but it does not really have this project," Peterenco said.
He added that Russia considers that the major infrastructure project would be self-sustained.
Russia can not normally build smaller objects.
I know that after Olympiade in Sochi, the whole stadiums have started to be disrupted.
"I therefore believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so unvisible to join this project," said the complainant.
On 31 July, the builders ended the outcome of the Crym Mountain's Criminal Arch.
The rubber of the rubber has been completed by the car to the ark of the Crym Mount: its composition will be locked at 45 metres from the co-action.
"In the same time, the pool builders prepared for the establishment of railway oppositions," reported in the Instruction Centre of the project.
In April, the Chapter of Minrents and the Cocktails of the President of Russia Vladimir Pu was informed that the exhibition of the object and with the care of the grapher.
The Criminal Mountain consists of the Criminal Semi-Easts and the Cross-Site.
In Spain, a journalist who was not walking for 10 years had been released
What, then, should the angelic patience (or absolutely unlikely to the State Service) be held by the leader of the Spanish leader Carles Resio?
Permanent transition was held for 10 years.
However, Mr. Resio was still released.
But not your direct leader.
What's not happening in the world of bureaucrates.
The travelers seem to have been used for a long time to all the shoes of the people's servants.
Yet, the lawyers are always able to surprise those on whom they will be worthy.
This time the "sensation" was deceived from Spain.
There the Valencia Valencies Carles Resio has been wise for ten years not to go.
In this case, he received a claim regularly.
The whole soldier is 50 thousand per year.
And here's Mr. Resio's "wonderful times" finished.
He was approved by the decision of the Valencia ' s assembly law.
In the investigation, a bad player came to the office every morning at 7:00 a.m. to note the electron system.
And I went home here.
Once again, he appeared on the slave at 16:00, so he would notice the system that he had gone again.
And that's 10 years.
Moreover, it was evident that all the free time of the player was dedicated to the drawing of comics at home.
The deputates now think how to punish Mr. Ressio directly, who could not know how to " work actively" on his servant's subjection.
The Courts shall protect from the Presidents
The Chairman's Board on Human Rights (HH) on the mandate of Vladimir Pu repeated proposals to strengthen the independence of the jurisdiction of the authority.
The Court chairmans shall be able to be able to be elected and to make their elections.
For the Courts of Appeal and Cassation Instances, the CAS wants to introduce special areas that will not be associated with the administrative territorial share in the RF.
The Supreme Court should also provide its proposals within the framework of the Presidency.
It has been completed by proposals to strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This was conducted by Vladimir Pu of 3 January 2017, which was president after meeting with members of the Council.
At the meeting with members of the Council on 8 December 2016, the cases of judicial origin and the issues of public control in citizens' places were discussed (see " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the end of the work of the CH, 25 proposals were addressed as issues of the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as of the courts and of the jurisdiction of education.
One of the cremlew rights defenders' ideas is to carry out the power of the court presidents to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate at the office of the court has successfully passed the concurrence and has received the support of the court community, the President of the Court, according to the opinion of the CH, should be subject to the designation without the right to refuse the right of this law now.
It is also proposed to leave the Chairman of the right to determine cases for the exam between judges.
To do this, experts allow, may be a specially written computer program.
The President also believes that it is not able to "determine the results of the jurisdiction of the judge, initiate it by disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
The Presidency Council therefore considers to go to "the presidents of the courts' elections by the judges themselves" and "to grant them their powers to compare an uncontinued time with the commitment."
All the presidents of the Court (of the Response to the Regions) are now appointed by the President of the High Court of Justice RF for six years.
In order to rebuild judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the CAS will reorganize appeal and cass in the courts of the general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial share in the FN.
The CR states that "only agencies of separate courts should be ensured not at the level of regional courts in the RF, but in the court areas."
Experts shall be based on the arbitration courts.
They have " judicial areas" which do not coincide with the administrative share in the FP but guarantee that it is a major independence from regional operators whose use of "phone rights" is difficult.
The World Courts will strengthen the national meetings in order to consider some " civil and administrative categories" with their participation.
For example, about the derogation of parents' rights, the restoration of the rights, the protection of honour and dignity, the derogation of leading rights, etc.
"This is only our proposals," explained the "E" member of the Constitutional Court of Justice of Tamar Mortstak.
She also claimed that the Chairman ' s mandate was not only to the CR but also to the Supreme Court, which has not yet discovered its proposals.
There is still a time to carry out the mandate of the PS (in the middle of the Gen-Procuratory and the human rights authorised in the RF).
To add Vladimir Putin to the efficiency of the independence of justice in the RF, the president of the UK Viceслав Lebedjev must be held up to 1 September.
Living a high life: Half-year and thirst designers have converted this small apartment to Erls Cort into a space apartment
Joan Lee, an ex-banker, who was aware of the restructuring of the insecurity, moved from the space house to Nitsbridge to the apartment to Erls Cort in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first stage of the sympathic house in the style of the Queen of Anna, and in the benefit of the new design, Joan has not collected his things and not moved again.
"I lived with my former in Natesbridge on a lot greater area," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable to my money.
I was shown this apartment in Erles Cort, and there were the same high-coats here.
I loved it and offered a price on the same day."
Since the first review, the apartment was overtaken by 1,000 square feet.
It was essentially a apartment with one complex room planning - to get into the room - to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add spaces to keep things and half-case in order to extinguish polyes from the height of the pools.
"I wanted high walls, big windows, many lights.
"That were my demands," she says.
For this purpose, it took Erfan Azadi from Notting-Hille →Turno-Designer Study, so that they would have a half of 12.5 feet high and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project but would like Joan to live.
The floor was not enough to build two places above each other, so the →electrical task was to create a half-eetage where it could be in full growth.
Ear had to think creatively to cope with the brif.
"The work with steady actions is very complicated," he explains.
"We had to set the places so that they would be on each other, and they should not be destroyed.
It was not simply to build a simple formula, so that they could be in the right height and allow them to use the top and below.’
This decision enabled Er to establish two full-dimensional comma on each other in the deferred space, and more interesting.
With a half-sheet through a retrovuius wind-light window opens the look of a shicared guest below.
A star cell with golden, silver accents and vintage mechanisms from Serja Muya behind the project style.
Increasing, space, and light, it plays a role in the addment of apparency.
The short corridor is covered by the stars so that he seems to be longer.
On the kitchen, the window's protective window is on the other comma.
The inside of the winter is served to keep the whole stock of Joan.
In order to make a feeling of a more rare space, the beauty of the guest can cook it when it does not use it.
There's nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moveing up the door, like in the garage.
“The engineering experience has been enabled here”, says Ear’s army of the ancient-volume door.
“He is arrogant with oppositeness, so when you make it up, it will be very easy to go.”
Joan received additional 16 square metres, additional room and improved planning by means of the use of space and conservation.
"After then, the field of sex is exactly what you're going to sell, that's what your independence is evaluated," says Er.
“Grubo, the trade agency will enter into and produce accounts in the field of sex.”
Here they were able to increase the field of sex using quality materials that add to the space of rocosh.
"The materials are what we are doing, so they have helped to create a emotional relationship with the house," says Er.
"Nobody loves the electricity in the walls.
It is important, but it does not cause the flow of our hearts."
It serves as a testimony that, due to a good design and increased rate of apartment, the apartment can be converted into something of normal.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of the Cultural Policy Commission
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of the Commission on Public Cultural Policy.
The respective position was listed on the Government's website.

The Commission will also develop cultural policy projects, draw up tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Chapter of the Commission is appointed by the Chairman of the Government of the RF.

Inflation in the G20 countries was reduced to eighty-year-old
The Wall Street Journal reports that the data of the Economic and Development Organization (OECD) are reduced by the growth of consumer prices in G20.
According to OECD evaluations, the inflation indicators in June 2016 were 2% - lower values were noted in October 2009 when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported the reduction in the consumer price index in Russia to 0.1 per cent.
Thus, the consciousness was the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The Inflation Target in Russia, which I calculate Minfin, consists of 4,1 per cent.
Mineconomics, however, believe that the target value is already a 4 per cent of the indicator.
Path of warning against the illegal exhaust of the Baikal Times
The Russian leader Vladimir Putin at the meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory was warned of illegal forests.
The Ministry of Natural Resources Sergei Donski noted that a legislative project had been prepared before.
He allows the forest to be exhausted during the eradication of fires, and the Government plans to take it already.
In its course, the President stated that the project should be monitored so that "out of the exhaustion process" would not be exhausted.
Donski noted that the draft legislation provides control by the MCS and the supervisory observations.
MI: The UNFC fighters are agreed secretly with Donbass' officers
On the line of armed opposite in Donbass, there is a regular phone connection.
The fighters of the opposing parties continue to communicate with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know about this communication in the stabs.
The WTO and Donbassian officers have communicated on the phones secretly from their high command.
This is the 4 August, "Strana.ua" reported with the participants in the military operation in Donbass.
According to the issue, the office officers know the names of their colleagues with the opposite side of the front and communicate with them every day.
Communication is totally not big: Commanders are trying to achieve some "tactic agreements".
The results of these are part of the confusion of a certain part of the front.
The journalists have been reported on the cases when he or another officer had received a complaint on the day of birth from his formal responsibility.
WTO and DNA and LNR fighters are sitting on the border line of the 2014 weight when Ukraine has started a fighting oper against Donbass.
The MIDA disturbed the blocking of the United Nations Affairs on the Affairs of the RF
The Russian External Polyte has been charged by the actions of certain west diplomatic representatives who blocked the United Nations Subeza statements in the press condemning the terrorism of the RF staff in Syria.
This reports the Russian IMI.
In fact, Russia's capital territory in Damask the third time a month had been shot by the terrorist group Heath Tachryr Ash-Sham (ex-Jabhat an-Nusra) and the "Filak Ar-Rahman".
Taking into consideration that the international community is unilaterally in the Qual of the Nurse as a terrorist of the organization, and the United Nations resolutions call for the opposition of this structure, MID RF noted that "the Terakters of Nurse should meet a generally unconditional and determined conviction, and in the assessments of the outcome against diplomatic representations there should be no double significance."
However, as stated in the discretion, "the third time a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council were locked by the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short declaration of the Security Council for the conviction of terrorist attacks to the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital."
Desiring to demonstrate diplomatic solidarity with us will remain in consciousness of these delegations.
"The most proud of the danger of the Security Council to condemn terrorists' actions promotes them to new provocations and terrorists, allows them to feel impunity," they said in the MID and added, "It would not wish that these barbars would be convinced that someone in the Security Council would be together with them."
Vladimir Putin expressed the number of non-planned business checks
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, in the Next East Investment Project Meeting, stated that the number of non-planned checks of undertakers should be reduced to 30% of the number of plans and also stated the need for the time of inspection for ten months.
"The planned checks are generally undertaken without the responsibility of the procurement; only 2-3 per cent is coherent with the procurement, all the other and its own," cites the President TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited to drive servers and hard disks on businesses.
Furthermore, the Chairman considers that business-conferences should have the right to protect the interests of their members in the court.
"This, I hope, will introduce a certain position in the consideration of cases undertaken by the business, or with the violation of the law in the field of enterprise," said the Chapter of the State.
As the "E" reported, the morality of planning checks is the number of other types of enterprise inspections.
In May, the Business Ombudsman of Russian President Boris Titova was asked to find out that the replacement of planning checks was actually placed in non-planned (in 2015 from 21,9 per cent to 30,8 per cent), the prosecutors (16,9 per cent to 21,8 per cent), the rates (7,9 per cent to 13,3 per cent), as well as the statement of citizens (15 per cent to 19,5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10,8 per cent to 15,5 per cent).
More detailed about business checks in the "E" material "To small business has come from the other side".
Brothers fight for the imperity of the value of more than 500 million dollars
Two brothers are fighting for one of the major in Victoria Empires in the trade of more than 500 million dollars - forty years after their Italian preachers were based on dynamic.
The former Director of the Football Club of Carlton and Coulin de Lutis live in the court of Turak through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who gave against him the Supreme Court request for the section of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but in the Court of Auditors itself is increasingly disfellowshipped.
However, with Anna's mother, the brothers have 87 objects of more than half billion dollars purchased from the pounds as their family bought a Smith Street store in Colingwood in 1973.
There the family was based on the "Westco Jeans" company, which was grown in a network with 160 trade points.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
The money was involved in the insurance, and the list of the properties of De Lutis's family includes today office constructions, shares in the building in Brooklyn and Sorrento, the apartment on the Golden Hue and Mont-Buller and trade centres in the towns.
According to the agreement with Colin's father, whom Paul describes as "the main movement force and dominant identity" of De Lutis' family, he possesses about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the Court, this means that Collina's property is 316 million, and Paul is 176 million.
Section of property and money for Paul is rocked before employment.
"The Chamber proposed by Collin gives him the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first witnesses in 2015.
The first hearings in the Supreme Court have passed on Friday after several mistakes of reconciliation.
The brothers will now refer to who will control the business of which, according to Paul, Colin was excluded.
Colin claims that this is not true, but he accuses Paul in the incompatible management of some objects.
In Colin's witnesses at the beginning of the process, he says that it is hoped for the authorisation of the process.
"My Italian roots force me to consider a family as a higher priority," he wrote.
Court expenditure are as a snow com: hundreds of pages of witnesses, emails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck ́mer; both sides were attached to the most important parts, including the kingship of Allan Mayers, and the best.
Mrs. De Lutis and her relaxed husband, Louise, were immigrants from Italy; since the end of the 1950s, they managed milk bars and gastronomys, and at the beginning of 1970s, they bought a magazine in Brooklyn.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Collin opened the first family gins.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last school classes, and Paul was a boy (approximately 10 years)."
Anna De Lutis says that they and Louise who died in 2012 hoped to transfer their children to their own owners without conflicts.
"Luidge often told me that he doesn't want the brothers to understand in the court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer in the group of De Lutis; Colina says that Mark got 10 million when he went out of business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, and Luke, and Mark were "inadequate financial conditions for their own."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL Club Directors' Board and, in 2015, the Eddie’s biografie, the best one of the telescope stars.
The "Ferfax Media" joined Colin and Paul on Friday and theirs.
Only Colin answered, the text message in which it was said, because the case was not yet considered in the court, "I'm really nothing to say."
"I am very sorry that my brother Paul decided to give me a request and to treat the name of our family in the court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in evidence that he tried to satisfy the brother's requests.
"Our father wouldn't want to see how we and Paul will be in the court," he added, "is still hoped for a conflict."
This hope seemed to be disappointed on Friday.
"The decision on our case will soon be judged," wrote Collin.
The new Chapter of the Trempa plans to provide information to the President.
Others tried to do this and suffered the damage.
Maybe John F. Kelly's really gonna get it.
In that case, he'll be the first.
"Politica" reports that the new chapter of the White House is planning to provide the flow of information to the President of Tromp, including the news reports from the SME, in the hope of keeping the boss in a more quiet state.
That's what reporter J's Douzy reports.
"In the meeting that led the new Chapter of the White House, John F. Kelly with the leadership of the equipment on his first slave day, he appointed the main problem in the White House at President Donald Trompe, which he hopes to decide: bad information channels to the President."
Kelly told them that information should be translated through it - in a paper form or in a briffiny - because the President would be better to make decisions if he would receive regular information.
The diagnosis of Kelly is completely true, but others have already suffered a failure, trying to satisfy the Trump, following information to him.
The relations of President Trompa with television have been made a few decades ago - and now, when he is in the White House, his habit continues to watch television.
"When the Trump, as a candidate, was unjust about the campaign, was to demonstrate him that he had received the right about the issues that could be convinced," he said in February, "Politica" C -- Nanberg, former electoral adviser.
Tara Palmer then wrote in the Politica, that "six would be the members of the electoral station to keep the Trumpa's habit to write to Twitter, it should be followed that there should be a continuous stream of honour in its personal information."
Okay.
But the idea that Trumpa's habit to write to Twitter was sometimes "under control", it's just funny.
Maybe these members of the electoral station know something that we don't know, for example, that if they weren't, the Trumpa movies would be more provocational.
Maybe we're never gonna know about the twins that the Trump hasn't handled.
If it had been disappointed by him, at least several times, their efforts would not be complete.
But no one was able to keep the Trump from the oil to fire.
A part of the problem is that in the White House, divided by the counterparty fractions, people are always trying to move their agenda by providing the Trump material is trustworthy or not - which confirms their views.
The "Politic" - as soon as this story - wrote in May on the ability of advisers to continue to consult the President ' s doubtful information.
Here is one example described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"The current and former Trompas say that the Trump can react very rarely to the rejects of the press reports, especially containing dangerous information flows, and it will not be satisfied until the most behind them.
This happened at the end of February when someone sent the president to print the article with GotNews.com, the website of K. Johnson's producer, in which the Chapter of Cathy Walsh was accused of being "near running" at the White House.
It is not important that Johnson is always invoked in your owner for the aggressive behavior that he did not have specific facts or that in the past he had committed false accusations and then refused them.
Trump read the article and accepted the Question of Walsh."
Goldmacher adds that the current Chapter of Rains Pribus and the Secretary of the Rob Porter apparatus were "procured to build a system to manage the bully flow that receives the Trump and documents them".
How did that happen?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same.
It may be more effective than Pribus, but the Trump continues to be an impulsive nature, and its assistants continue to fight each other for the impact.
These persistent factors do the task of Kelly very difficult.
The prison prosecution fights with HIV-President
The prosecutor insisted on the establishment of the Calypine paradise of Thumen, which stopped the voting case on the residence of a resident whose little-year daughter had been ended by HIV.
As the consequence states, the children died because their mother was a HIV representative and refused to be treated.
However, the Court delivered her from responsibility in relation to reconciliation with the harmful father.
The prosecution believes that the crime would be left without punishment in order to avoid creating a preliminary for other HIV representatives.
The work on the inhabitants of the Country was excitated at 1st 109 UC RF (inspective death) in April after its three-year daughter died from HIV infection 4V.
According to the prosecutor, the mother itself is HIV-infected.
"The woman has not treated himself and has been treated from the treatment of a daughter, believeing that HIV infection does not exist," explained in the Dumping Area procuror.
The Court of Justice of the Catholic Court of Justice, which on 25 July adopted a decision on its interruption.
The dead girl's father had given this to him, explaining that "the woman had no claims to her, she was deceived and brought excuses."
The Court's decision was not agreed and granted an appointment, needing to refuse the suspension of the matter and to submit it to a new consideration.
The girl died, and the caused crime is not fair.
A HIV-infected mother, despite the recommendations of doctors from the investigation and treatment of a child from a dangerous infection," reported the prosecutor in the press service.
According to the supervisory body, it must be punished, elsewhere other HIV-advisors follow it.
As stated in the German Centre of IDA, about 12 children who are HIV diseased now do not receive medical assistance because of the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already been improved - for the year of the special group, half parents, category refusing to treat children from HIV, changed their opinion - allowed diagnosis to be diagnosed, made medicines," - Rass' Press Secretary of the Centre of Helena Losew.
According to her, the law does not have a way to exercise parents, and not all HIV infected children can be found - mothers do not allow them to be investigated, hidden, flee with children from the hospital.
The risk of HIV-Assistents
At the end of the past year, Petterburg sociologists have resulted in the first investigation in Russia of the HIV-Assistant movement.
HIV members call people who refuse HIV employment and refuse to take medicines.
Medicinal and Serb-Id activists call such views as an anti-medium, and they see serious threats in their distribution.
On Thursday, 3 August, the rare session, which ended the tragedy, took place for the railway of the Greek in Chmelnic.
The famous company of young people was spent by the boss over the railways, where the train was once.
One of the friends had the idea of making an effective self on the wheel, reported "FACTAM" in the communicating sector of the police in the Nemelnic area.
The boy started to get down from the boss to the road, but because of his invisibleness, he took the electro-transmission line and got a hit at the moment.
Fortunately, this was the case of an expert, who immediately called "inconsistency".
Before the arrival of the harmful doctors, hospitalization was moved to a safe place, and then the hospitalised to the Chmelnic region of the hospital.
Mans were diagnosed by 1 to 2 degrees.
The doctors now evaluate it as a stability.
Rightguarders recall that the large population has recently received the extrém of the selfs on the crops of polyesters, pools that move the transport.
Police calls people to be careful and not allow such sessions, especially among children and adults.

The cigans overflow the roofs and returned to the “three of millioners”
Of the most stated west Midland householders, they are again conflicting with determined cigarettes that have overcome the exhibited municipal authorities of the River to take the field near their homes.
Cygans have parked 20 houses in the field border with the rich Solihal Street, which had the name "in millions".
By bringing boys, kids, and houses on the wheels with them, they returned after they were cast no more than in May, and did not interrupt the roofs issued by Municipal authorities to prevent their injury.
This taking company found a break in defence arms and opposed its vehicles through parts that have left non-conduits to leave a place for the tromping.
Explained inhabitants in the Municipality of the Solihal, saying that he was "incapable of resolving this problem".
Anonymous resident reported: "They came here on Monday evening after they were cast out from Bentley Hit, where they had cut stones in the past."
The Municipality should be encouraging and imposed on it because they are unable to resolve this problem.
The cigans were here in May, they were gone away, and here they returned.
Last night, there were more cigans and maybe more today.
"Birmingham's Municipality knows how to resolve this problem, they receive long-term courts to protect their parkings," she added.
I'm on Straitsb's road, and I don't like that I'm keeping a municipal duty, and the municity can't even end this."
A person who wanted to remain anonymous said: "This is funny, we have just seen how these cigarettes go for the past, and, please, this attack continues."
This time they became more, and We have seen how the cattle fell on the ground."
The representative of the Municipality of Solihala stated: "We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Stratsb's road and co-operate with the half of the Solihal; we make legal action in order to lose them as far as possible."
To help us in the congregation of witnesses, it is very important to inform any antisocial or criminal conduct at the phone 101 as far as possible.
This allows us to present a presentation of the situation that will consider the court when we do our case to them.

The GAP of the Crym "New World" has been determined to act by converting the Champagne's Vineyard "New World" to the OAO "The New World of Champagnes", should be provided by the Minister for Agricultural and Agricultural Crime of Anna Anuhin.
100% of the enterprises will remain in Cryme's hospitality.

The Ministry of Agricultural Agriculture stated that if there are no funds for modernising undertakings in the nearest three years, there will be a threat to the removal of the detention.
The export of basic funds to the undertaking consists of 60-70 per cent.
For modernised enterprises, 1,2 billion rubs are required, and, in particular, the organizational legal form is required to provide 50 per cent of the income of the budget.
What remains is not enough for the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner hardly, speaking about the employment of large credit organisations," said the Mineselhose Cryme Sergei Petelin's head in April of this year.
The Cryme Parliament included an undertaking in a preliminary privacy plan for 2017.
It was proposed to carry out its action and the markets.
The Interfax source in the authorities of Crime has increased the value of the sale of undertakings in $40 million, the investment in the modernism is $30 million.
The New World increased the production of playing wine by 2,8 per cent compared to 2015 to 1,52 million bottles.

Underground third-party groups have disgraced more than 40 overbursts
The NGOs in the Netherlands have established citizens' identities, spread 46 bursts in the town of Liskovo.
The criminals became disciples of the third class.
The first statement that the sepulchries were not harmful was made to the Russian OMS on the Liscow region on 27 June.
In this context, 24 persons were addressed to the field.
Consequently, the voting case referred to in Article 244 of the CFR " Destruction, Poverty or Defense".
Following the consequences of the police, two schools of 8 and 9 years were established.
Incomplete legal offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing how the memories were understood and encouraged them to promote humanitarian action.
Children and their parents have prophecies.
Italy has a tone to NGO ships that save migrants.
Italy warned the NGOs who belong to the Courts in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue if they were not subject to new rules governing their activities.
"If the NGO is not subject to the new conduct code, it is difficult to say whether they are able to continue their activities," said the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Mario Minniti in the interview of the Turin's daily newspaper Stampa.
Minniti warned on the day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization " Jugend Rettet ", doubting that its equipment actually cooperates with traffickers and facilitates illegal immigrants.
The humanitarian committee, on the entire year, has been made from the comments on the detailed accusations imposed against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartosio.
"The salvation of life for us is and remains a higher priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot now continue in the search and salvation area," states the organization in society.
"We will be able to evaluate all the accusations now, only after we and all information and we are able to evaluate the situation."
The Italian authorities follow the "Jugend Rettet" vessel from October.
His equipment is suspicious that he has completely rescued the ship of migrants whose traffickers were sent to them and allowed the contrabandists to go with the ships they could use again.
At least one meeting, likely, had only 1,3 miles from the Libyan Power, so it was approved in the materials of accusation that the content had been reported in the Italian SMEs.
The Equipment is suspicious of the provisions of the Italian Âg authorities that control the security of operations in this area, more humanitarian, than any other motivation.
The Code of Behavior assumes, mainly, that the Court of Youths will have on the board of the Italian police, which will follow their activities.
Until only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations agreed to submit the code: "Spaste Children", Malta MOAS and "Pro-Activa Disployed Volumes" from Spain.
Following its statement on Thursday, it considers new rules unnecessary but acceptable when they will not affect any " significant changes or disturbances" to be saved by operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is also the Nobel Premium of the " Doctors Without Border" (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti said that a rare reduction in the last weeks of migrants coming to Italy as a result of the salvation of operations indicated that the efforts to support Libyan protection and cooperation with the Mediterranean are fruitful.
"In the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported plans for further negotiations with Libyan measures on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who left these countries in hope of reaching them.
"We don't want to associate any of the sides of the conflict in Libya"
The Government of the RF has recently actived its policy in Libya, and with visits in Moscow, delegations of the opposers of Libya have participated.
The Chapter of the Russian Contact Group on International Resolution in the IMI RF and Gosdome, assistant of the Chapter of the Czech Republic of Lev Dingo, told " E" what objectives Moscow is to follow in this region and to whom it makes a tax.
It's almost nothing about the contact group on Libya you're heading.
Here, let's say, the Ukrainian contact group knows everything about it.
And here's a secret box.
What specifically are you doing, what goals are you pursuing?
The contact group was established at the initiative of MID RF and State Words.
Its activities are currying the foreign minister of Michael Bogdans and Adam Delimhan (deputate of the Words from Chech. - "U").
The latest is able to work on the Libyan direction by the Hosdom Veceславe of the Government.
As a result of the establishment of the group, there were 11 persons at the board in the Russian Dancer " Mechanics Chebotarov " in September 2015.
We're looking forward to how to help the equipage.
There was then established a contact group of military experts, representatives of the House, supported the Chapter of the Chapter of Czech Ramzan Kadirov.
How did you do what you've put her up?
Since I have worked on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to address the group.
Our activities have not been freed from the Mechanic Chebotarov.
We have been able to set contacts with representatives of all the main groups opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripole (which is based by the United Nations recognised Government in the Chapter of Fisherdge. - " U") and Tobruc (the House of the Government, which is opposed to the Government and supports the Chalifu Haftara Marshall, which controls the Eastern regions of Libya. - " U")
As a result of the active participation of Ahmed Matthew (the Vicepresident of Libya - " E"), we have soon agreed on the freedom of Russian mariners.
Then it was decided to make a contact group more effective and more effective.
It is an analysis of the situation, the detection of key factors and players, the dialogue with all sides of the conflict.
I want to stress: we do not want to associate with any of the sides of the conflict in Libya, we are dialoging with all.
How many people are in the contact group, and how many of them are still in Libya?
There are now five people in the contact group.
There are among them people experienced in power structures, including in the Defence Ministerial.
We also want to include a group of specialists on the region, representatives of the Middle East Institute.
No one is still in Libya of our responsibility, yet there is no need.
Are there now Russian military advisers and actors in Libya?
And if so, on which side?
There are no Russian military experts in Libya.
All terms and comments of this do not correspond to the fact.
But your contact group's former soldiers...
Yes, and their presence needs.
For example, when we visit bitter points.
Or those closed for us until a certain time as the Misurat (based on the groups of meetings playing a role in the commitment of the Libyan leader of Muammar Kaddafi in 2011 and noticed in the following years. - "U")
We came to Missurate in January this year.
We were scared, they said that there were all the islamists, terrorists.
But we were important to appreciate the situation itself, to analyze the real military potential, which answers why the hearings of the islamists are in reality.
In Mysurate, we met all the representatives of the offices held by the IG in Syrte (in December 2016 this city at the Mediterranean Sea was rejected by the fighters prohibited in Russia "Islam State" - "U").
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to check that they were actually playing a decisive role in the IG in Libya, not Calif Haftar, who had registered these services.
And what's the result you came?
Is the Islam State in Libya won not Haftar?
It wasn't him.
Haftar operated on another front, in Bengazi.
And with IG in Syrte, there were structures undergoing the Government in Tripoli.
And, in fact, we invited people to Russia to conduct this anti-Terrorist oper.
And they arrived - the visit was extended from 19 to 23 April of this year, and the Libyan delegate adopted in the Council of the Federation, in the Dume, the Middle and the Rosgwarddia.
You, as we have learned, are in all the regions of Libya and probably represent the designs of the elite and the field commanders.
How do you think it would be able to conclude the agreements on the breakdown of fire, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris, Calif Haftar and Faiz Saradge?
Or again, how did this happen again in the past, the agreements will be suspended, the fighting action will be repeated, and the parties will try to take a single authority?
For us, the fact that Saradge and Haftar agreed on a regular meeting was not so long.
In recent times, both leaders were extremely negative.
What's the position of Russia...
Often they write and say that Moscow is actively supporting Haftar, many believe in it.
We met this situation when we were in Mysurate, and Haftar just this day was raised to the Russian Aviationist Admiral Kuznecs.
That was a coincidence.
But they did not believe in Mysurate.
We said, "You are probably very courageous people who have come to us today."
But our task is to show that we are not only supporting Haftar, we are dialogueing with all key participants of the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have communicated.
Is it easy to comprehend with Russian partners at a emotional, emotional level that he has been learned at the SSR twice?
And, in fact, Haftar knows Russian language?
He's Russian, if he knows, it's very hard.
But what he learned us, of course, makes it easy to dialogue with him.
And not only with him.
When we communicate with military officers in Tripoli and Mysurate, we meet generals who have learned in Russia or even in the Council Union.
And here they're talking Russian.
And they're looking at Russia, sometimes they're trying a nostalgia on it.
Do you consider the probably cancellation of the weaponsbargo Libya?
Do your Libyan meetings interact with Russian weapons?
They are, of course, interviewed, but, as I already said, we do not have any side in this conflict, and we would not want to invade each other in harm.
We would like all to be almost in positions.
As weapons of the army bargo, the Libytes continue to sound calls to make Russia a progressive record of it.
Now in Libya, the process of constitution continues actively.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise decisions, covering internal consensus.
Then the elections were to be held at the meeting of Sarah and Haftar.
If the elections are and the end of the election will be chosen (and no part of the status is now undergoing), the United Nations can ask for the recording of the armsbargo in Súbbez.
To address this question now insensibly and dangerously, it will only lead to the scale of conflict.
At the time of the SME, Italia, who faced the problem of the African refugees from Libya, felt that the EU's unions were distorted.
Can Moscow in this situation help Italian partners using their connections with libanes?
For example, how valuable is that Haftar's divisions will be controlled over lives and end the business of contrabandists who transfer immigrants into Property?
Very timely question.
We work on this actively.
The Italians need support for Russia, because Moscow is a dialogue with Haftar, and Sardje, and Missurate and the south country.
In this matter, the peoples in the south of Libya play a great role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Does the Southerns say to cross the migrant flows on remote attacks?
So, in terms of the fact, the buss were back in which the Nigerian migrants were going back?
We're doing this.
But it's not easy.
The clans and groups are concerned that these flows continue to go.
We hope to promote the association of the south in the negotiation process between Sardeg, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But for the beginning, we would like to see the unity of the opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saradge.
The head of the Government in the Tripole Phais Saradge is considered islamist, a party of the introduction into the country of charity standards.
How radical is he maintained?
Will this not be an obstacle to the exhibition of Russia or West?
I'll tell my personal opinion about him.
I think he's, in turn, the opposite of the radical islam.
But the islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be a absolutely normal country - a measure of islamic, open world.
And he also actively fights with terrorists.
So where does he have such a reputation?
It was created by those countries who are not interested in that Russia should communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a hundred, there is a legal, executive and judicial authority.
There is national oil corporation, national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not going there.
And all the cards were mixed and started to communicate actively with Tripole and Tobrick.
And we have already enjoyed the fruit of this work: Rosnefth has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the State Oil Company of Libya NOC.
Director NOC Mustapha Sanalla, with which head of Rosnefty Igori Secin concluded a negotiation, directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first discharge of the Libyan petroleum of Rosnefth company.
What will Russia do with her?
I guess I'm going to sell.
What other economic interests have Russia in Libya?
Overwrite contracts held by Muammar Kaddafi.
Specific and, in particular, on previous transport agreements (for railway building), energy (electricity) and several other.
And there's something to do with the limbs?
Well, they have oil.
So, what is the case with Iran, and what about the 'neft' scheme for service exchange?
I don't know what scheme I'm going to do, directly on these questions.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main.
We're actually there in peacemakers.
For us, it is primarily to stop blood transfusion, to help the liquors to agree with each other, so that they may be able to establish a order and Libya has stopped to be a pleasant environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is a key task to help the Libyan people and to release terrorists from there.
Do you have information about the presence of a radical fighter in Libya (at this time or earlier) from Russia or other former SSR countries?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to explain that.
I met with the representative of the Libyan Safety Committee, who said that there was no outcome from Russia and other former SSR countries today.
He said that he had approximately 50 thousand of the phone records of the representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya).
What of the states are these fighters then?
I wouldn't want to figure out these details.
Then let's formulate a different question.
How many of the islamists in Libya?
Libyans are not almost in the midst of them, they are not more than 5 per cent.
The rest is coming.
Can Moscow conduct internal negotiations such as Paris?
There are such plans.
We have active negotiations with Libya, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have stated that we are ready to come to Moscow or to Grosney.
And when can such negotiations pass?
Now it's hard to say.
There must be more visits, and then I hope that there will be clearness in terms of time and places of negotiations.

The Manual Museum "Melechovo" initiated the Memorial Day of Czech on July 15 on one day of kindness in all the Museums of the Submoscow Museum.
The 30-year-old Olevska living area near the football stadium shot several times in the area of growth.
According to the suspicious, it was disappointed and reported " FACTAM" in the Communication of the Lithuania Police.
After that, the man entered a coffee that was nearby.

Michel Carter sentence for communications encouraged by the Congo's self-mord of the Royal Congo
The Massachusetts inhabitants were convicted to two and half years of conclusion that it was encouraged by text communications and telephone sounds to kill her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, has to take 15 months after the end and five years of a long time.
Carter was recognized in June for the unintentional murder of the Congo of Roy, who ended on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roya said on the hearings on Thursday, "My family was killed by the mountain.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free before calling.
She threatened the maximum time of 20 years, but she stated that she and Roy suffered psychic disorders.
Carter, dressed in the red bridges and the cream blue, listened to the sentence standing, burning his hands and laying off his eyes.
"For its actions she killed Conrad Roy," said the court official.
"He stopped his life to improve his own.
She didn't recognize the responsibility," she said.
"He's not a demonstrator of race."
But Carter said that it was a "tragic case for which she was deeply sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that its "adultness, level of adults or even psychic diseases have not been noticed on her action".
The prosecutor reads the statement of Mother Roy Line Roy, who says, "No one day I would not pay my favorite son's loss.
I want him to be proud of me and how I do -- I'm trying to support his sister, despite all the pain that remains with us forever," says it.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said she was inevitably pursuing the idea that she would never be able to attend her wedding or to become a teth of his children.
"A man who was always with me from my own birth is a pain that remains with me until the end of my life," she said.
This case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Masachusetts that would be responsible for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy found a dead car with the symptoms of fuel gas disorders, Carter was 17 years old.
The emphasis focused on the whole country when it was evident that it was understood to the self-mord of Carter's message.
"You can be thrown up with a knife, shoot yourself with a knife, I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent in two weeks before his death when he relaxed with his family.
In a few minutes before the suicide, she wrote, "You must do this, Conrad" and "You must just include burning, and you will be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to be careful with Roy's death and prohibited her to communicate with the pressure so that she would not give her what was desired.
The opinions of the lawyers in this respect were divided.
One of the few protectors of Carter was Amanda Nox, who was condemned in 2007 for the murder in Italy for his British neighbor's apartment and was justified two years later.
The 30-year-old Nox reported its opinion in Los Angeles Times, in which it was said, "Missel Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not aid."

“Audi” must modify up to 850 000 disearch cars
The Audi statement BMW stated that it would be proposed to update the software in more than 350 000 cars.
The Chairman of BMW stated that the company believes that there are more intellectual ways than leaderships, including München, where the BMW is available, which have considered the possibility of prohibition or use of design cars.
“Damler” stated on Thursday that he modified three million cars by Mersedes in the Property to reduce their diseal exhausts.
Not one of the company called his steps to revoke.
● Automotive manufacturers have actively continued the use of design cars in the United States and in order to promote the compliance with gas emission rules.
But asylum acids that choose disorders are considered as cancers and can cause astms.
The value for the vehicle manufacturers is also increased by the neutralising gases of disorders and the support of the competitive price on the car becomes difficult.
While German carriers are under adequate attention, the Government of the Angels Markel's office also accused that it touched the powerful car producers and ignored the signs of the problem.
Companys are trying to not repeat the Fallwagen errors which hided the use of such "frequency devices" which could be able to handle the number of gases that were broad in testing to comply with the rules, and they were disabled under normal management conditions.

Astronomes have found a "deep" planet on which even the iron can flow
The first study of the characteristics of the gigant exoplanates called WASP-121b, the astrophics were very surprised by its temperature that could produce iron and other metals.
The specialists noted that water molecules are so deceived by the light of the star that cause inflammation.
The Habble telescope inspired the spread of water molecules on this gas gigante: this high temperature makes water in the atmosphere of the planet to light in the infraroad area.
WASP-121b is to the denominated "breeding yuppers" - gas gigants, by sizes and mass compared to the largest planet of the Solar System, but in decades closer to the parent star.

The climate change threatens lavande in Provanse.
She became the symbol of Provans and South France, but now it is threatened that it threatened its climate change.
Lavanda became worse to grow because of suicide and overcoming insected diseases, which became the cause of continuous pain of scientists and farmers who are trying to find decisions.
Eric Shes, a expert from the Agricultural Research Institute of CRIEPPAM in Provanse, says: "The Lavanda in Provanse is actually threatened because in the past years the impact of climate change has been increasingly less.
This affects the life of lavanda.
And there are still small cycles that go on the boxes of micro-bacteria, and they become very sorrow."
It's very much on the map.
Lavanda is not only attractive to the refugees; the lavand oil is very affected in the parfumeration and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "Instead of very long bottles with a large number of large colors, we have small, unsuccessful, weak, or missing.
So we have less than parts containing efficient oil."
The decisions currently considered include increasing the distribution of water and deterioration of water, as well as the suspension of the protection of glace and water mixture and the outcome of more sustainable to suicide.

"And people around the world are that the United States and Russia should be able to work together," said the diplomat.
Instead, Nawert has been commented by Medvedev on the full-valued trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, she has, of course, the right to speak, but I can't say anything more about this subject," said the representative of Mrs Deep.
The former President of the United States Donald Tromp signed a draft law on the execution of sanctions against the Russian Federation.
In commenting on the new sanction package, the Government Chapter of the RF Medvedev stated that Washington announced the Moscow full-valued trade war by ending hope for the improvement of bilaterals.
Medvedav also stated that the United States sanctions would be made for decades.
Moreover, the Premier Ministry, the American Institution of "pure play" of the Trumpa.
The bodibilder in the Submost Bodibilder found a worm of the lost memory
Bodibilder Shamiel Hanmetov fell on the road to Noginsk on July 25, with all the big circumstances: he went out of the car salon to go to the train.
Seven days he was unrealisticly searched for known and known inhabitants.
And I found Shamile on the strange place in Ramenski.
He was found in his master's bag.
The Dagestan sportsman was not able to explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He didn't even remember his name, but the passport was lost.
To establish the person has helped the declaration of his disappointment.
It reports that the Hunmet's partial memory loss and low-mother traumatism has been called by the doctor's phone.
The sports are probably waiting for other surprises.
The criminals who buried Shamila have probably already lived in his apartment, from which the keys were also stolen.
Petroleum income in July exceeded 7.4 billion rubbles
In fact, the petrol incomes received in July 2017 exceeded 7.4 billion rub., reports the Ministry of Finance RF.
The extent, as explained by the consciousness, was primarily due to the higher exchange rates of US dollars in comparison with the middle-month value of June, as well as to increase the volume of gas and exports of oil products for the prognosed levels.
"Rejecting the Federal Budget of Petrol Income from the Montenegro, corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017, has been predicted in +40.2 billion rubs.", states Minfin's report.
Thus, the total amount of the funds for the purchase of external currency on the internal market for the period from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubs.
As a result, the daily buying of foreign currency costs 2.07 billion rubs.
The Bank of Russia will be attracted to the end of the operations of the purchase of the foreign currency of Minfin Russia.
Each slave day during the specified period, the CB will conclude transactions to buy foreign currency on the organised markets of the Moscow Birge at the same time during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be calculated on the account of the Federal Country in Central Bank.
The murder of journalists stresses that the Meeke has become more dangerous.
The members of the wedding newspaper Riodos are usually meetings in the middle to discuss the plans for the last crimes in the State of Sinaloa with the organized crime, corrupted by criminals or the uninterrupted war of drugs.
However, today, they have been met to talk about security, as they have been deceived by their own tragedy.
They said they had to change their habits.
Two elderly journalists discussed that it was more safe: taking children with themselves to the office in which they had already left the granate in 2009 or leave them home.
Safety experts wrote on the table above in the comma, three words: enemy, neutrality, unions.
They asked the journalists to call names for each person - the evidence of the fact that there is no need for suspicion, and the internal feelings will be sufficient.
These are drug operators, policies, businessmen, journalists who doubt that they are on the content of the Government or the carters, the whole list of subjects of the work on the chaos in Me Mé Mé Mémékee.
Violence does not give changes, and there are more and more journalists in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 times as President Enrico Pen Neto took his post in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and at least seven people have died in seven states in this year.
In the midst of the last, their issuer and inspirer, the foundation of the "Riodos" Haveyer Waldes Cardenas.
"The very great error is to live in Me'aka and to be a journalist," wrote Waldes in one of his many books on the practical crimes of drugs.
It feels very easier, although his presence totally is a large graph of Valdes, a medium-sized cup, with the title "Reality" at the "Riodos" phrase; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, have footballs on which his smiling, face in the eyes or his company pan.
The seminar goes less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general traumatism, cosmars, unslaughty, paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was organized in 2010 for the investigation of journalists, until the Committee for the Protection of Journalists investigated only two cases.
As in the case of most of thousands of crimes committed each year with drug traffic and organised crime, journalist killers are rarely presented before the court.
The Riodos journalists suggest that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they were killed by a cold, even though they are far more dangerous about now.
No information about murderers, without justice on security meetings, says Ibarra.
"Very stupid to take time on this seminar," he says.
"Before we don't know the reason, we're all doubting."
On Monday 15 May, Waldes left from the Riodos office to the Couliacan capital.
He could only pass a few apartments before his Red Oneot King stopped two men; he was thrown out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "the Twelve River".
The shooter went to his car and struck her nearby.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children.
They are usually quickly divided by Kuliakan.
But about Waldes, they're almost all silent.
Sinaloa -- one of the most bloody fields of battle in the country, since counterparty fractions are fighting to fill the vaccine.
We will not say that every day in Sinaloa kills one or more persons, or that the cup is filled with two-year drugs, which are more than many living people's homes.
We will forget for a minute that with the "pause" is just when one of the cards is controlled by the pre-sea state with important ports and ways of drug traffic in the United States.
Despite that Waldes knew about the dangers of his work, Ismael Bohorkes, the 60-year-old Soons and the Director of Riodos, was deceived by the feeling of the fault that he could not protect one another.
He thinks the murder helped two mistakes.
First, in February there was interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the associated card fractions that fighted with the sons of Gusman.
The P Paparation could disappoint the sons; people who were preferred to be members of the bank were buying all exemplars of the issue as they were delivered into the kiosk.
The second error was that he was not for Waldes for his own security to leave the country after the second newspaper was injured, which wrote about the same story.
Waldes was the End of Me ́s and outside the border, and his murder was considered as an enormous degree in the development of violence against journalists in Meʹka.
He was so far away from the danger, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was a experienced reporter in Noroeste and in 2003 with five colleagues founded the Riodos, sold his 50-dollar action.
"It was not worth working a journalist without a drug issue," said Bohorkes.
With time, the newspaper deserved the reputation of courageous and honest issues, sales and advertising incomes.
The journalists liked that they were able to put up courageous reports without fear of censures, and the readers argued that in this publication they could read about what no one had been able to write about.
Eight years after its "Riodos" had received a prestigious premium for Mary Murs Cabo for the reporter in Latin America.
In that same year, Waldes won the International Prince of Freedom of Press for Municipality in the investigation of drug trafficking Me, wherever it would be.
He clearly admitted that he was.
"I want to live further," he said on the CPJ premium.
The drug trade in Sinaloa -- "This is the form of life," he said in October of the past year in the Rompevento TV interview.
"You must take the tasks that lie on you as a journalist -- or you're just a fool."
I don't want to ask me, "What did you do when it was so much around... why didn't you say what happened?"
The "Riodoses" co-operators of Waldes, a shotman who was stuck as a boat in the gate, a second, worthful for the amounts and advice, a teacher who knew how to stay in the lives.
They trusted in their order.
He'd always have to have his bottle.
He had to go to "El Guaibo", bar against the office, and always sit there on the same chair.
Now they ask, ‘ Did he lose his love for the one time? ’
His death was due to the dead, and they were doubted about how to do it better and remain alive.
"They don't love when you understand" in their wives, Âses, in their business, and in the underground aircraft for drug transport.
"These things were shit," said Bohorques.
The result, even in the best time, was a high level of self-estimation and self-reservation.
We need to believe your instincts.
Keep away from what's wrong.
The problem, says the editor of the Riodos, Andrés Viljeral, is that "inflammation can be deceived... and then happens what happened to Habier."
The old rules, he and others, are no longer in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipase, Veracrusa, Guerrero and other States, where there is a huge mixture of the incoming contraband paths, public institutions and corruption.
Lundshaft's always changing.
In the committee where the Riodoses were gathered for security training, it was prompt to introduce public phones: In a few days before it, the Spanish programmes sold exclusively to Governments were used in Me ́ca to follow journalists and public activists.
Two police officers are covered in a tree of 104 degrees (40 degrees per Celsius).
The Government of the State has given them the protection of the Office of Riodos, which is found in the four-year-old opinion in the Burgaise Quartal of Kuliakan.
The journalists asked whether these police officers were not involved in those 50 per cent of the officers of the Governor himself who said to trust them.
A few months ago, journalists went to a defactory, which is under the control of drug traffickers.
The next number of the Riodos was counted on three main subjects.
It's a murder in Sinalo's brother's former champion on the box of Julio Sezar Chuves.
The Government expenditure in the town of the Governor's family was further distorted.
And there was a group of people in one of the most dear restaurants of Kuliakan, a quarter from the office of the prosecutor.
It was not officially announced who was deceived or how it happened, therefore it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write about what all in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant of drugs and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the Restaurant was registered on the name of a policy belonging to the Executive Institution-Revolution Party (PRI), which is a dominant at all levels of authorities in the nearly all of the past century.
Recently, a number of Governors from the PRI have been sentenced to a sound accusation in corruption.
William asked the journalists to write about the previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Gusman was acquired of military captures.
A few months ago, readers would seek Valdes with the most reliable inhibition of defense.
"We would already know what happened," says the 46-year-old William, for his artificial body called El Flaco.
"This has been destroyed by all channels of connection with our sources."
Valdes' cabinet is now used as a set of places and stackers with protests against the murder of journalists, because they have become those who never thought they would be: the activists in the name of the press.
Myriam Ramires' journalist took several places and went to the demonstrator at the morning in the prosecutor, dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame is gone in Michoacan at the west of the country in three days after the murder of Waldes.
They found the fired body, and the authorities declared that it was, in the testing of DNA.
In the whole country, journalists began to speak more, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the trailers and the walls of the house.
On that day, the Director Bohorkes was in Washington, trying to engage in international support in dealing with Valdes.
At the meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Waldes Ramires, the authorities accused that they were spying after journalists and ordering their murders because they said the truth.
She then asked her not to give her more tasks on the Government ' s activities, fearing that the anger would take its objective.
Waldes said many times that the journalists in Me ́ca are " circumcised" by organised crime, its partners in the Government and its independent society.
In his last book The Narco-Journalist, he wrote that reporters kill not only drug traffickers; they do it by political and security services that are negotiated with organised crime.
The Committee on the Protection of the Press " Article 19" believes that half of the attacks on journalists in the past year were agreed on the police and government officers.
"In Me, you're dead because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, murders fear people.
Everyone remembers, the loss of blogger Mary Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state Tamaulipas.
Her body found a record written by the Zetas card: "I'm here for my articles."
The computer keyboard and ears were located near its rejected Property.
The issues were preferred to conclude how the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua was killed in March after her correspondant Miroslav Brich was killed.
Others continue to keep as "El Manyan" from Nuevo Laredo after her murderer in 2004.
In 2010, Diariao de Suid Huares publicly turned to drug careers using the editing article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
The journalists abandoned their family states or country.
It's a torture decision.
It is difficult to find it in the evacuation, and they are still in danger.
And sometimes they kill, as it apparently occurred to the graph of Ruben Espinos, who was killed in 2015 with four women in Me ́co apartment three months after the run from Verakrus.
Those who remain and continue to work each day balance between risked decisions.
Ibarra, who ever thought to be a poet, admits that he was able to write about drug trade.
"I'm cut off in a cow, and so I'm a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready to print, the publishers of the Riodos were sitting on the board near the office and drinking a beer when their phones were once called.
The series of shots between the opposing bands and the security forces nearly from the Masatlan Kurort city left, according to the data, 19 bodys.
The war continued to deploy as it was promised in the series of letters from cards found in this area.
When they were sitting on the phone, they sent news on the Riodos website.
The first page had to be transformed on the day.
Nearby, the sirene was one other shooting in the surroundings.
Bohorkes saw whether they were ready to defend their police.
If they were afraid, they did not show it anyway.
Siding under the great portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose average hair was given to the overall Sinaloa, the Society of Riodos continued his case.
"How can you think of closing," said Bohorkes, "if the day when Havier was killed, the office asked me to send her to the street to report?"
Dinozavre was able to avoid enemies
Firstly, he is a statue, even though it is a terrible threat.
Researchers said that the first found residues of an incredible Âa size of the canadian shotter were so well maintained that experts called "My Lisa in the dinosaures".
It was so well that they had even smoke to determine that the color of his chessed skin was red-corn - and said that he had, in some kinds, “the dark past”.
In the report recorded in the modern biology magazine, it was described as “the very well-contained from Tyreofor for the whole history of income and one of the best billion of dinosaures in the world”.
This is a recently discovered example of nodosaur living in the middle of the milk period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His undeserved kindness with the investigators who call him "truely noted".
This tragic tireofor is the most well-reserved species of such exhausted in the history of achieving articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Shawn Fancom when he entered the Millennium company of Sancor near Fort-Murrey in North Albert, Canada, 21 March 2011.
He looked at something that seemed different from the surrounding nature and decided to look out more.
The discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrelov Paleontologic Museum.
The following six years were worked to find animals within the earthly depth of 2500 feet (1100 kg).
Now that all this hard work is done, the end of the result can be demonstrated.
“It's just easy to stumble, and you can probably believe that he's sleeping”, said the leader author Caleb Brown, the Scientist of the King Tyrell’s Paleontolog of the Museum in which the creation is demonstrated.
“He will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-reserved dinozavor exemplars of Mona Lisa among dinosaures.”
By studying his skin, researchers discovered that it was grass, despite that it was covered by a pancir and remembered the walking dance, apparently, has been a significant risk of carcinogenic dinozavires.
This covered potential dinozaver showed a red white rock to be taken from the winds, and applied the protective technology as a protective box, which also uses many animals today.
This would allow him to go quickly with the surrounding and avoid meetings with the agamas, as experts assume that more dynamics have been held on him.
This was a wide range of 110 million years of age in relation to the family of nodosawars in May, and it is now on the exhibition in the King Tyrelov Paleontolog Museum.
The students have already studied the animal and gave him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the Music Laborant Mark Mitchell, one of the participants of the group who had spent more than 7000 hours for his disruption.
The incredible conservation of the exemplary allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of learned to document the picture and form of cheese and pancill plastes on his body.
They discovered the protective coverage, extended method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that it was the darkest of its below.
Although the protective cover and well-displayed, opening has become unexpected, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than the size of current animals with the protection of the coast.
It may be imagined that this dynamic has been so active about the flesh's dynamics that evolution has preferred the concentration mask as a way of survival.
But the majority of modern animals with protective coasts, such as olive, zebras or brunes, are significantly less sized and I are more accessible, which testifies that nodose has been seriously to survive.
"The serious threat of the massive, covered potential dinozaver shows how dangerous the dinozavirs of the Mileny period have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic associations in the cheese dinosaure also shows that its skin should have been red-core.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including the contents of its food tract, to find out that he was eating during his last table.
They believe that when the dinozaver died, he fell into the river and was brought into the sea, where he was thrown down and bounded down on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Albert was so heavy as now on the south of Florida, and the rivers and the ocean, most likely, were spread much more deeply than now.
"This nodozaver is truly noticed that it will cover completely the covered cheese skin, and at the same time he has been fully maintained in three dimensions, keeping a significant form of animals," said Brown.
“The animal is now looking almost like it looked at the rain's middle period.
It is not especially necessary to escape to rebuild it, just to be easily stuck, and you can probably believe that he is sleeping."
Meal period is the time when gygantic terrorists, the flesh’s dinozavirs standing on two feet were shiped on the earth.
Although the most wonderful of them, the tirannozaver rex, lived for millions of years later than Borealopelta, on the tireofore, was able to take place some of his terrible prejudices.
Their number includes acrocantosaure, a monster of 38 feet (11,5 m) weight at six tonnes.
Students whose last openings are opened in the modern biology magazine believe that Borealopelta has been introduced into the sea and mumitics in the hall after death.
The existence was found by Shawn Fancom when he worked at the Millennium Shach near Fort-Murrey in North Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to Museum's reports, it's the best tireofor in the world, together with the skin and the pancir, and it's the goal, from the morning to the bullets.
In the middle of these, they reached about 18 meters (5 meters) in length and weighted up to 3000 pounds (1300 pounds).
Their characteristics were two twenty-five ships from the bottom.
Researchers believe that this tragic tireofor has severely seemed to be now Canadian until the river has brought it into the open sea.
But the subwater conservation of the dinosaur has kept its paint with precision to the smallest details.
The rocking remains of this specific exemplary were so well maintained that the rest of the skin until these pounds covered the bulgarist pancills around the dinozau.
As Michael Greschko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, the degree of conservation is “sound as you win in the lottery”.
As long as I look at him, he's more vulnerable.
The stone residues of the skin to these pounds cover the bulgarist pancills that cover the animal’s chest.
His right front foot, you're thrown down, five fingers on it.
I can calculate the chess on it."
Mihailu SaaVili has been able to go to Poland without documents
Michael Saa’vili, who was previously headed by Greece, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, went to Poland.
He did this without documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
Saaville reports the police from the Televizja Republic, which has placed on its channel in YouTube with its statement.
Saavili expressed operations in the 1944 anniversary of the Barshaw Resurrection against Hitler Armies.
Since policy doesn't know the Poland, although he tried to start talking in this language, he had to speak English through the French translator.
During its statement, the political issue of Greece's cooperation with Poland was addressed, as well as about Ukraine.
The fact that Ukraine's migration service left his citizenship, the general policy was recognized in the United States.
How exactly he could make a transatlantic transport without documents until it was.

Consequences for Wainzicher and Olhovica have been extended until January
The time of the preliminary follow-up of the company's owner's group of Renova's Alhohoholdic and the head of the "T Plus" Boris Vainzicher was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Court of Basman was discussed as a question of the prolongation of the accused household arrest.
The representative of the CC at the meeting reported the decision to extend the time of the preliminary follow-up last time.
"Personal complexity and duration of the consequences have been determined by the need for exemption and experience of large numbers of documents, as well as the follow-up procedures on the territory of several RF subjects," stated the tracks.
He added that the suspicious rules were given to the Commission's leadership.
Their total size is estimated at least of the rubbles.
According to this follow-up, Vainzicher, Olhovik, as well as the former FAO "Come Energy Systems" Michail Slobodin, who was headed to the Wimpelkom company by 5 September, was transferred to the Commission the highest official offices for the establishment of maximum eligible tariffs for the heat and electricity and for the creation of favourable business.

How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Who are the streets?”
On 9 August 2014, Britain Ferrell was deeply deep.
Only day after the arrival to New York, the tourist was sitting on the bed of St. Louis at Airbnb.
She's getting a post to someone from the middle school.
There was said, "The police have just killed the eighteen-year-old child, and he is still in the midst of the street."
Taking note of that no one of her bands had acquired this information, she was charged, she closed the Facebook and opened the Twitter.
There was a lot of users in her source with no @TheePharoah.
The Reper from the Great St. Louis in real time celebrated in your officer the death of Michael Brown, an unwarmed black eighty-year growth, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He replied the graph of Braun's unleavened body, spread between the street, where it will be four hours.
"This is the wildness," she thought.
But death wasn't something new for her and her circle.
She left the phone, and later the night she returned to the tvs about that people were gathering to Canfield Drive.
There were scriptures of the signal band and claiming people and man who claimed that he was the father of Brown, who claimed: "The policeman from Ferguson just killed my unwarmed son."
It considers the first translation as the police officer stands before a group of protesters with a loud dog.
On another video, the other policeman, - she was, he drew up a bullet and said, "I will kill you all... animals."
“This is a non-standard situation”, according to its own memories, said Ferrell.
"This is not a murder like those to whom we used and which we could call typicals.
At that moment, I felt a genuine feeling.
And I was wounded and wept."
She took a bilingue to return and fled home on the day.
On 11th evening, she took her six-year daughter from her father's home and decided that they would both go to Ferguson for the morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in nearly three years, became the theme of the new "Who are the streets?" documented on the screen on 11 August.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and endurance from the view of people who are in the community and fill the street, required of responses.
Until Ferrell went to Ferguson with a daughter who was clothed in a bloom and a wheat under a color, they remembered the number of times before this morning, "on the black and their position."
She recalls how she said: “Remember how I told you how the black people were to be done for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because the policeman killed a eighty-year-old boy, and it was wrong."
"I couldn't take her," said Ferrell later.
"What happens today is the culture of what happened before.
She must know about it, see it, and learn about it.
It should not only be well understood in the activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of black and their situations and what we should do to be free to be free.
Even if I can provide her environment where she doesn't personally touch herself with a clear racism, she doesn't distinguish anything from any other black girl.
I feel that I would have been a bad service for her if I would have dismissed her."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made the first residence at South Florence Road, on the area that was divided by a police party that had made something like a palace camp until the activists waited for reports on the conclusion of the offence of the officer Darren Wilson
There, Ferrell and his daughter were joined to the company who had prepared the packaging packages.
They collected packages and helped to deliver them to the protesters.
At least, Ferrell was a new type of activism.
“My activism has been completely changed after 9 August,” she noted that as a student of the University of Missouri-St-Luis, she was the President of the Association of Health Students, representatives of national minorities, and was a sustainable justice and inequality in the field of health among black communities.
"I had no experience of an organizer.
That's the same thing."
For a few weeks at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of his companions.
Follayan said she and her main operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer were simply trying to document the events.
Ferrell asked: "Do you want to document or try to find a story on which you can play?"
This skepticism was added to many, often white people who came into the community with a view to the benefit of his pain and endurance.
“We have heard that the votes of people who were born and grown in Ferguson were not in the centre of attention, and they wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan has already been associated with his co-register Damon Davis, an artist, who has been active in the matters convicted to the penalty.
His participation was a sympathy to the project in Ferrell and six still residents with which the draft “Who are the streets?” supported for years after the murder of Brown.
"In this documentary movie nobody talks about us or with us, we're talking ourselves," said Davis.
"This was the most important for me as these people will be presented, because it is what I will imagine."
Although the draft purpose was not to focus on Ferrell's office, it was to show that the movement “is not about the salvator leader, but about how the community is joined”, as the Follaian said, was the most open of the film participants.
As a result of the "Who's Streets?", it is unexpectedly different to Ferrell's life, for example, how she loved her wife and concluded her marriage.
“I felt hungry”, said Ferrell, with a smile to tell how the prepared product was seen first.
"But I realized that when you do this and make the black, it must be a few levels of vulnerability."
Moreover, the history of Ferrell reexamines and focuses on the role of black homosexual women in the larger context of the "The life of black people is important".
Two of the three movement founders are those who have created the #BlackLivesMatter tag in networks after the killing of the black growth of Treyvon Mar in 2012 - are computing with homosexuals.
"Chermosexual homosexual women are supporting all this movement," says Ferrell. "And all because we continue to fight in several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to take all this burden."
Follayan agreed with this in the Property, noted that “the movement is actually supported by black women and homosexual black women”.
However, it states that “This is not a case of discrimination” and that Ferrell has not been chosen by central persons because of its different characteristics.
"He was a man who was awakening this energy," she said.
“ On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that it's on the first basis, because when ”
It may feel its energy through the screen."
At the same time, there is no longer a filmcamer in Ferguson, but there are complicated racial relations between the community and the half.
Ferrell will be more than two and a half years for the extent of the exhibition of the sex during the demonstration.
It describes the political atmosphere of the place that is called a house, simply "Bardak".
She's still holding for her age that she learned when she went out to Ferguson's street for three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two Salvador footballists discovalified for the rats of the United States players
Hunri Romero and Darwin Seren have received detailed discourses for unportuous behavior.
During the quarter-final catch of the Gold Cube of the North and Central America Football Confederations and the Caribbean (KONKAF) the Salvadors have disappointed American players.
First of all, Henry Romero's protector.
The Salvador shot Josie Altidor's attack, and then cut him off.
Then Seren's half-defense, when the coal was delivered in his craft area, made the U.S. Omar Gonsales protector.
As a result of Romero, he was disqualified on three bags, and Seren is six.
The same meeting has been completed by the American winning accounts 2:0. Goal.com.
Equality regeneration: Artist creates portraits using DNA Chalsy Manning
In the center of the Gallery of Fridman in New York, with the street of the swimming, people are white, black and green, everything is increasingly like each other.
These 30 portrets were created by Heather Duy-Harbourg Artist from the bottles of the bottles and of the hairs sent to her Chalsy Manning.
Manining has sent a circuit from Fort Levenworth, where the former investigation analysis takes 35-year-old period of transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition of 2 August is called "Equality Review".
This is the result of a double-year transscription between Dui-Harbourg, whose experience units technology, inflation and experience, and Maning, a woman-transexual and a designated director whose Barak Obama had mixed the court for three days before its presidentship.
Analyzing the DNA computer program received by Maning and suggesting it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons who could have such a gene, Dui-Harbourg created a depth, although it is not easy to accept a mannifest, which is not only a plastic DNA, in different ways of their interpretation and inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also the understanding of identity.
Maning, who was born by Bradley Edward, but from adult age, openly said that it was considered a woman in 2013, was sentenced by 20 episodes, including six instructions of the Act on spionage, computer power and heating.
Her graphs were not available, so it was only one of her graphs: a black-white seal, on which Manning was in a white piece of park, which seemed to be inappropriate, sitting behind the car's role; with this graph of it and becoming associated.
In 2015, Dui Harbourg completed its 2012 "Vision of strangers".
In it, the artist created portraits of non-personal by means of the courts of the species of cocktails and of the railways, dealing out of this DNA mushroom and creating pictures of how these people could look.
And then she received a letter from Paper Magazine.
"They took a interview at Chalse Menning and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dui-Hagbourg on a preliminary show of a new exhibition for the press.
At that time, Chelsea was visiting and graphing, so they joined her and asked whether she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In such a way, the artist and the Museum sitting in the Museum became friends of the transscription and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote the book of the Comics "Pleased Images", illustrated by Shaili Canundo, which has imagined how the Chals might be punished in the future and that would be able to visit the exhibition.
The fact that Obama really decided to free Maning for a few days after the outcome of the book in the light was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in the military campaign in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is now opened when Donald Trump announces the war of people who discover secret information in the Government, and gains new ways to burn in your enemy.
When Dui-Harbourg asked about the coincidence of this all over time, she said, "It's not going to happen."
In the statement of the artist written on the wall of the galerie, a huge signature of Manning below (with a heartfelt point above "i" in its family) calls to end "auto-division based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side, its mito-Handrian DNA, a long rubber of the C, G and A stated corn.
Including 200 letters (or nuclears, as scientifically expressed artist), Dwi-Harbourg hoped to show how we all were wonderfully like, in any case by our biological structure.
"I hope to explain people that our gene does not determine what we are to be open for the interpretation of genetic data and how susceptible it is," said Dui-Harbourg; its video in 2007, "Low Reminders" is also presented here.
"Data DNA can tell us many different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
After a part of the exposure placed in one comma, it's the top of the comics.
Maning in the style of King-Konga appears over the United States Rights Casar with a voice speaker in hand.
"If they kill your word, they will win," it is written there.
"It's why you're never gonna do it."
"This is the first quota of the letter she wrote to me," says the artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I've still got the skin moods when I'm talking about it."
Manining has not yet seen a personal exhibition - as it was prospectively pictured in comics - but when it is at -- it will welcome her masks in the middle of the comma, its own geno-simulators gathered, like a lot of protestants.
It is also made, as all in the exhibition to the height (5"2, Maning Creation), on which genetical gap groups were drawn.
"Before I'd cut them on the walls, but now I'd like them to look like a crowd of people," says Dui-Harbourg on portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea as a move that was standing behind her freedom."
Professor of the North-West University and Oxford University seeks a police in charge of murder
The police report reports that the national area of the Professor of the North West University and of the University of Oxford, which are looking for as a suspicious for the fact that in Chicago, a person's number was killed.

Russian Vicepremier Mutko: "We will perform the need for the WADA road card in the nearest time"
The Russian Vicepremier Vitalius Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Pinding Agency (WADA) established for the renewal of the Russian Anti-Document Agency (RUSADA) will be fulfilled at the next time.
"A specified stage in the implementation of the requirements was carried out, RUSAD had the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (Antidopinal Agency of the United Kingdom).
The VADA card was updated accordingly," said Mutko on Thursday.

According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could be difficult for Russia.
"All was declared, everything will be done.
The results will be submitted to the International Olympics Committee (MOC) and WADA at the next time," he added.
However, one of the requests included in the list underlines that Russian anti-pension structures should be publicly recognised by the results of the WADA order for the investigation of the Canadian Justice Richardharen, in which it was approved that the intervention in Russia was controlled by the State.
In question, Mutko said, "We are investigating, since our anti-dopen system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there was no gentlemen, and we will not recognize what wasn't happening."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smirnov, chapter of the Russian independent public anti-pension Commission.
On the same day, in the Russian Interview, Smirnov recognised the previous situation of the Russian anti-dopen structures, but added: "We repeatedly said that the report contains certain responsible positions and positions.
No one will accept this report without prejudice," added Smirn.
WADA removed RUSAD from the marketing control in November 2015 after the pending scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate the test under the monitoring of experts and the British Antidope Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the Moscow Office in July, the Director-General VADA Olivie Niggle said that RUSADA would " move in the right direction" to restore his work.

In October, it would be possible to pay a bank card to the ecaterinburg metropolitan, stated the OAO "I-Net" Officer Paul Vedernik in the "Obblist Journal" interview.

Starta, which will help your company not to become the "Uber"
Amy Erre wanted to evaluate the level of satisfaction among its startup in the field of electronic trade, but the issues did not work.
The answers often were disappointed, deceived, or worse, unexpected.
And even though she promised anonymity, some did not trust this process.
“He has never been successful and objective”, race ́ Erre ́, managing a 75 persons in San Francisco from Madison Reed's Electronic Trade in the field of access to hair.
Therefore, she turned to the third of its help.
There is now a new form of startups in the field of work with the staff that helps companies to find out how they feel.
By developing and licensing a programming security designed by a measurement in the event of the Companies, they allow companies to make expressions, to refer to certain teams and demographic groups, to anonimity and heat line for complaints, and in some cases to allow the operators to minimise the top management and to address directly.
"Now we have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, Soons, and Glint's start-up from Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used to measure the ability of the company.
Erreous race, which has achieved more understanding than they think and feel it in three years of use of Glint.
In addition to the experimental enquiries and enquiries of certain teams, the product has a warm map of the company and shows in a supervisory manner which has more complaints and whose managers have a low approval review that allows her to understand why.
Companies are wisely aware that they need to control the situation on the slave, Otherwise they will be the ‘Uber’, which has been interrupted in the scandal when the former post was posted in the blog in which the aggressive situation was described in which those who expressed disabilities were commanded.
For startups such as Glint, it is the desire to control the situation - the opportunity for the arrival of business.
By evaluation of the Internet port “Let us talk about payment”, dedicated financial technologies, global management, regulation and coverage industry may be more than 118,7 billion dollars until 2020.
The Convercent start from Denver, Colorado, who helps companies to prevent and discover bad behavior, noted a small increase in interest and activity in the previous year on the Ubera reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including ‘Airbnb’, ‘Microsoft’ and ‘Tesla’.
Recently, "Uber".
Like Glint, the Convercent allows companies to send a person's demand for a personal opinion, to collect the confidence of responses in real time and to watch the heat cards of the problem areas.
It also provides a warm line for anonymous text communications that allows them to report wrong conduct.
And if the top manager gets in, the complaints go directly to the direction.
“The Court of Public opinion has overcome the authority of the In­Ors”, said Patrick Quinlan, the foundation and the president of the Company Convercent.
If it is clear that the company is wrong with or does not have a negative effect, even if the inevitative is not limited, the company may have the valuable consequences in the form of customers, from the provinces and from the courts, Kwinlan reported.
"Ruby Tuesday", the network of restaurants, where over 25,000 inhibitors worked, was a convergence for more than a year to make sure that the rules and procedures were in the course of the company's office and to offer a simple way to return to the company's office.
Earlier, if you wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for the phone number or email of the office, to give an official complaint and to hope that it would be serious.
It was often a terrible and unfair experience, reported James Vitrano, leader of the Ruby Tuesday Company's administration, who said that it was not a normal way to follow complaints.
Now, when the company uses the Convercent service, the problems which have been hidden before from Office managers in other cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment and injustice of work, can be found and taken quickly.
"I can draw close to the comprehensive, comprehensiveness of the situation," said Vitrano, who will run by the Ruby Tuesday network management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from court-making proceedings."
According to Queenland, the companies began to be more serious to the ethics, values and in 2002, after Arthur Anderssen's accounting company had suffered from the cause of ethical distortions in the result of ‘D’ Enron’.
But only when the "networks societies have received mass distribution", companies realized that they couldn't keep their illness from the virus distribution in the network.
"Before starting and using technology to control the ethical people, it's hope as a person," he said.
And Glint, and Convercent are their programming as a service, taking with regular companies for their products.
This is the business model and the possibility of approving the venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, the convergence has received 10 million dollars from the company such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which resulted in the total capital of the company in 47 million dollars.
“Glint” received 10 million dollars in November from the Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in the total capital of the company with 60 million dollars.
These investments are worth wonderful if they participate in the interrelated nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of studies shows that today's stakeholders expect more of their slaves than before.
On the markets with cruel competition, such as the Silicon valley, high for the interesting and projects, it is only a minimum.
Co-operators want to feel that they accept and appreciate and that they dedicate their time to the company with a local mission.
“When people are happy to work in the company, they feel that they are hearing and that their work results, they are more trying to make such a successful company”, says Nina·quain, the vice-president of global loans and satisfaction in the LinkedIn company, where they are used, and ‘Convercent’, and ‘Glint’.
Investors receive income when businesses from their portfolio go well; businesses go well when they are loyal and invoiced.
If the third party's analytical instruments promise to increase loyalty and exercise, it is not surprised that they are supported.
As specialists are approved in slave areas, it is important to provide information on the development of the workshops.
But the devil data are until the winners of the company will take measures.
In fact, if the company asks for a repeated connection, it can make an impression that changes are serious.
And if changes are not quick enough, or they do not make it anywhere, it can develop disappointment, and the interests will lose.
"If you are going to ask for 4000 proposals, you must be ready to conduct 4000 discussions," says Russell Rat, President of consultation in the Cotter International Management Agency, who had to see how the companies make a mistake with the confidence in the data collection.
"Why, if you do not come to the end, they will say, "You have heard me?
You don't care about it?
And if you do, why should I not be equal?'
According to Erre, the Madison Reed company, who is currently conducting monthly issues, is able to take measures on the same day when someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after recovery of responsibility, lack of decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several orders in the areas of the company and introduce communication training in order to resolve problems.
The Ruby Tuesday company receives new knowledge of its own ability and hopes that these knowledge will help her to maintain more effectively in adults, highly running frames.
"If you are not old to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose clients, you lose the company.
In Barnaul, new asfalt on the Cross Army is covered
In Barnaul, the cardinal measure was adopted to eliminate the cause of asfalt falling on the Crossarmea.
The place where the twice came up on a recently disfellowshipped part of the Juvenile Street, it was decided to "hide".

This is reported on the official site of the country.
The Board of Briins is to work longer because the National Student Association has cancelled training twice a day
The time comes to the eleventh dinner; the multitude of footballists from the California University in Los Angeles is detained to talk to the new training fields of the campus.
Of them, with their footballs, discovered the bridges from the pool after the first day of the pressed camp.
For many players of the team, these minutes are a break in the middle of the day.
The players recorded for aeroplane will be sent back after three-hour training to prepare for final tests and will return to the Football Centre of Vasserman at 6:30.
Before the Monday turned to Thursday, the trainer of the team Bridge Jim Mora said, "In three days, these guys are waiting for meat."
The fact that the National Student Association has cancelled training twice a day, which was intended to reduce the charge for players, has actually decreased their slaves day – at least before the trials were made on Friday.
Thus, the beginning of the first three trainings of the Californian University in Los Angeles was appointed at 7:15 a.m. to move them into and without that fleshly design of players.
The effect of the lack of two trains per day has been more than one training day, and Bridge moves to the beginning of the camp nearly a week in comparison with the last year and conducts training during the age school for the first six seasons of the sea in Vestuda.
According to the schedule, they should be conducted 18 trainings to 20 August, including before starting an official preparation for the first game in the season against the Teacher University of A&M in September.
Mora said that it supported the amendment of rules by the National Studential Association, despite that it had another item in the player's carrying out.
"In three or four days we give them this great burden, this is a serious trial," said the More.
"And they simply changed it, they worked, they noticed the guys.
I think when we live until the Sabbath and we have more time, it will really be good."
When the camp ends, the Californian University in Los Angeles will make training closed; it is an unclean task, since its field is directly visible with the next park and from the neighborhood Laxin-A'a, a dear hotel, who has already been bombarded with football swords that are overcoming the protective network behind the doors.
Brian's players must take the apartment at the beginning of these outcomes, but the Sea admits that when the comats are free during the season, the problem may occur.
"We will have protection," said Mora.
"This is a serious problem, and I don't enhance the danger, assuming that someone can take a comma, sit there and write a video training.
If you have a video record of training, it's very serious.
But we'll have protection there, and we'll be protected at the parking number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna be too worried about that.
We have a plan."

Facebook strengthens the fact-cheking in combating fake news
Facebook will often send texts, doubt to the most independent experts, and show their conclusions under the original stages, stated the greatest world network on Thursday, which is trying to take place with the so-called fake news.
In the statement on its website, the company claimed that it started and used improved machine training algorithms to recognize the →sts, send them to check and may be shown the results of the fact-cheking under the original afternoon.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways of spreading the so-called fake news, which, in view of many, have been influenced by the presidential elections in the United States.
This issue is also actively debated in the context of the fact that French electors have been invoked in false messages before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the elections of September, they have declared to support the plan to broadcast networks if they would not operately remove posts that burn hatred.
On Thursday, in German statement Facebook reported the test of the new chemical algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Besides seeing what messages are exposed to independent checkers, people want to have a larger context in order to bring reasonable judgments on what they read and what they share," wrote Sarah Sue, the Facebook source manager in their blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "related articles" and work on other changes in the news source to solve the problem of fake news.
Create Roman Comic: One lock in English history
In the past, Scotney's lock was recorded in the "Sque" video, and in the 70s and 80s, he served as a place for Margaret Tetcher.
But 700 years ago from his lucky place in the River Bowl valley in Kent's town, he watched the worm story around, and now he inspired Jamie Rods, a Yorker with a coped hair and with a decline to historical documents, to Roman Comics.
"I am, it's so beautiful -- looking at the point of a man who died 300 years ago," he's saying with an excitement.
"You feel it so personally when you hold it in your hand."
"Lock in England" includes the period from the average century to the Evardian epoch and tells about the families living in Scotney; each history of the young British artists -- Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not the first book of Rods, which is on →date: In 2014 he wrote "The Dead Man's Zhube and other stories" - a assembly on the materials of the British Library; this project was unexpectedly drawn to the depth of the soul.
"I could just put a fingerprint on the part of the letter written in 1700 by a double agent working on cocobits," he said.
"This is his fingerprint."
And the letters will always be smokeed because the fire was burned at that time.
And after 300 years, in the future, you're there too.
Oh, how I like the archives!"
For a person who is encouraged to the old papers, receive support from the National Fund and the English Experience Council and live in the four-month lock ("Freely I've been a little stuck there") to be too good to be the truth.
Rods studied the "new" victorian lock all days, walked through the archives and considered a number of stocks and old things -- for example, the gien on walls or bottles, the centuries of the roof.
He walked through the park and the devastating of the old lock, talked to the forests, gardens, and sometimes with artists who worked on the illustrations to his book.
Then the night he'd drink whisky and sit down to write.
The story of Scotney's closure has not been very studied because the National Fund has received full access to it only in 2006 when she died after her inheritance, Elizabeth Hassi.
When Rods came there for ten years, they just started to talk to the →vive, which he described as "the aristocrats had gone on the rock for centuries."
Journals, a letter of the British Empire's time, cards, which had what he had, "You think the landscape of the confusions are crazy," says Rods, but this is why two families were baptized.
That's right, guys."
In some stories, the lock collector has been sent to a larger search in the English history: for example, in the Workshop, the hero comes from the building lock to join the Christian Revolution of 1381.
"There are information about the rebellion that occurred in 1380, in the book "Kenta and Sassex's Ricers," says Rods.
"The Christian resurrection began in these places, and I thought that the rebellion was the right beginning.
Maybe they were?"
Other surgeons are strong with the lock story, such as the "Sweetman" in which the Jezuite priest, whose family of Darrel had taken seven years during the English Resolution.
Or Contrabandist, contrabandinist in the XVIII century, Arthur Darrel, who, as they believe, was inscened by his own funeral, buying the grave with stones (that was discovered in several years when the grave was buried).
Darrelas are the favorite family of Rods of all the people of Scotty: "Jendlers, they were a perfect yellow, forever entered into and lost money for what they couldn't be allowed.
In various generations, men-Darrela resolved their problems with the spouse of rich elderly women -- I represent them as a company of good men who are able to take care of the inherents of great states."
After working in the lock, Rods will seek other opportunities to get a unique writer experience.
He lived two weeks in the finish mouse, where he wrote a graphical novell about Elamenmekaka, where he was a sanator at the beginning of the 20th century, and then he grew up again with the forest.
But Scotney's staying a place for him.
"I was cruel to go," he says.
"I felt like this: shit, I have to go back to real life."
Fifty major banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Russian Bank Association (ARB) is developed: after Sberban, BTB, ITB-24, Alpha-Banc, Gazprombank, Rosselhosbank, BNB and FC " Opening", seven other credit organizations will be going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be the part of the ARB organizations.
But this is not simply the outcome of all banks who claim to distort with the ARB, negotiations with another public organization, the united credit institution, the Association of the Regional Banks of the Russian Banks, which is addressed by the Anatoly Axak's policy, the President of the Committee on the Financial Market, recognised, at the last session, and the most effective enforcement of the opinion committee and the deputate on the number of projects prepared.
The beginning of the conflict inside the ARB was made in discussions in the Federation Council when new legislation projects were considered on the International Bank Council, in particular that provide a new group of banks depending on the sizes of the constitutional capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, stated that this draft legislation is adopted in the interests of the major banks that thus try to provide the possibilities of small and medium banks in the regions by capturing their customer.
Among other claims and criticism of the Centre Bank, which, in view of Tosunyana, does not always have the right to revoke licences in some banks, which, in fact, followed the expression of the representative of the CB: many rue-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-prostraphing banks, in particular, the External Prombanka, in the ruling of the ARB bodies.
Let us see that this exchange of opinions in a totally sensitive view with the main bank environment regulator and a visible conduct that the fifty major banks, declared non-associated with the ARB policies, began to be prepared to enter into the Association of the Russia, noted that "the effectiveness of the ARB work is at low level and that the active dialogue within the banking community is actually not implemented".
The bookmarks will be better
What's the matter going on?
Answer the main question that occurs in the smallest disaster or conflict in banks or nearly with it: the tabs will not threaten anything, rather, the confidence of the banking system will increase.
The "Russian" Anatoly Axakov, who has his abilities in all the interests of the banks and their customers, is a high level professional who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all leaders of the CB are present to annual association activities, and all significant regulatory initiatives are passed through the "regional" experts.
It is obviously not foreseen in the framework-organization plan.
Unfortunately, the ARB falls into a simple financial and administrative situation after such powerful and powerful participants with their contributions and lobby opportunities.
However, in this older institution, in 1991, there is a great potential to continue to comply with the bank legislation and the field of money-credit treatment in total.
Without saying that in the Russian association with the extended volumes, it is ready to accept any conditions of new members, judgeing on the response of its owner, Anatolia Axakov ("top too much) that on 21 July in the Press of the Parliament's newspaper, "the representatives of the banks out of the ARB have asked me to consider the potential of our "Russian Association."
Their proposals are to strengthen the vote of bankers in the Association Council and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
Now and in the negotiation process, the proposals of both parties are being examined, prepared for the programme of an external association of which was held in Sochi in the middle of September in the framework of the International Bank Force.
We'll be there.
Also, Anatolio Axak, underlined that "the stage is not holding", called the new runner of the updated Association "Russia" of the London Georgia, who leaves the postal of the Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, highly cared for its business and its qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Axak, who now relaxes in Crime, plans for one day to stop remission and come to Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association of Russia, where it is intended to consider the agenda of the Russian external neighbourhood.
Business cars with a busy engine in the major cities of Russia will not be carried out
The Chapter of Mintrans Nicolai Asaul stated that, despite the communications of the MMI, the cars with a gas motor to the major cities of Russia would not be taken.
It's more radical than our concept.
Our concept that the environmental class should be gradually increased.
And there's the concept of the meaning to go to zero emissions.
I think we're not technically ready to do this.
The question is, since what year?
That's the same thing at the level of the lozing phrase-- let's prohibit.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole town?

The legislative project will be discussed in two Congress palaces.
"This law will decrease poverty, increase the payment of billion dollars and make it as a change in the way the United States issues the capital cards to other countries.
The Law will reduce the warm mig and replace the scheme.
The new statement process provides the benefits of the candidates in the English, which have money resources that allow them to contain themselves, and the equipment to benefit from our economy,” said the Trump, the American SME.
Sex-work events are real, and this must be anxious for us.
We did not think that it could not be worse in 2017, a new report on the technological success in the production of sex works.
Yeah.
Sex jobs are now in the center of attention.
The Fund for Responsible Working Technology (FRR) has recently issued a report dedicated to sexual development in nearly 5-10 years.
According to Noel Charkee, the professional of the workshops and the experienced intellectual of the University of Shephild and FRR, we must be seriously addressed to their appearance.
They can choose the color of the robots' eyes, the shape of the sockets and the type of node.
"The people hide this way, but the companies have already been sent to consumers, and soon we will see them much more," she said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex-cuck evolution of their emotional colleagues in the robots of sylicon skin, heavy for the skin, and almost Âestic replicas that manages the experimental intellectual.
They can also "spend" their robots on their cuss by choosing everything from the color of the eye and the form of robots to the shape and the color of the foot.
But the fact that many robots have a "privilegity" compared to which Stepford Women would appear to be very progressive, it is still worried more.
Modern sex-bucks have become robots with silicon skin.
For example, the "RealBotix robots" company allows users to set the quality work they find an attractive, for example, intensity.
There are more sexworks of Roxxxy Gold, times "True Companion", which are set up with already programmed individuality - for example, "Culd Farra" produces a strong impression, and "Dicay Wendy" is a "small" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that matches yours," "True Companion reports carefully."
So she loves what you love, does not like what you do not love, and so much more.
It has changed its admonition during the day as the present man!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she can "be in a construction"!"
In the event of sexual work, there are many concerns - not lastly because they replace real relations - but the most concerns women ' s underlying form, association with violence, which causes the power of the Cold (reading) Faroe.
Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator on the True Companion site, only for men.
"If a woman has (sic!) may be a vibrator, why man can't have Roxxxy?" says on the website.
But these sex-works are not just feetches or just new sex games.
Their appearance and all increased complexity indicates something more dark and deep in our culture, to decline from the idea of gender-effectiveness to the desire of sex with an optional addiction.
The majority of men, of course, will not buy sex workers, and although FRR notes their popularity, they remain still in consumer culture.
But what happens to us from the periferia may be very learned about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are not foolish or aggressive until the free market will give them the opportunity.
This is not a coincidence - that these complex sex works appeared exactly when women's rights throughout the world were threatened when the white House is a president who praises what is right to women.
The most implied in the teleserial "Rasskaz of the servants" is not graphical images, shaded bodies and exhausted eyes, and it is exactly how visual it is.
The Response of Gilead is an overground, but now it's not so big.
The purpose of sexual work industry is to get such a physics of the likeness of real women (only with the proportions of the pornostars) that technology allows.
Their creators want people to look forward to the body's movement.
But exactly their "characters" robots are not like real women.
They can't fight with their partners or leave them.
They have no life or biography -- nothing that could indicate to independence or something else that could solve the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the servants.
Los Angeles Yugin (Puh) Jeter, a member of the United States of Ukraine since 2013, does not help our national team at the campionate of the basketball campaign, whose final part starts on 31 August.
This is what the General Manager reported in the BeBasket Portal's interview, Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to agree with Jeter, but, desirablely, he would not accept family conditions.
We'll go to a workshop without a natural player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will give the opportunity to develop our young players," he said.
At the time of Jeter's direct participation, the Ucraine's collection took the sixth place for herself on the worksquete-2013, and the first came on the basketball championates, where "yelto-black" could not overcome the group phase, and the U.S.'s wizard was put in the middle of the 15,4 points, making 3 elections and delivering 5 transfers.
Jeter stopped to speak for Ukraine's collection since he was coming from the center of our national team of Michael Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
Man's robasket-2017 proi in four countries at the same time: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team of its group tourists will lead to the Promised Earth.
The Muzzin group in the group B will have five individuals: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Greece (3th), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In the framework of the preparation for the tournament, our husband's collection conducted two control units in which the Netherlands and the whiterusses were reached.
The big treasure of the Trumpa?
Myth Romney's wholesome
At the time of the Trumpa, the fact that the political disputes made by the American electorate have disrupted some families in micro-level.
Among the Day of Thanksgiving and Birthday, the American newspapers have passed by how to cope with the terrible families voting for Tromp.
It seems we're all pressured soon as we're getting out.
It's less about the ability of the Trump to join the family.
I'm writing about this because my kitchen, the left view of the poetes from Chicago, who had been on the knifes with the restaurants in his family, came to me this week to New York.
She said to me that the commitment to the fight against the general agency could have a effect.
At the Trompe in the White House, all of which she knows, including the brother-respectant with which she has discussed the policy for decades, were immediately and strangely on one side.
Without the dinner, it is certainly good; but I can't think that in a larger context it may be a lot dangerous.
Trump inspired powers in the left floor, but the deforming effect of his government can move us all right.
When we talk about Trumpe and "Normalization", we mean a small chance that one time we will stop to hurt his outcomes.
There is, however, a more doubtful scenario in which the Trump "normalizes" the most right resistance, which will be unexpectedly shown in the background of its standards as a model of healthy sense.
I believed that I was very sorrowing today by the old-moded misunderstanding of Mitt Romney - with a dog on the car's cotton and a 14-percent accommodation tax (but at least we knew how it looks like his tax declaration) - compared to Thram , and the other, very small.
When the Trump whi, the Response candidate will be enough to be simply in his mind to see a great step in front of it.
When my kids went to the center, we went with the children to the Carusel in the Central Park, the biggest cowsel in the New York Park Department, and the best way in town to take three dollars if you don't need coffee.
The wounds are terrible and crushed, the images of the steady on the central barban - the crushing clowns and animals, which, as a result, are terriblely looking at the bridge - extremely bad, and the wounding, as not strange, leads to an obscure.
Such a lot of things are disappointed in this town: Arts of heavenly silver are stumbled, the powers of the consequences are too deceive, and the reality of the city doesn't succeed.
Thirty-five years ago, and I still worried on the day I learned that the area of Suiss-cattege is not actually a Swiss Shale (thematic "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage"), but a large cross-border in North London.
And the carusel in the Central Park is too an unusual, vulnerable place where two years a child, a child of eleven years and two women for forty can take a good time.
If I could put a coruseline, I would have put a five, but, for fortunately, no one asked me about it.
And at the University of this week, I was asked before making a terminal card, to evaluate my "experience" purchases on the scale from one to five stars.
In the coffee on the angle of my street, the same plus option to compare the tea with 15 percent is the order for a stand.
This is not only the neutral idea of interaction, but it is still necessary to put a personal attitude in the situation that it does not suppose.
The poor seller at the Universe was convulsively laughing until I was able to have my experience to introduce her credit card in five stars.
Oskar Pistorius translated from the hospital because of the pain in the breast
The architect leaves the guy for the visit to the doctor for the second time.
In the past year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of injuries to be treated as a result of the injury.
Pistorius was convicted for industrial murder after the prosecutor's appointment to the initial sentence for non-promotional murder.
He killed Steenkamp early morning the Holy Valen's Day in 2013, shot in it several times through the door of the toilet comma in her house in Pretoria.
Historius said he accepted his friend for the night war, hiding him in the bathroom.
The prosecutor claimed to give another protest, this time against the six-year-old Pretoriaus, which, accordingly, was too mixed.
The general prosecution stated that the claim to the Supreme Court of the Southern Court and the appointment would be considered in this year.
The time of Pretoriaus may be increased for 15 years if the prosecution is successful.
There is no penalty in Southern Republic.
A signature on unusual is chosen to be understood by the NTV journalist
The officers have chosen a measure of interruption in the form of signatures on unusualness for men who had attacked the NTV television journalist Nikita Disovera during the direct heating from the Horn 2 August park.
This reports TASS with the Official Representative of MVD RF Irin Volk.

In contrast, the designers were trying to keep the mosquito.
Two Bulgarian citizens were arrested in Greece for illegal palace
According to the report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens have been arrested in Greece for illegal palatisation.
On 1 August, a group of people was arrested in Sitonia, set a palace in a non-placed hold, including two Bulgarian citizens.

The tests will be carried out during the entire season.
According to the Ministerial District, the court may designate a straf.
Russia's IMI accused the Vice-President of the United States in the time of the "Calde War"
The statements made in the Hodepea tour of the Vice-President of the United States Michael Penses were criticized by the Russian IMI.
"Don't lamentate that Washington is deeper to the primary idealized prints of the " cold war" time, which are completely dismissed from reality," says the Russian External Political Affairs.
Thus, in the Middle Ireland, the Pennsylvania's words on the " Russian threat" and the trials for the interruption of the border mentioned in the Subgorce.
The Russian Middle Middle East indicated the dignity of " or with Western, or Russia" election and the invisibleness of the tissue as an alternative income of the entire South-Eastern Eastern ' s NATO.
The Russian diplomats also claimed that the United States had violated the international law by applying the power to decline Kosovo from Serbia and thus establishing another point of pressure.
"We call the American colleagues to stop ruling Russia and its external line, which is increasingly based on respect for partners and preparation for the joint co-activity, in the mutual learning of interests," states the Russian Middle Middle Declaration.

It is also established that a woman has three other minor children.
As mentioned in the chapter, the family’s view of the right-guardians did not fall before and did not stand on the education.
Police has now been established by the circumstances and reasons offered by the woman to this action, after which the processing decision will be taken.
Now the young man is under the supervisory of the doctors.
As reported earlier, a 21-year-old woman in Nicolae has cast her child into the mushroom.
Grygory Leps: "I'm fighting, although 55 is not 30."
One of the most sustaining artists of the Russian Estrade Grigory Leps will release its 55-year-old artists on the next Sunday.
Before the complaint, the song communicated with the "Ecclesiastes" observator.
I'll remember how your "polytheist" was noted.
The special tent in the "Lujniks", Gloria Genior sang for the owner, a powerful salut over the Moscow River.
You're probably able to get your five-year-old.
The plans have gone?
If you talk about the profession, it was a successful period.
I worked a lot, three times passed with the guests throughout the country, gave 120-130 concerts per year.
I put two bad albums out.
Of course, now I'm not the one that we'll say 20 years ago.
The biological hours are not lying.
Sing as I sang at my 30, it becomes more hard.
However, I'm fighting, I don't want to stay.
And I'm with new people, I'm going on a different level.
You and the new album are recording with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, work on him now and now.
Actually, we've already recorded all in my study and we'll send him to Los Angeles.
It is called "Why are you so serious?" in a single song written together with You.
She's not still ready, so we've never trained her anywhere.
We'll do it later when we're taking a clip on it.
And the albums are in November to the series of my Jubilee concerts in the Moscow Crocus City Holle.
To your new plastic, a classic American shotman, Chris Coulman.
You wanted him to be in your gastrointestinal station?
I think, Coulman today is one of the most of the world's barbaners.
He came to my study, recorded his party.
I made him enter into my group, and Jeremy Colson (the barbarian who was involved in various projects. - "Report").
However, for continuous work in Russia, they had exhausted excessive conditions.
It was about honors from $35,000 to $45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-consult area I would find worth-worth-servants.
And he found a great boyfriend of Malishova.
It is better to eat.
Sometimes I want to get to someone of them, not for what.
For example, the gytarist Fedor Dosum is highly catched at international level.
Western magazines are written about it, invited to different gitaral features.
Steve Way, listening to his game, said "a new generation of guitars, with another executive technology."
Your album is coming to Los Angeles, the Americans are working with you, but you can't still come in the United States?
Are you trying to get this prohibition out?
Now, honestly, I don't do anything.
There are a number of institutions that are addressing this issue.
As a composer, I really am sorry that I can't go to America.
I never said I'd learn there.
How much more you're talking to these professionals, that's what you're talking about.
We're not stupid to them, but we don't have such experience, schools.
Before our executives of the population, 70 years of age, the tasks that the Americans have always decided have not been completed.
They tried to make a maximum quality learning.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, I'm going to go to the United Kingdom for ten years.
But I'm still going to give documents to the British Employment every year so that I may be allowed to go back there and the most important thing is to work there.
Others will be welcome to me.
And in August, you've been planning a concert in Monaco, not an order, but an affair, right?
Yeah, in Monte Carlo, there's a good sporting room, I've been there once.
Now they have been invited again, and, as I think, all the card billets have already been sold.
To Randeva Lima Waykule, starting on July 20, you're going to go?
She invited me, and I, of course, answered.
Laʹ is a wonderful song and a beautiful woman who can give itself and the wool, and even a shadow.
After the guests and jubilean concerts, as I know, you want to turn to the creation of the High Heavy Vladimir.
You already have two albums with his songs in the discography.
When's the third end?
Probably in the year.
But he's gonna be completely made differently.
I want to write the 80-90 higher song in the same way as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'm going to be a companion of our responsibility Timor Vedernic.
I'm trying to participate in the album and Alexander, Jacoblevich Rosenba.
I talked to him about this, we've got good, but he's a man busy, so we'll see how it's going to happen.
You and the songs of Boris Grabenchikov have gradually entered into your restaurant.
Maybe then you'll write the album of his thing?
Boris Borissovich is a man and a great man.
I've seen with him a few times and asked, "Shall I sing that or another song of him?
He said, "Grigor, I write songs that they may be fulfilled."
Please try, eat.
It's probably interesting to write this album.
Until I have no such task, but in the future, a year ago, if the Boris Borisovic is not going to express, I may make a project like this.
If you don't focus completely on your producer center.
I guess until you have done his potential yet, haven't you signed contracts with all artists you're interested in?
There's a number of artists I'd like to have under my wheel, but they're alone.
Are you under Sergei Lazarov?
Sherge is a brilliant song, I invited him.
I can't agree with his recipient, but he's professional and has its development.
And now in my center, there's Alexander of the Panaiotes, which I've brought to "Holos".
We've concluded an agreement and we're working.
In our pop music, such songs are often.
It will be sincerely sorry if he doesn't take the heights of which he is worth.
I'm trying to get him a recorder, I'm filming the clo.
I hope a good result.
I also try to move other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I cry for poets, sometimes their tracks fall in television and radiocanal rotation.
If they don't have great heights, I'll still bring our cooperation to the final log.
On the outside they'll get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they're going, they can go through their way, and I'm not going to force them to return their money.
Although I would be pleased if some of them had a commercial success and would pay me the percentages we agreed in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to get oxygen to anybody.
Let everyone work, run, prove how I've ever proved.
If tomorrow you're going to make a gastrointestinal tour in Ukraine and guarantee the travel in the country, you're going?
I'm invited to be there until these couples.
In the main way and in the case of closed activities.
And what's going on with a big tour...
I'm a man of my country, a Russian, who was in his own victory to Syria on the same plane that was destroyed.
If they say tomorrow that you have to fly to any other point in the State's interest, I'll be quiet.
And I'm worried about what bloggers think about me and other critics.
I am sincerely sorry that we had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and must be together.
I'm sorry if it's worth getting, at least in the nearest time.
And before I gave 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
We meet like nowhere.
Thank you very much.
And he cooperated with several Ukrainian artists: Annie Lorac, Saint Lobodoy, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, the mass of genuine people, and sincerely, they can't be able to do their talent for a wide Russian audience now.
Music must be united and distracted.
I would be pleased to invite some classic Ukrainian artist to Russia, such as Slav Vakarchuk, and have made a concert with him.
But I think it's a little likely...
Andrea Oblopkov was transferred with space
As "E", the Technical Director of the Eastern Andrew Oholopkov accessed to the Âge in the State Space to the Scientific and Production Centre (HCRC) Chronic.
Earlier, he was a de facto of building the east space, but it was translated to the Moscow Films, where the production coordination was taken by the Centre of Eastern and Eastern Operation.
Mr. Oglopkov's latter will not be: the post of the Technical Director, most likely, will be released and the functional officer will be dismissed by the CENCI.
The Technical Director of the Eastern and Subdirector of the CNCK on Technical Development of André Ochlopkov has passed to the GNPC named Chruničev, "E" has told the top managers of several industrial businesses and the Government's equipment.
"He's working on a new post a few weeks ago," the "E" meetings in adults.
The CENCI's operational comment on Thursday failed, and Mr. Ohopkov was not available for comments.
However, the "E" information was officially confirmed in the GDPC.
He decided to go to the position of the Director for the Coordination of Production, - stated undertakings. - André Ohlopkov has completed the task set before him for the first start of the East Space.
Mr. Ohlopkov passed to › › CENCI in 2013, having a service in Space Armies, especially in Baikonur, and in Plesque - at the " north" spacious post of the first commander in the name of the Colonel.
In 2009, Andrew Ohlopkov was the figurer of the voting case.
Consequently, he was accused of being accused of the consequences of the region: as if the commercents were received for the demands of mysteries, but did not comply with the commitments taken for the deployment of parts of the rachets in the Archangelian region and the Republic of the Commissary.
In 2012, the court of jury recognised it as innocent.
The responsibilities of technology development were extended to various projects, but most of them became the cosmodrome on the Next East.
The Federal Space, then held by the Oleg O Accessenko Agency in the " E" interview, directly said that the situation on the Eastern " was critical already in October 2013."
The fact was that when planning, an error was made: the end of the building and the execution of the first start of the Union-2.1 racket was planned at the same time, at the end of 2015.
For the end of the year, the establishment was decided at the mid-year and the time of December to July 2015.
In order to achieve the process, the CENCI specialists started to join parallel technology installation on non-building objects.
The main side of this idea was Andrew Ohlopkov.
Despite the risks that have occurred and still occurred (which was on December 2015 the Union only on 28 April 2016), this idea was justified, the source "E" on the spacedrome said, "If we would not have done any of these pounds from the East but would be able to build."
Vicepremier Dmitriy Rogozin, who was smoking the creation of space, called Andrea Oglopkov his "cosmic Susanami", but he had almost always requested information on the way of building.
Mr. Ohlopkov and directly: for example, in the interview of "E" he proposed to leave the Federal Federal Agency on the Special Construction (Specstruct) status of the only artist on the East and try to work with the subordinators, "Why should we all eggs be placed in one corner of Specstrous?"
This idea found support in the Government.
Since 2017, the CNCIA took the responsibility of the General Agency to allow the construction work on starting and technical complex planned in the fourth quarter.
According to the "E", Mr. Oglopkov's transfer to a new workplace was a distinction with the CNCI's leadership for the completion of space-completion and the methods of work with sub-additional responsibilities.
"It was decided that this would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers who participated in the East leadership.
The Government's partner, in its part, calls for strange decisions: "He was one of the best experts, it would not be easy to find an equivalent replacement to him."
It is not required: the position of the Technical Director of the Space will be cleaned and its functions will be dismissed by the CNCK.
The two-specific education programme is available in schools
In the future, the students of the Universal School will receive two specialities at the same time.
According to the director of the Department of Scientific and Education of Saint-Slaves Holubenko, it is possible to reread the repeated disciplines to the participants, and the question of the remuneration of the other jobs on the second speciality to resolve with special grants, " RIA News".
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to control, and we and the expert community have a mechanism that will allow two specialities to be enhanced, but at the same time will not be opposed to the next law of education in the field of education," said Golubenko.
On the past Friday, Vladimir Pu with the students of the Centre of Sirius, Mary Andrew, who had to pay repeated items for the second speciality of the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl race, learned by the class of a screw and fortepiano, has the reward of competition in both directions.
The Chapter of the State recognised her question very accurately and promised help.
In Me Impact for a 17-year-year-old Russian wall
A 17-year-old Russian Cyrill N., which is held on the wall of the high-country cover, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
Youngman, using two non-personal men, passed through a three-metric band to the territory of the Nestle Office Affairs and took himself to one of his bags.
He did not show any special delay, insurance, and insurance.
Young man's been arrested on the coat.
Co-operators of the Ministry of Public Security sent him to the ground on the top.
After that, he was sent to the National Migration Institute.
There are stated that youth is legally on the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, the video with a young man who was assembled at the highest became a population in the Internet.
The students called the young man-paw.
According to the MI, such experiments I'm going to be hobby for him.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to facilitate HCVs.
The red meat and chocolate are accepted to be a cosmar for your food tract.
However, recent studies relate to the reverse: the diet that is rich with meat and milk products can help to facilitate the symptoms of those who suffer inflammable illnesses.
This is an unexpected disease from which approximately 1,3 million people suffer in the United States and 300 000 in the United States, which is to the quantities and extinction of life, to the chronic or blood advantage, to the wheat and extremity.
Normally, in order to reduce symptoms of pain, they recommend avoiding meat and milk products, but researchers from the Washington University have established that the main aminocytote was three times aids to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the wallet.
The conducting studies of Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the wallet are monitored in order that the microbs of food do not be found in the body.
The cells that are able to start the process are equipped with cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and not with sensitive weights.
If the equality is too slow to the side of the burning, it may lead to the renewable diseases of the wallet.
Experiences showed that the muscles of a certain bacteria in the wallet have increased tolerance of cells.
And this bacteria needs three times -- one of the building elements was -- to start the presentation of these cells.
Professor Colona said, "We have established a relationship between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus re日i, which is a part of the normal microbium of the wallet, and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tripthotan contained in the mouse food, more they had these immune cells."
He suggested that the same would be to work in people: the composition of L. re日i and the rich three times of diet can contribute to more tolerant and less declined to the combustion of the environment in the wallet.
The post of Dr. Louis Servantes-Baraganvas, studying the diversity of increased tolerance of immune cells, discovered that one group of experienced muscles had these cells, and another group, which belonged to the same line, but contained, was not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbium of the mouse box, by the bacteria, virus and grapes, which would usually be in the iron-cooked track.
The DNA of the mouse wallet was secvened, and six kinds of bacteria were found with muscles with immune cells but with no mouse.
The muscles grown in the sterile environment with no good microbium and not developing this type of immune cells received L. re日i, and their immune cells appeared.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers developed L. re≤i in the middle and then transferred a small size of the hydrogen - without bacteria - to the non-evolved immune cells from the mouse.
Immune cells were converted into cells that increased tolerance.
When the active component was able to be stuck, it appeared to be a side-product of tripthotan, which is like an indol-3-millucic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tripthotan in the mouse food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tripthotan level was decreased two times, the number of cells also fell two times.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same higher tolerance of cells as the mouse, and most of us have L. reʹi in their yellow-coat track.
It is not possible whether side-products of tripthone from L. re日i to develop cells in humans as with muscles, but those who suffer from inflammable illnesses have been discovered in genes with tripto.
She says, "The development of these cells is likely to strengthen us, since these cells depend on the processes on the internal surface of the clipboard.
High levels of tripthotan in the case of L. re日i may lead to an increase in their population."

The Requisite for White House was charged by tax payers in thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces granted by the TIME magazine, the decision of the White House in the past month to take the sea pechot to the South Pool for the activities of the United States Industrial Production was worth payers of $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, which is like Marine One, when the board is president, is the central element held on July 17, in the White House of Agency, on which the American building programmes were demonstrated.
President Donald Tromp, Vice-President Mike Pens and high office of the White House have examined the technology products of all fifty states.
The vertebral produced in Connecute was made near the ice of Man, a fire car from Wisconsin and a car car from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Scadry of Sea Pechtolets (HMX-1), the Warrior Government of the White House was determined for the presence of the holiday in particular, or “FRAGO”, only 36 hours before the holiday arrived on the South Law in the case of “inhabited” activities.
"I just wanted you to be sure that you are in the course because this is an unusual wide range of business," wrote the commander HMX-1 in the electronic letter to his leader, the first head of the Marine Pechot Airport Aviation Aviation Aviation Corps, which has been threatened by business.
The letter indicated that the holiday would come to the South Lake at approximately 7 hours tomorrow 17 July to participate in the business appointed for 3 hours of the day and remain there before the airport was released between 6 and 9 dinner on the same day.
The letter adds that if sending out of the White House is detained, the second equipment will be required for the reverse aircraft in the time of work.
The first equipment was conducted by the holiday during the business, and the department protection remained close to the aircraft until it was on the ground.
The records received by the Time magazine remained unexpectedly if the second emission had been required.
The Hatcha Act prohibits federal servants and use public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 pointed out whether it would not be contrary to this establishment.
"In addition, we asked whether this was not the violation of the Hatch law, and we answered that it was not," wrote the commander.
"It seems you're going to go ahead," said the leader.
The ‘American’ business was announced by the White House as an official business, and the law of Hatcha was not extended on it.
But even in official activities there are political notes.
In the course of the Chairman's activities, he made efforts to continue the reform of the health care that was at the same time in the senate, and grasped the efforts to regulate governmental establishments.
Aerodrome, such as Marine One and Air Force One, for political purposes, is a new presentation.
The presidents are proposed to take them for travel.
But to ask them only for the interests of the ability.
Thrump has already been discussed in February when the Chairman's plan was on the backward during his first pre-elected midnight in Melbourne, Florida, and his account in your owner has been sentenced to the President's aircraft for the use of his preliminary aircraft.
“White House at the extent of the indication “Accepted in America”, which was represented from 50 states made by American slaves from American materials,” said the substitute of the white secretary of Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 teams often carry out training aircrafts around the Washington Aglomeration and on the South Lake, in order to enhance the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with precision to dju.
When Trump was at the G-20 in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training facilities at the White House.
According to one of the factors, the aircraft carried out for the "Accessed in America" operation was estimated to be equipped in the calculation of the road aircraft per month.
On that day, the departments were also held on 11 additional hours in the framework of " non-president tasks for support".
According to the White House, no expenditure for payers were made for any other expenditure.
The representative of the Company Sikorsky reported that the company did not participate in the organization of the shower on the South Lake.
HMX-1 does not take account of the budget on the presidential aircraft, and to determine the exact amount of the operation.
However, the 2017 fiscal year of the Ministry of Defence, the tax of the VH-3D Defence Defence Debt is 24 380 dollars per hour.
The department records confirmed that the time of the year was 30 minutes on each side of its aircraft based on the sea-based Quantiko aircraft in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real valuation of the use of the heat is very lower than this.
“To calculate the value for payers based on an example of refund rates, it is fairly wrong”, says Walters.
“These examples include personal contributions, service and many other unrestrainted costs, including annual assets.”
According to the investigation carried out in 2015 by the RED corporation, the refunds are not included in the value of the personal amount, but, in fact, consider the value of the fuel, services and expenditure set out in the Treaty.
At that time, the former press secretary of the White House, Shawn Spizer, was designed to protect the use of the hole for business.
“The idea is to demonstrate the things made in America on this week” said Speiser.
"And I know that the Sikorsky and the Connequat company are very harmful by the fact that they contribute to national security, and what they think, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose worker place depends on it.
And I think as the majority of Americans, we all are fierce of this hole and other military technology, on which the creation of so many Americans has been unable to work.
That is why, of course, it is appropriate to focus on this."
It was unexpected that Trump interacted with the wheel, looking at the South Power during the business, but he was just sitting on the driver in the fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump returned to the representatives of the Sikorsky company, with pressure on the subject of its own float of products of the company.
"I know "Sikorsky", said the President. "I have three."
