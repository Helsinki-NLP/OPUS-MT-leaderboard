European inflation goes into food
The accelerated inflation, registered in the euro area, should first be the growth of the price of food products.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering - after 2.6 per cent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - announced the Union statistics office in Luxembourg.
Official previsions were only given as a 3 percent - the Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), in contrast to the North American, British and Canadian Property, did not cut the basic interest, under prejudice that the reduction, together with the prices increasing the primary materials and the reduction of the forced park, would cause an inflation respiratory.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least approximately two percent.
It is an analysis, the ECB is located in Trade 22: "True to negotiate" on the inflation so that it should not be involved in this subject.
The inflation of 3.3 per cent, registered in Germany, was baptized by the 12-year record; so in Spain increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
The inflation was shot into the euro area due to the galopant food and energy prices.
Cotisations at the end of the wheat increased in a 88 per cent and also the cotisation of the soja alcan’s maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, there was much more payment in 2007 for vegetable oil and milk products.
The price of crushed petroleum on the world market increased this year in 52 percent, reaching the black gold last month almost 100 dollars the barrile.
Inflation in 2008 will rise from 2,1 per cent of the current to 2,5 per cent, in turn for 2009, to 1.9.
The annual inflation shall be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months of approximately 3 per cent, however the average annual rate shall be of 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce the types of interest during 2008.
Gallup provides a governmental crisis
After a long time of this employment, for the beginning of December, the support of the Juvenile Democratic Association has increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, whereas Gallup has never experienced such a low level - 13 per cent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the secure electors of the parties - due to the greatest firmness of the opposite electors - would mean a support of more than two thirds (a 71 per cent) against the support of a fifth part for socialists (a 20 per cent).
The investigation, the Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats Aliance would not reach the limit necessary to have a parliamentary scene: its support within the entire population is of two per cent.
Among safe electors there is one percent of more sympathisants in both sides.
The economic environment has continued to be late even in comparison with the lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 per cent the proportion of those who have particularly judged the economic situation in the country, while another 46 per cent believes that the situation is very bad.
The family, after the most hopeful expectations of the early and soil, are now more pessimists in the change of their own economic situation.
As regards the next year, the majority of the population account for the deterioration of the situation and only one decade expects a improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, higher than any previous question of Gallup, believed that the President of the Government was more wrong than his functions.
13 per cent of the consultants trusts or trusts much in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 per cent of the consultants.
54 per cent of the population does not trust absolutely in the Government Chair and 27 per cent does not trust in the President of the Democracy Joven Aliance.
One of the indicators of the political situation's configuration is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the disadvantage experienced against the Governing Boss without a government change.
While after the disturbances of October last year, 35 per cent believed that it would be desirable to maintain in the power of the Government and Government, this proportion is currently only 20 per cent, so the relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the celebration of new elections.
The interest of the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60 per cent of the questioned answered that it would certainly participate, and another 20 percent said that it would be involved.
In comparative manner, in "a general election to celebrate this Sunday" only 55 per cent of the population and another 15 per cent believes their participation. On the basis of the current intentions of the electors, there is no doubt of the result of the popular consultation.
A 74 per cent of the population would disapprove the payment of studies rights, a 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of hospital attention.
If we observe these proportions only among the insured participants in the reference, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of electors would be the introduction of studies rights, the payment for medical consultations and hospital attention.
The most dear is Auchan, the Tesco has fifted its prices
The average increase in the price level of a 16 per cent of the hypermarketes of Budaörs' gold triangle, with the difference that the IVA has not increased this year.
Article of Napi Gazdaság
This year has also increased in a average of 16 per cent in Budaörs’ commercial gold triangle the usual ship canastal of the Napi journal, but in all the hypermarkets a growth has been very higher than the thousand HUF.
As in December of the past year prices had already been "dispared" in the supermarkets of food, there was no drastic carriage in comparison with the high playing point.
However, it is obviously terrible for consumers that what they had been able to buy a very lower price under the nine thousand HUF today, they cannot do it for ten thousand today.
The Napi canaster in the studied hypermarkets exceeded at least 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest rate was 10 573 HUF.
(In 2003, this canastal covered 6800 HUF.)
The price of the Unicum licor and fisheries was nearly held at the level of the previous year, but a strong increase was registered in the powder, noise and amacola seed.
The price of wheat and bread followed the data of the Central Statistics Office, although in Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the product price by less than 200 HUF.
Similarly, it was amazing in this tent that the price of the Coca-Cola with a redimable bottle of two litres was less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, costed only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, in the Napi Auchan canaster was the best face, as Cora the most beautiful.
Our estimates, regardless of the prices of the Christmas last year, Cora increased with a 15, as Tesco and Auchan with approximately 18 per cent of the prices in the Napi Canastal.
Comparing the values of the canaster in the past year with the smallest canaster of this year, the difference was a 12 per cent, so the growth between the smallest of the last year and the face of this year was 21 per cent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
The average price growth last year was 1206 HUF, thus during the last year's year's year's increase in the VAT.
Just this process was that the trade was that the supermarketing were unable to make decisions on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the change of prices on consumption.
(If the trademaker plans the speed of a product's holding, it may be a significant benefit in the margin corresponding to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi canastal is such extreme as the increase of the VAT, that the highest increase of 1720 HUF was above to the value recorded in 2006, while in the most short, the difference was only a 844 HUF.
This year there have not been such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the smallest has also increased by 1284 HUF.
As compared to the two ships, a catastrophic growth was recorded in prices in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkts increased more than 30 per cent of the price of the first need for consumption articles.
(But this does not necessarily confirm the numbers of the Central Statistics Office: this Office, in the case of some first needed foods, recorded an increase in price exceeding 30 per cent within 12 months.
For example, besides the wheat, also in the case of egg.)
In this last case, this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product that was pretty worth in comparison with the basis year, it was registered, in the worst cases, only 10 per cent of price increase.
All of the harine suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, which can impose the drastic increase of prices even to the multinationals.
Hypermarkets are not covered in the gold triangle, they continue to speak of positive results.
Our experiences are collected, most of the three visited tents, are no longer interested in prices.
From all products, large quantities are buying, the preserved food is carried out by palettes.
On Wednesday morning, in the three tents were made big clothes before the boxes because he immediately increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that the sales volumes within the country are lower, many multinationals are devoted to the investigation institutions because the income remains under their plans and not only in the case of food but also in the electrodomestics.
In many hospitals, the disinfectants are injured.
This year, a number of thousand of infections produced first by the use of antibiotics have been registered in the hospitals.
Conditions of renewing hygiene in hospitals, laughing and overload of staff do not favor the control of infections - > the National Centre of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals, it is even covered with disinfectants.
There has been no longer a contact with MRSA in the Hospital Yanos Traumatology Department.
In a hospitalized man after a serious accident, the presence of the resistant antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of county has occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A severe car accident was given high from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital as a result of the counterparty with MRSA, and since then, an important chirurgical intervention could not be performed by the presence of the disease in its body.
By 10 December of this year, the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistance agents - Karolina Böröcz, Departmental Director of the National Centre of Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals, in safety, this number of infections produced by multi-resistance agents has been registered, there is no information on the rest.
Near the two third parts of the infections (683 cases) must be MRSA, namely Staphylococcus aureus, resisting meticilin-oxaciline.
One third of the human beings brings Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their narrow without causing any disease.
The infections produced by the SA (e.g. inflammation of gargant, amigdalitis, cut infections, vulnerable infections) are well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, when the antibiotics are applied excessively or inevitably, the antibiotics that normally reverse well are very resistent to antibiotics and quickly count in inadequate hospital conditions.
Several hospital infections, such as infections of fertility or septicemia, may be caused in the first place for patients with transitional or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with debilited body, elderly or small weight.
In view of the doctor-director of the Hospital Yanos there is nothing special in the MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only unexpected - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not being examined.
Resistent to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the staff's staff takes them into guantes of goma and mask, and there are appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but not if you can avoid the infection in all cases.
You can't take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital in most of the cases, but the current national hospital conditions do not contribute to prevention of training and counterparty with multiresident patogen agents - − Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is mainly produced in hospitals and houses of elderly, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, the taking of microbiological samples is not moderate.
This is also required that the National Health Box does not financ these medical examinations.
So most of the cases come out to the public light when MRSA ≥s infections are already produced in the patient - said the head of the epidemiological department.
The European Union makes rigorous recommendations for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicines and there are also national directives to treat pathological infections and tables.
It must be emphasised that antibiotic terapie is directed, or, microbiological examinations should be made to prevent resistance against medicines, but hospitals do not always comply with this requirement.
The taking of microbiological samples is even less frequent in the case of ambulant patients or in the basic assistance - Karolina Böröcz.
Defectives
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases, MRSA is related to a patient to another to a healthy staff.
They thus play a very important role in lavading hands, use of goma and masks, however, in this regard, significant deficiencies are also experienced in hospitals.
The MRSA is counted through the transmission of bottles and direct contact between persons, however, in national hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the patient concerned.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often broken, the beds are often very together, although to prevent epidemia, patients should be separated by at least one distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - Karolina Böröcz acknowledged - that in less favourable economic situation hospitals, there are few and many patients, and therefore there is a greater probability for the infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are fulfilled, are recorded less infections of this type or the county of the patogen agent can be stopped.
Governing Programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA accounts is a great expenditure for the National Sicurity Fund, thus in all countries fighting against it.
For example, in England there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
It seems that the programme has success, if the data provided, MRSA infections show a reduction trend in England.
The European Centre for Disabilities Prevention and Control (ECDC) has, among its priorities, the prevention of multi-resistance agents (including MRSA) and the hospital infections to these patogenian agents.
Negatives the control of the alcoholic control of the police commander that caused a mortal accident
The Periodic Official Report on the case of the death accident caused by the police commander of the XXII police.
It can be excluded the possibility that he was driven by a drink or in a stumbled state of the police commander since then of the 20th century, who was arrested and caused the death of a translator - reported on Friday Attila Morvai, carrier of the Capital General Fisheries, after preparing the dangerous report on the case.
The Periodic report confirmed the outcome of the primary alcoholic control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic drink before it was put behind the flight.
The chief of the police office of the 20th, on Tuesday with its special vehicle by doubleing the Kossuth Lajos Street of the XXII, hit a 55-year-old man who wanted to cross the street, but not in the area designed for peatons.
(This is the last fact that the peaton does not use the cebra to cross the street, if the regulations of the Tranchito Code are not adequate circumstances, the driver must always cease the step at double.)
The transaction lost life after he was hospitalized.
As a result, the police leader of the Deputy dismissed and requested its jubilation, it was the police communication, because he was very moved to him.
The case's investigation is at the Budapest Research Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from a beginning cooperated with the tax officers in the investigation.
400 million more for infrastructure
The Hungarian Minister for Finance Janos Veres and the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed the Friday in Budapest three credit limit agreements for a total value of 400 million euros for financing infrastructure of education, transport and environment, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted in 2006 a budget of 300 million euros for financing in the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the subvention of cohesion funds, from which the parties had already signed a credit contract for a value of 100 million, the contract that they just signed is referring to the use of the rest of 200 million euros.
The credit contract of 150 million euros is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB has approved in total 300 million euros for this purpose of Hungary, on the use of the rest of 150 million euros, the decision will be taken later by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovation, which will mainly use for the project of innovation and research of the University of Debrecen.
The discussions also included the theme of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that, when Hungary finalized the details of the Metro funding with the EU, they will again discuss the issue that if necessary or not amend the original contract and how to do so.
If you have Janos Veres, this may take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed in total 113 projects in Hungary for 8.4 billion euros.
The interest of the credits is covered with EURIBOR and the EIB provides a 8-year benefit period without covering the committee to maintain the credit available to the debt.
Bulgaria, the immobilious paradise of the EU
It is amazing the development of the Bulgarian immobiliary market - the attention of all Europe is guided to that Balkan country, which was recently mentioned.
What, where and those who purchase on the EU market, will be quickly charged?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for immobiliary acquisitions in Eastern Europe is, of course, some Bulgaria, with its bargaining apartments of the ski tracks and the beach chalets.
The mountains of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred regions, as in Albena, the "Costa del Sol", the "Costa del Sol", the former Sozopol and Nesebar, but more people are looking for immobile in the areas of Kavarna and Balchik.
Analysis of Re/Max in Bulgaria, late or early, also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will wake up the interest of the immobiliary promotors and more people will buy immobility in the special charitable area of Russia.
The Sophia capital, commercial spaces and offices can also be attractive to a quick recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, which can also be a determined destination during the two other stations, as well as soil and winter.
Therefore, predicted investors have already purchased their purchases, for example in the areas of Bansko.
In view of the analysts, those who buy immobile in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and their way of living.
Most clients are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
Moreover, Maltese and Cypriot promotors are present, and traditionally there are many Russian customers in the Black Sea Places and in the Scale Paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified in three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to be installed here buy new or renewed by a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or well old houses in bad state between 5 and 15 thousand euros to renew them later.
They need good communication and access, as well as the neighborhood of a large city, tents and generally a local doctor.
The second category includes chalet buyers (Bulgaria was included in December between the first 10 vacational destinations of Germans).
Constitute the third group the immobiliar investors who purchase their purchases with the hope of benefit at a middle or long term.
The price of capital inmunitors continues to grow, since the request is always greater.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest immobiliary prices, in the past five years they have suffered an annual increase of 21 per cent.
The increase in the price of the immobile is considering the growth of the salaries.
Fodor and six per cent of Hungarian
The Ministry of Environment and Hydrologia Gabor Fodor has been informed that meetings at expert level will be completed on Thursday and Thursday after official inscription, negotiations at the level of ministers on international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and political experts from 192 countries in the world will deal with the Bali Road Sheet, which are available on the following efforts on the period of reduction of employment, set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Currently, discussions on the particularity of developing countries and industrialised countries are being encouraged.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate with precise figures, although it is intended to reach the agreement that, in comparison with the situation of 1990, it reduces by 25 to 40 per cent the emissions of gases responsible for the inver ́ro effect.
Another major issue of the conference is that if industrialised countries, as well as reduced, are available to provide material and technological assistance to the countries that need it.
There was also an agreement on the aid to provide developing countries.
The support fund, provided in the Kyoto Protocol, will be addressed by an integrated guideline advice by 16 members, probably within the United Nations Environmental Fund (GEF) - write the "Piac is Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrologia Gabor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its role in the global climate protection and to promote the signature of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister declared that the EU is committed to reduce the 1990 level to 20 per cent of its gases, responsible for the inver ́ro impact, whether it would be signed or not the "the agreement after 2012" and is willing to commit to decrease even 30 per cent if other major regions developed in the world and developing countries are also willing to take commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 committed to decrease at 5.2 per cent, in this case the 15 EU Member States committed to comply with 8 per cent reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce with a 6 per cent the gas emission responsible for the inver-effect for the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply - indicates the press communication of the Ministry of Environment.
It is a lot in Bali, since within two years the international climate policy agreement will be signed, because if not, it is sure that its entry into force would be replaced for 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments taken in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of reduction of lipion, whose need was warned in its latest report by the IPCC, international scientific association of the United Nations, which is involved with the climate change, obtained by the Nobel Premium of the Peace.
Consequently, the reduction of the holdings would suffer a loss and could not prevent a increase of more than 2° C of the average earth temperature, in fact that the centuries would have inconsistent and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recluses YouTube
The British Army units in a video distributor publish filmed actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British air force (RAD) was the use of YouTube services: the special units moved in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos on their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These facilities are made with mini-mounted cameras on casks are controlled in the general body of Kandahar operations, then sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
It is now 139 the resulting areas of air force soldiers which have been loaded in this way to the Internet and their "canal" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Defence Minister was registered in the first-day 2007 under the name of "Defence headquarters" and published videos of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the United Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have its own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the air force had loaded videos with recruitment objectives, but in view of the Defence Minister, they also served to present the public the real objective of the presence of the British Army outside.
This type of propaganda doesn't cost anything in comparison with conventional television recycling spots - stated the BBC to the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - in contrast, they have some political message, since in a specific way they justifie the reason to be military actions decided by the Government.
Americans prepared a video game
The exercise is also concerned about the fact that, besides the reciprocally edited and censured holdings, in the distributor also appear adequate videos, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, some hypocrites, the officers speak as a maximum loss, however, without presenting the bloody part of the fights.
Moreover, from Iraq and Afghanistan's battle fields have been loaded on the Internet many videos in real operations, but the British Army is only lastly using this opportunity.
Americans use a little different way for recycling with shooting video games, freely, called American's Army, in which the player can be placed in the middle of a more or less real situation instead of soldiers.
Salted board and pastelil at the Ministers ' s Christmas Festival
It doesn't seem very sensitive to the Monique Lamperth Work Minister: instead of the ship party, he will celebrate a job for his colleagues who can delay in 2007 with salt and coffee.
There is a minister who will celebrate his festival with live music, in another, they will create the naive atmosphere in the heart of the public officers with tomb and a brindis.
Festival, Christmas environment, concerts and buffet - so you divorce the power.
State offices are also prepared for Christmas.
The greatest Christmas Festival will be held at the Defence Minister, but not for the workers of the Minister.
In the Hourfans' Christmas, the sons of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and the family of the soldiers who are currently performing missions in the outside will be invited.
This portfolio will determine 25 million for the end of the year's festival.
The National Footnote Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (MET) will celebrate a lush festival in respect of the other portfolio festivals
The MET festival will be held at the House del Futuro, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred workers in the Ministry, expected to have approximately 3050.
At the portfolio festival will rule a Christmas environment, they will also act artists, and there will be a lucky tomb.
The UNF's ship costed 4 700 000 HUF and was celebrated Wednesday in the National Justice Council (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The renter of the room costed a million HUF, the rest of the budget was costed for more than four hundred invited.
We have information that workers of one of the Departments of the UNF are also invited to another Christmas Party to celebrate a concurrence management company called Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose, they reached the full building of the Comedia Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, because we do not be able to communicate with the competent person.
You can be assisted without trace
CNAJ's building was not only attending the AFF party but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the dance of Lucia's day on 7 December.
CNAJ of them did not cover anything for the use of their installations.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The festival began with the words of the Minister's health and after the dinner there was a lively bailable music.
In response to the question of [original], they reported: To attend dance, it was not obliged to dress the clothes of night.
Health, work and local administrations are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a programme and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
Instead, the Ministry of the Monica Lamperth work does not expect its colleagues for a ship official party, but for an end-year work.
It is considered to participate in hundred eighty invitations that, as the pressing department would report, will only take coffee and salted bird, so the party will not cover more than 350 000 HUF.
The Ministry for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, in turn, will simply contact his colleagues at the Ministry of Local Governments and Territory Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will celebrate a shipmates festival in its own acts room with 436 employees.
The ship party will have a budget of 2500 HUF by invitation - of this budget will be paid for the receipt with buffet and a brindis.
Since Janos Veres is the Minister, MF workers celebrate the Christmas in the same manner every year.
However, there will be no festival atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech but also by the time of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agricultural portrait will offer a receipt of New Year on 20 January, in the Ministry, the Christmas will not be celebrated.
The receipt will be celebrated in the Vajdahunyad Castillo of the Municipal Park and has been communicated with the portfolio, a budget of 1000 HUF per person for hundred invited.
This is the Department of Press - it will be a very simple receipt, which will be invited only to specialized diplomatics believed in Hungary.
These receipts that are celebrated every year are started with a short health speech of the Minister and concluded with a modesty food.
The Ministries of External and Education and Cultural Affairs will not celebrate any Christmas Festival - this is what the relevant press departments have communicated to him to [original].
In the Department of Environmental Environment Department, they were not able to inform the budget of the Ministry's Navy celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival that will be celebrated in the Museum of Apply Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
They gathered the forces of the gigant yellow
The Sindicates of Liga and the National Commission Federation of Working Commissions will constitute on Wednesday a vote committee to coordinate the moon's hole that will dure for an undefined time.
The Sabbath will be celebrated a protest mitin, while on Monday the final vote on public health law will be started.
With all security, this action will cause great difficulties in the transport, since the railway transit will be completely performed, and until 13 hours the workers of Budapest Collection Transport Company will also be in the steel.
On Friday after Friday, the Liga Sindicates will inform the details of their hole of Monday that will celebrate jointly with the National Work Commission Federation.
The LIGA and the National Syndicate of Machines will also be co-ordinated with the Coordination of Monday action.
The Sabbath will be celebrated a protest mitin, so the participants will be pronounced on Monday in an unfinished holiday, unless an agreement with the Government is not reached.
This means that, on the day of the parliamentary vote on public health law, they did not inform the date of the end of the beginning hole.
If the National Assembly disapproves the public health law, the syndicats will immediately revoke their call to the huelga.
However, if the law is approved, the vote commitments will be gathered and will decide about the future.
On the basis of the agenda of the Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only on public health law is voted in the very hours of night, or at the best near midnight.
As a result of the hole that will be started on Monday, it will be necessary to count significant difficulties in transport: in railways it will stop working for an undefinitely time, the morning may be a part of Budapest's collective transport and more than the half of the interurban bus transport of Volán companies.
Simultaneously, in many points of the country there will be a closed half of the roads.
Numerous civil syndicates and organizations have been attached to the bottle, their names are continually updated on the Liga Website.
Some syndicates announced their hole for undefined time, others for time defined.
Even Thursday's afternoon, the Ferrocarril State and the Free Friday Workers (SSL) could not reach an agreement or even if it had regarded the minimum services, though, when they approached Christmas Festivals, they were more people who travel at the trains.
Information received until now, from the beginning of the day to the 13 hours, the workers of the Budapest Collection Transport Entrepreneur, Budapest Airports from the 7th to the 9th morning, will celebrate a four-hour holiday LIGA Sindicates of the Electronic and the Term Energy Industrie, the Educators called to a 2-8-hour 2-Democratic Syndicate of Educators.
The Hungarian Medical Association will be pronounced in national hours in alternative hours and the Democratic Sindicate of the Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) which are part of the Forum of Cooperation for two hours.
The most important of the four requests made by the Liga is that the Government rejects its proposal on public health reform and submits a new concept to a social debate.
The second request is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force in the next year.
The third is that they will ensure, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions, the possibility of employment that it deserves to be able to enter into the system.
The fourth reason for the wheel is that the Free Friend of Ferroviary Workers, which is part of the Liga Sindicates, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on railway sides and expect another proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by Hungarian Guarantee
The Division of Riesgos' Analysis (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital is the activity of Hungarian Guarantee, established in August this year with the support of the Movement by a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points.
The "warning on risks" of the company is written: With regard to Hungarian Guarantee's activity, the greatest political risk is that "with the increase in existing ethnic stress between the population of Gitan and non-Gitane in Hungary, even short-termly violent ethnic events".
The main reason is that the political strategy of Hungarian Guarantee is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - has aggraved the representative of the investigation institution.
They claimed that this was one of the main deficiencies of Hungarian political protagonists: "The protagonists of public life ceased the public debate of the Gitan problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, which could base their political strategy on existing discriminations between gitanees and Hungarians."
This enhances the problem, impossibilities of normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the probability of enlargement of violent conflicts - they estimate.
Furthermore, research institution, the activities of the National Guarantee, due to the great attention of the national and international average, "deteriorated significantly the picture of Hungary outside, especially in relation to the stability and democratic development of the country."
They recall that: from ottoom 2006, it has received more publicity and encouraged the reorganization of the radical and extreme groups of Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 have been established in the country many organizations that are autodefined by "national self-defence associations".
"The common race of these groups is that they are self-defined as civil organizations, while they declare openly the training of their members for defence - even armed - ( civil defence, national defence, public defence) by highlighting the police ineptitudes, the exercise, namely the State's.
They affirmed: All of this occurs in accordance with the method that gives you a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the disadvantage of society with political and political parties.
You can highlight civility and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serve to avoid legal issues of legal registration, but it is also a political strategy at the same time.
The analysis is, the Hungarian Guarantee's activity is also a risk factor from the view of neighborhood relations.
"In the past months, in many neighbors countries, the Hungarian Guarantee as a potential danger, while the ultranationalist political figures of some neighbors want to justifie their own anti-Hungary policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guarantee,
All this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
The Institute of Research is, the Constitution of Hungarian Guarantee is not an isolated phenomenon in the Centre and East Europe, so political risks have increased in the whole region.
They wrote that Hungarian Guarantee works in a similar way as for example the Bulgarian National Guarantee, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of extreme debt.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is debt to the massive disturbances of the gitanians produced in one of the Sophia Barriers (Krasna Poliana).
By using this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization is "national self-defence".
In its opinion, in the past 17 years there was "Gitan territory" in Bulgaria, however, the State remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - reaffirms the Political Capital.
They added: This initiative has caused an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increase in the risk of ethnic operations which some gitan organizations of Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will be their own guard.
As the Hungarian Guarantee's operation has shown similarities to the National Guarantee of Bulgaria, it can not be excluded that Hungary's gitans also re-reject the threat in the same way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
The Director of Research of the Political Capital, Attila Juhász, at the question of the news agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institution.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can affect the change of risk, they inform the public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their warning on risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the Law defines accurately the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalized practice that I return to the festival days - that the year coming will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not if it is in the EU or in North America, the festivals are awesome.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national festivals, state festivals and festivals.
The festivals are fundamentally related to religious and historical festivals.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is a festival - this is the last one, especially so that they may rest those who have passed by celebrating the old year.
Every year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, memorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, we celebrated the foundation of the State, on 1 May the festival of work, on 1 and 2 November we remembered our famous families and friends.
Moreover, in our country there are two-day festivals of the Resurrection Passover, Pentecost and Christmas.
The calendar, our national, or religious festivals are sometimes matching a weekend, so it often becomes poor when there is only one working day before or after the festival.
Instead of extended weekend ends, during the previous weeks, the work or school cannot be unexpected.
It is the Ministry of Work that regulates in its specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in turn to the holiday right or later at the festival.
This legal standard is mandatory for all the employees and their employees, as well as for public employees and officers.
It is not obligatory in exchange for enterprises and services institutions that, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during the festivals.
This year the work order can only be changed around the end of the year's festivals: from 24 December, life is practically stopped in the country, since experiences are held, most of the people "speak" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacations during these days.
The next year, several of our festivals will coincide with average or weekend ends, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
The agenda will be amended first to the work festival so that the workers may rest for four days.
The Sabbath, 26 April, will be working day, so that on Wednesday, 2 May, the festival is held.
The other change is related to the festival of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, it will have to work instead of Friday 24.
Instead, the year in the end of the year can be rested, since from 24 December it will not work at almost any part, nor although the last day of the year is a midnight.
Six little girls disocious to enhance your colleagues' lives
Emails we have been sent, sound messages that we have never received, innocent lies that pass us without notice: all of them are part of our Folclore daily in the work.
You must decide whether you adjust to the small tribulations or avoid convinced confusions that can irritate others.
Councils.
Excuse me, I was invited to warn you that they were looking for you from the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues."
What's why you didn't go to a date?
In the best of the cases it feels and repair the matter, the best calls the marketing department to tell you that it was given to you the message (that is the less usual solution).
Most times the matter is resolved by asking for excuses.
Before conducting a deep explainment, it deserves the penalty to meditate on things with which you can enhance your colleagues' lives and strive to avoid them.
You've got something that's not yours?
There's no more irritant thing than when you want to take a document, a Office utility or your phone and you don't find them.
Do you remember that you put the tape on the table yesterday, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost boligraph on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't leave anything to your colleagues without asking them, because they'll be angry with you for substrating their things.
Don't kitchen over or post-it of the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and go up before the time.
Do you think about your colleagues' privacy life?
There is no good solution to stop sounds that are running.
Who, what's he doing and with who?
Where and why?
Don't pass all the information that you have about your colleagues' particular life!
Don't dismiss your colleague's confidence when you're with you your most intimate secrets!
Enter in yourself what you have heard and do not judge about your colleague in his absence, although others also know his things.
Are you going to be licensed for illness injustice?
When you call the office by phone and say you're fair and you're insoporting your head, you feel bad or well, you feel that that day you're prefering to relax; think that others should do your job, your unnecessary tasks, your work by term.
Don't hurt your colleague!
If you know forward that the next day you will not go to the office or something can happen to you, so you must stay home, communicate, so that your colleagues or your boss don't have to confront you on the next day.
Tarares, rites, telephone calls
Are you put in your work, but you're fucking getting out of him the rices of your colleagues?
Have you involvingly heard a telephone conversation that would be better not listening to her?
Don't hurt your colleagues with your talents, songs, talks in high voice (minds when you do them above their head), patates, constant blasphemies, expressing your decontents in high voice.
All these may be troubled, although they are not deeply deeply in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Did you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished anything at time, you have been invited to send a important letter or a message!
Don't glorify the chaos eventually dominant in the office, nor the sound that your colleagues do!
You must recognize if you have done a mistake that hurts others and you must repair the deficiency!
Ask how you can repair your missing!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: very comfortable habit for the house, but it's not suitable for the office!
You don't see a comfortable playing although your occupation allows it!
Don't be disregarded, respect your colleagues and yourself by watching daily, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation so requires it!
You lose interest if you want to comply with the public's expectations
The car goes quietly in the morning awake.
It sounds a strange composite in the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm up the volume.
Switch music and to the previous tons the low is added and then the voice of a female coron as a real joy intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
National musical life didn't hurt us very much with electronic pop of quality.
But now this attack seems totally different when you're listening to the new disc of Zagar.
It appears Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs of the subground [b2]digital [b3] nationally shortly changes the image and although the rock garage style again is moda, guitarras breaks, the national pop electro has shown: there are news under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pês, touched the Yonderboi set until he started his independent career maybe because both cannot be protagonists of the same.
With your project (Zagar) and your music, a jazz mixer, a bailable and pop electronic music, he tried to triumph when they asked him soundtracks [b4] cinematographs (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The largest public knew that in a principle only acted in small clubs when the magazine wan2 selected its first disc edited in 2002 between the fifty major national discs, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi as the only national trainer of trends, also able to sell on the western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and her together are modesty, but no one has asked them if they are taking or not pleasing this tag.
The total repeated how to repeat: prepared a new and even better disc.
The recently launched disk, entitled Cant Walk Fly Instead, can open new paths for them, although the own title intends to set the continuity with the early years in the city of PÃ©s.
Then this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
It's well the reference to the aircraft, the flight, but also the aerosol of music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitarra that sounds stronger, the effect of the rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the disc in the Millenáris György Ligeti, the currently working in England with the whole The Puzzle.
The disc includes a real success of the Mr2 Petõfi Channel that lastly transmits from morning to the popular night music. This holdora led to the ears of the radiogeneans the high-flight music of Wings of Love, with six Hungarian songs (Divas Underground").
And then everything's okay (?).
Hvg.hu asked Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: What are you interpreting, in what way is a music dedicated to a selected public?
Zságer Balázs: Selected public definition for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of casts in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
The so-called alternative music underground can also be buried, without sense and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercially.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The hearers also work with this spirit, independent of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between your music accommodation by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: In the foreign, especially the west of us, light music has greater traditions.
This is not only the fifty-twenty-year generations of the concerts, but also the elderly.
They take much more attention to the changes in the light music around them, because they consider it part of the modern culture.
hvg.hu: What function does the public have in your work?
You worry who they are, where they are, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course, I feel good to see that you've always attended more people at our concerts.
But we never have made music for the market.
We don't compose music for any purpose, but for any reason.
The role of the public is better in the concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the unconceptable changes of the time.
And however, I realized that if you want to fulfill the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what point do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked in solitary and made his career better at the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow your way, despite they sometimes try to compare our music with him.
We work better in team, trust in the musical presence of the other and let it be developed.
In a principle, it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi music, since many of us start our career in your group and we start another way.
hvg.hu: In the list of successes of Mr Petõfi Wings of Love is first.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in relation to this song.
Did you consciously open with this style towards a larger row?
Zs.B.: We didn't want to compose great success and sell our disc with these successes.
This song is something more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the weakest themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a coron of gospel style.
Then I came the idea of creating this core of the solists of good voice of our own national music scenario.
That coron of six women - or Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Jude Neemeth - was then baptized as Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Have you composed exactly this song or girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song was a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material of the disc, we thought something still missing.
The agreement was attached to the song.
Still that night I grew the song that the girls later had.
Everything came nearly to the first intention and incrediblely spontaneous form.
I remember, I was very entusiasmed then, but naturally I needed the Dives too.
With my voice, I wouldn't have worked so much.
hvg.hu: So much in the concert as on the disk seems like if girls were in the background.
There are no solistas (excluding the short only of Judy Jay), they have no own role, they sing all together and not more stronger than music, so music is not just accompanied by its songs.
The scenario is also located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They're just in the background for technical problems.
Instead, we didn't want to distribute solista papers.
The song also turns on it, on which we give a mouse of our ego, who is from where he has come and to where he goes, let those walls, the walls of love, raise us.
I would like to achieve that others would also feel that euphoric anxiety that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: To what more work did you dedicate?
Zs.B.: In the musical composite actually no, rather at the time of mixing, there were more difficult parts.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert plan or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long mouse, he didn't want to work the groove and then, a little while, everything left her place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with concerts and because I've already "susted" the disc.
Now the prophet is a fool, the escape from the Earth and the Never The Same.
A bottle currency traitor risks thousands of millions of dollars for its full of lowerness
A bad disloyal.
This is as it indicates to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking gigant of the General Society, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems better that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to be compared to his colleagues and, of course, with good capacity.
He has introduced a long time ago, in contrast to all the large Czech Republics, the crisis on the American hypoteques market.
"He has a fragil character" left to hear of his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what is discovered from Kerviel's answers is what the French media translate, such as Le Monde journal, is that it was a man who at the end of the past year had a profit of more than 1,600 million euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was winning money for myself" assured your answers.
Exactly, in the summer, he was able to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has seen her at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news about sub-prime hypotech calls offered to low income clients or those who in the past had problems with payments and that these customers would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect all the economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1,600 million.
"When I have won my first 500 million I don't know how to notify it," she confess Kerviel and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, absolutely.
All the questionnaire stated that it had made the records so that it would not reach its discovery.
He even came to lied the boss, even when the Eurex Bolsa begins to be interested in her business.
The risk has become beneficial
Did you have to find out?
Better, no.
"I thought I had won 1.600 million for the EEC and that from that simple fact, that would please you."
Where did he get so much willingness to risk that way?
I had to work gradually in my position.
He came to work in General Society in 2000, exactly after the end of study in Lyon.
Its annual floor was handled between $ 51,000.
Two years later, he was a Boulsa currency assistant and in 2005 was converted into a bulk course with a year of $90,000.
I still knew that I would never win as much as others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I have already observed that they looked carefully at me.
Because of my training and my professional and personal progress, Kerviel described researchers.
But at the short time of my entrance in the company, the first great success arrived.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, during the attacks with bombs in London, playing a 500 million euro title below.
And this had a launch mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, let's leave you.
"This is like a snow bottle," the police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew all of this or that they had more doubts about it.
"When he won money, they closed the eyes."
Only that, later, the fight came at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost billions of euros.
After the weekend to the half of January, he wanted to delete all the bullet.
When Monday came to work, I didn't work anymore.
And two days later, the announcement announced that he had lost $5.000 for his fault.
And how could they find him?
It's going to be suspected from his vacations.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The corridor that has no vacations is a corridor that doesn't want anyone to look at his expedient," Kerviel ended.
Czech Republic has the possibility to achieve 365 billion
The ministers of the Government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes of which the Czech Republic could gain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
It is approximately half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for 2007 to 2013.
Seven operational programmes will exit approximately 125 billion crowns for the regions.
Czech enterprises can obtain about 100 billion crowns of the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be intended for transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can achieve from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State fund for infra-transport infrastructure, which will be counted by 90.800 million crowns in the next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme should serve undertakings and enterprises to gain resources in the innovation of businesses.
Companys should be financed for the acquisition of new technologies, industrial research and the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among recent income countries as less they use them.
Twenty-year-old for the representative of Nicaragua, the court decreed
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua decreased on Thursday the 20-year pension for the representative of the country, Arnaldo German, which was condemned in 2003 by 100 billion dollars (approximately 1.800 million crowns).
Nevertheless, a while later, he was released from prison to pass to home arrest in his non-remote face from the Nicaras metropolis.
It is nothing clear at this time, the AP agency is that, then, the head of the Central American State between 1197 and 2002, was again between rays.
The President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, will be more dependent on the penitential agents if they leave Germany to finish their punishment home or if they make it back to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed that Germany continued to transfer the government's money to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was ficticity, and the account was actually belonging to its nearest family and partners.
A part of this money ended in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the elections of 2001.
We were thus approved by the budget
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first prepared by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of opposition.
The budget of this year was already approved with the support of CHSSD, since Minister Sobotka and CHSSD prepared it could not be allowed to not accept it.
In addition to various debates before voting on the vote of confidence to the Government, this time nothing was dramatic.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional view, even though the most influent, adopted the new law with quietness.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter of the budget, please or not.
The budget is a major part of the policy, but it is hidden by the rivality of power between government and opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore give you special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than the simple numbers.
The budgets of the State of the last governments of social democrats suffered from three defects that for this year 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of obligatory laws, called as expenditure of mandataries that are not only pensions but also the social benefits that have been adopted in the past year before the "silencious" coalition of the CHSSD and KSČM elections.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public financing, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and under control.
However, the hour bomb is located in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many employees to be able to obtain other investment sources, except money from taxes, taxes and credits, often issued obligations with which they were unproportionately engaged in their assemblies.
In recent years, these debts were able to be paid through the massive sale of energy action and other development networks received from the state and privatisation.
They are not currently accounting for this resource.
If we only focus on the official and checked facts, we find out that:
Our economy, a few years ago, has passed through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, what the CSSD is hurt.
This was the ideal opportunity for its government to order State funds.
However, instead of that, the state continued to be committed.
The rest of countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have economyed much more than our Republic.
It is a great view that falls, especially in the previous government.
We belong to nations that within global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
Therefore, the social massive programmes are not necessary that, despite the recent years, have unusually been drawn up with gigantic measures.
And although they have been able to remove part of the incomprehensible popular costs adopted this year before elections, if the age of jubilation and reform of pensions is not quickly changed, then the end of any policy in this country will be actually, and the government will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little, we can say that government politicians will be transformed into officers, mechanical sharers of the majority of the taxes for jubilation and social benefits.
Therefore, the budget of this year cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal costs of the mandatary expenditure.
The deficit planned for more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not misleaded what they could in the past ten years.
We would not want politicians to become only officers of the Government to be patient and to grant this weak coalition of the government, which is recognized that the state can only cost what is able to get from taxes and taxes, peace for the preparation of other reforms of laws.
Only this will enable the paulatin achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British Central Banks, its and Canada decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the monetary market, more than 100 billion dollars will be received by claims.
In these claims, the rate of interest is highlighted by the interests for which they are able to provide money.
For example, the American Fed will send for 40 billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion will facilitate the Central Actions of Europe and its Property.
After the attacks of September 11, it is the first time the central stages of different states agreed in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the largest economic problem, which is, the continuous growth of the free capital lack that the ­s could provide" wrote in its report for customers, Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group Advisory Company.
"This coordinated action of the Central Assets probably reduced the receipt in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," added Baumohl to its report.
The debts have already costed $60 billion in charged credits, especially in the United States.
Economys are still waiting for thousands of millions in losses.
"The centrals must really be afraid of what they expect yet when they decided to take this step," said the main economicist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"The situation seems really bad," he added.
Central responsibility fears that they have the same problems of access to loans and that they will have to provide their customers more carefully.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central responsibility decided this way, after they could not be able to reduce the LIBOR tariff, the Londry Interbank Tax is used for the interest in the interbancary market.
This means that the people were constantly afraid of paying money even when the United States Central Banks, Canada and Great Britain had reduced their types of interest several times during the hour.
"He will have the same effect as another fall of the types of interest," he said to the agency Re日s, Greg Salvaggio of the Tempus Consulting company.
Some economicists don't surprise that the step given by the centrals contributes to the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the immobilious market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of theologists are incredible
Global climate change affects mainly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed regarding the problem of global calamity.
The criticism has now occurred with the clause of the United Nations International Conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book A日, not a Green Planet, he commented that the debates of theologists were incredible.
Se · Klaus is not only acceptable to the conference that creates an extraordinary mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the retoric used and the reality.
"There are only discussions, there are artificial fires of words, substitutes of the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President under the presentation of his book highlighted that this issue is very important for him and that it is therefore interested.
He also expressed his joy in discovering his book translated to German because, as he said, "too many times I just meet with the loading of my ideas."
Now the interested ones can be informed of their various opinions.
Klaus remembered that it is not a climatologist but it has, if it is, its opinion, enough suspects as to write a book like this.
It is academic, with ability to continue and judge a specialized disertation, has experiences with statistics and is also economicist.
At the main time of the clause, it expressed its thought that climate is constantly changed and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so big and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that the attempts to influence climate development are unusual, inefficient and costly inacceptable.
In addition, as a man experienced with the total ́smos, it is unacceptable to introduce not-proved opinions to others, which feels a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
The issues of the present stated repeatedly that it is not against "the reasonable environmental defensors but against military politicians who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
The same subject was Klaus in Vienna for two months ago in the Hayes Institute.
600 thousand people haven't been able to change their flesh of conduct
To six hundred thousand drivers, the date was passed, and thus they did not change their old sheep to drive whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today, it is the last day people can ask for the change that the officers may take time to the end of the year to issue the new sheep.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers without the valid sheep are found.
Traffic is, the sheep has not mainly changed those who want to drive.
While the people announce a quick decline of the change of sheep in the people, the metropolis offices are full of requests and the interest of the new sheep has increased.
The Avenue calculates about 2.000 daily customers.
It's waiting for a half hour in the halls.
In Prague, the new sheep has not yet been taken out of about 140,000 drivers.
The emission of a new sheep takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the emission of the sheep within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay fifty crowns.
The drivers who are obligatory to change their sheep and do not reach until the end of the year, but they shall go out to the roads without the valid meat shall be risked for a flag from January.
The criminal will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can arrange the crime with an admonishment.
In case of administrative infraction, the burden will rise to 2.500 crowns.
Previous information could be received to the person who doesn't go anywhere.
They could probably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry invited the offices to enter moderately thousand coroners, as maximum.
It is the vocabulary of the Transport Minister, Karel Hanzelka, a thousand crown pounds don't threaten anyone.
It is he, the sheep of conduct is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity sheep that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the sheep to drive.
It's enough to bring it or send it by certificate mail to municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the sheep issued during the 1964 and 1993 remains valid.
However, the drivers must go shortly by changing the other types of sheep to drive.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the sheep issued between 2001 and 2004 ended in December 2013.

The Court reduced the penalty to Berdych's compliance detectives
The former police Joseph Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complication with the criminal David Berdych will pass between thirty and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a definitive end to reduce the penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the department would be pleasing against the organized crime, at a beginning, between 14 and 12 years.
Only by revocation by the Supreme Court, the decision of today cannot be revoked.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he first expects the judgment of the Court of First Instance.
Despite that, in other processes, a total of 16 years has been sentenced.
You can't get anymore.
In January, the Court of Auditors recognized the participation in the attack of 19 persons and the Supreme Court, today, revoked 16 of them.
The majority of the accusations of the accused ones were undertaken by the investigation for the causes of invented causes.
The Senate of Central Bohemia, the members of the police in agreement with Berdych reported of police sources to criminals, covered robes, and helped criminal group members to avoid penalties.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their robe to Opava and Knock.
The accusation refers to criminal acts made by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to the robe, their victims have suffered serious impact on their health, but they are also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without weapons.
In the home register, the police found guns, munition with rail nuclear, a lazer manager and an ammetrilla.
The group of criminals, if the accusation is, has stolen tens of millions of crowns.
Except almost a twenty men in this process, the court has already recognized Berdych and other guilty.
Other men related to the case of Berdych are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomas Pot and Maroš Schulej, who for now have avoided the judgment, are in prison in Ireland where they expect the final decision on their delivery to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
A account for changing children: 12 million
To change some children in the maternity House, Igor Veleba's lawyer, Igor Veleba, wants from Trebič's hospital 12 million refund crowns more the expenditure of the court.
For each mother, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondréj Dostal is not in principle in accordance with Veleba's proposal.
"The request we don't approve, it's too high," Dostal said after today's.
"In order to make a idea of this contra proposal, we need the report of the expert that the opposite has sent to investigate.
We'll show if he has a rescue value.
We keep on thinking that they will be hundreds of thousands for everyone." He highlighted Dostal.
The amount should be moved between the 1000,000 and the 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jabloň’s family wanted, for each month that they did not create their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Wayba was served as a basis to negotiate the compensation of the expert report, only that it was developed in the Motol's faculty hospital in Prague.
Children's parents are specialists in psychology and psychiatricity suffered from mental and stress of different levels and depths.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although the change of girls had been combated.
Women bring him worse with the trauma they are living now and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Verónica and Nicola were changed by the workers in the Trébič's motherhood House last year, the nineth December.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Chermákkov and Pribyslavic, and Verónica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloń.
The Governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčich, delivered at the end of October to each family 1000,000 coroners as compensation costs for the error made in the Trebič hospital that the region manages.
All Czech Republic hospitals are assured by law as responsibilities for damage.
In the case of errors, they must be extracted from the reserve fund and may be extraordinaryly requested for aid to the administrator.
The court until today recognised a proportionally low compensation, the amounts calculated are the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly of a million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the pleit on the markup of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
The court of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first used by the markup of Valaquia, but the project was created for many years by Tomás Harabish with whom the actor cooperated.
The polyval wasn't present today in oral view.
Your lawyer is probably not finished and your client will recall.
"The pleit consists of Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka popularity," he said after the process, the lawyer of Polívka.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, the image of the actor and the comic is all over the world.
The same idea has Harabish too.
"We followed us about ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities" said.
For him, the cause of the pleit is in the money.
" After years, I realized that the project was successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
The Court of Justice was first used by Polívka in its television programme.
In 1993, actor Radoslav Brzzobohati was coordinated.
Then it wasn't trying to direct it to the creation of a ficticial kingdom.
A few years after Harabish, he had been editing the Passover of the Valaquia Kingdom.
From that comic origin, there was a profitable business and business activities from which Harabish later created the Kingdom society of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed with the use of its name and signature in passports and even offered his owners disregarded visitors and assistants to their spectacles.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today the judge also decided that Harabiš only uses a simple idea that Polívka has made public at the scenario for its own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Valaquia Kingdom," the judge said.
However, he added that in the spirit of the project there is Harabish and its team who were completely dedicated to it.
The cooperation, among the decompressed parties today, continued until 2000 when Harabish organized the official coronation in Vsettin for Polívka.
Since that moment, they began to conflict between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the destruction of the "Ry Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, by means of Harabish's mediation, was in the song Jarmila Schuláková, as a mother's mother.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accusation against Harabish and his society that has been committed by the court to this day.
Something clearly could be brought in the litigio, the turnover through the throne with its princess, which is already preparing Harabish.
The new king should go out of him.
You didn't want to show more data or date.
"We don't have any speed.
I'd have to be something like the road of the king to Moravia.
The king should be chosen at a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can be presented" added Harabish.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: overflow
I never liked too much Peugeotu 206.
His travel characteristics never were anything special, the quality of the change box, maniobra and the product could also be characterized as under the average.
But now there is on the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I'm just going to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, for example, I was cut off the head space in the back sitting.
But this would be the only box because the Combi carrossery means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters of length.
Flighting through the World
I'm going through the inside quickly so that you don't repeat it too much.
It is a elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here would more value the design invention, even though the car seems pretty elegant.
Sittings are comfortable, there are the times where we had a short seat and support.
On the contrary to model 206, the side direction has also improved consideration.
And the space? and here you can feel how carrosser measures have grown.
In the Combi, the number of spaces in the header is dismissed.
Maletic diseases
But the main thing in this vehicle is your malter.
This must be considered as very difficult (that is the back port that is abased) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with goma mails that provide a ideal solution.
They are not moleculed, and can be extended to the point of submitting heavy objects.
But let's stay in the deposit.
Tables are described, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 litres, which is more than a average value in comparison with competition.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type of most sold in the Czech Republic, the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav model, we make sure that Peugeot remains at the square with its 52 litres perceptible.
From vacations to the foreign or by putting the child's cocktail is critical.
But if I had to say something positive, then I have to quote the step that remains quite planning after it wash the supports of the second line.
120 horses in four rounds
Our car tested was equipped with a four-valve injection engine on a capacity of 1,6 l. and a 88 kW force.
And to say true, that's how it should look like a 1600 that's less to the family five doors.
It's quiet, consumes little, and especially, it's impulse.
If I compare it to the time of the damage of the time that I looked like the escape tube was taponed by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all bottles.
However, let's note that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection extent of 1400 per 329.900 coronas, is still possible.
Our aggregates put it from 410.900 corns, which is too much.
The type Premium tested is already reaching other 80,000 coronas.
Only we would have airbag still in the heads, autoconditioned air, auto-parabris, back-up windows...
That's, the car, all of it, costs 53°900 crowns.
It's very much, but it's counting the team plugins in the Fabia and it's going to reach a very similar number.
Now it's just to decide for which of the two marks.
Slovak students are not integrated in English schools
In English schools, children of East Europe's countries are assisted, and thus placeholders fear more changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans now brings only a series of problems.
Even British schools record the cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of the nationals increase in violence.
The problem of integration of East European children in the British Schools is very well illustrated in the North Kent city, where conflicts between nationals and Slovak emigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronches between students have already reached their own parents.
The situation has reached so far that Chatmam's police arrested a Slovak woman that was taking paws to a ten-year student with a green wheel.
In her defense he said the girl was insulting her son with racist tone insults.
The police had to act also after an attack of two young girls of age against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls took her with racist insults and took her stones.
"When we went home, a boy approached us to the stop of the bus and began to shoot us.
When I told him that he would leave it, he made us the ademian to lay us hands and pearls, and then the pantalons down and showed us his back" described another unfair incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The kids are both parts.
One of the nations even designated the conflict with the East Europe Emigrants as a fight against super-emigration.
The cases already mentioned earlier show us how the environment in English schools begins to be very tenso.
In Greece there are 70,000 Slovaks who came there for working reasons.
Approximately approximately 30,000 Slovak students are attending English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Whatever he expects from his vacations can be fulfilled, if he chooses correctly.
Arenous and dared plays, big oils or a quiet sea like a stone.
palms and all included with cameras offering pizzas in the beach, frozen or cocktail variations.
Kitesurfing, golf and ruleta.
On the Caribbean Island you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds much more and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful in all the Grand Antilles.
At the Spanish times, Cuba came to be the bathroom of the conquist of America.
Colon called her, the most beautiful place that man's eye has seen.
Habana became a storage and load gate of the treasures that Spanish people drove from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American time.
The National Hotel grows at the end of the 20th century.
He commanded him to build one of the American Mafia heads, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was of crime in the United States (and therefore, ́do) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, games and prostitution.
Among their guests were there, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In La Habana, high buildings arose, by wide range, the cars that were a symbol of worship in the past 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway was buying a shot in San Francisco de Paula, near La Habana, and Cojimar had his yat.
In the walls of the Media Bodeguita, the stars of the world of the spectacle and politicians of all America have left their signatures.
And today?
In the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the Caro Hotel National, cocktails mixed you are their desires.
And these cars of worship in the 50s, even today, are still working on La Habana, because those Lada and Fiat who have come for a while have been oxided between these humble and wind salts.
Although La Habana, especially the ancient camp, was deteriorating note, there is not in the surroundings of so many wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beautifulness, for example, Trinity.
Because tourism brings so much money necessary, its development is guaranteed.
In the past fifty years, new hotels have grown not only in La Habana but also in Varadero, in the coast of Holguin and in islotes such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and which is very valued by the railway lovers.
The sugar bottle is transported from the large plants to the sugar factories by way east in vapor machines or the truck.
Their cooks for decades have not been discovered and are now -- machines that work, and their models of brothers in other parts of the world are only in museums.
Where to go?
The most known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, there is no need to talk more about La Habana or Varadero.
Maybe, just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway's face there is a museum that for those who love the writer should not stop visiting him.
The Viñales valley is the most pintoric neck of Cuba at the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in lands of caliza rock.
Mogotes, rock pills and rocks of high rocks in the falls of the valley, and in their gross are aclimated feet lands grateful to rocks that hide from that vegetation.
The valley is the place where, probably, the higher quality tobacco is cultivated in Cuba.
Visiting some of the pure pure fabrics can be found with its final product.
Maybe someone seems interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
An old abollenge city which was founded not long after Spanish colonizing the island.
Slaveness and sugar brought her fame and richness.
The richness became beautiful with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French colons arrived later, has only changed in four centuries.
Trinity, between the sea and the Serra of Escambray, is a place so apart that in the past 50th century there was no way to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built, and there is nothing destroyed, for everyone was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than one afternoon, you deserve the pen to know interesting places in the neighbors around such as the Ancón Playa or the Valley of Sugar Fabrics.
the night belongs to the Music House, which with its music encourages the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
Small city in the west extreme of Cuba, some view it as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is already confirmed by its own way.
The two roads coming from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that only knows the action of the man.
This east of Cuba has been inscribed as the Patrimonium of Humanity by UNESCO thanks to its nature intact.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Colón (in fact, it is a cross coming 100 years later from the ship) and from the mountain, where the castle was located and that there is now a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Café, rock, pure, Serra Maestra, the Bahia of the Cochines and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the Cuba pattern, the Virgin of the Carity of Cobre, the Santeria, the African religion who practiced the seeds of those slaves, could be filled with many pages.
However, as it is said, it's better to see it ever.
Alliados are passive in Afghanistan, the Americans say
Small soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is affecting the course of mission in Afghanistan.
The OTAN, is the American Defence Minister, Robert Gates, should design a specific plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not result as it was thought, the representatives of the countries in the southern part of the country matched Edimburg (Scotland).
At the same time as the conflict with the Taliban movement grows, today the eight participating states discuss plans and coordination of allocations.
While the United States this week through its Defence Minister, Robert Gates, encouraged the NATO forces to increase the activity, Great Britain views the priority to strengthen the government's authority and the department of development assistance.
"Development in Afghanistan is pampable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to enable the population that they can only start economic and security development," the Defense Minister, Des Browne, said to the BBC.
The ninety percent
The activity of Afghanistan rebels is data of the American army is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased in comparison with the last year in 27 per cent, and in the Province of Helmand up to 60 per cent.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan whose fourth part is in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the associates have reached the same limit in the organization and equipment of units.
Exactly they ask more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghanistan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete objectives for the future and how we will achieve them," said Gates.
In a similar sense, the Secretary-General of the OTAN, Jaap de Hoop, also spoke today.
"I am not glad to know what we have on earth and the heavens in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's little," De Hoop said to the agency Reʹs in the meeting of three days with the Japanese Government in Tokio.
Who's passive
Among the assistant countries in the past months, the pole of whether all associates do the maximum in Afghanistan.
By passive, for example, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are located in a area of minimum violence and the needs of fighting there are not as high as in our, in the south and east part of the country," said Gates.
The Sensationalist Sun magazine, this week he called vagues to the German soldiers.
"Afghanistan rebels discover that Germans are dedicated to play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material associated with German soldiers playing the table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a graphics where the British Trop played a rugby party in the south part of Afghanistan.
The State debt will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech, the State is worth 84,000 crowns.
The total debt came to 842.1.700 million crowns in September.
This year, the Government planned to provide 159.200 million crowns.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns thanks to the improvement of the economy of the state budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic increased at the end of September to 842.1.700 million crowns.
In nine months of this year, it increased in 40.200 million crowns.
However, since June, 13,400 million crowns have been reduced.
Today, the Ministry of Economics confirmed its data on the debt of the status of the principles of October.
For each check, the debt corresponds to 84,000 coronas.
For the past year, the State was devoted to more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of the next year we could pass the billion crowns to 2009.
The next year the debt should be moved between the 90 million and the billion crowns" said to the iHNed.cz server, the patria Finance economy, David Marek.
Similarly, the Next Finance economicist Vladimir Pikora also sees: "We could pass the billion for 2009.
Exactly when this will depend on the next budget we have not yet known.
If the situation at the political scale changed and politicians would be able to distort, then it could be repeated in 2010.
But this change I don't see it," he added.
The Double Cress
The debt of the state is debt in the central government and is, in particular, of the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The State debt is paid by the money of the stock, state obligations, direct credits, or for example the European Investment Assets.
The internal debt of the state increased from 38.500 million to 719.400 million crowns this year.

The average winning of the state debt increased in 6,5 years.
"The total interannual debt of the first to the third trimester creation is 13 per cent which is greatly given as the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated in particular of the obligations where there is a growth of 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt grows but, on the other hand, shows that it will be negotiated until there is a reform of pensions." Pikora recommended.
Better than expected
From the payment strategy and the management of the state debt for 2007, the Government planned this year to provide 159.200 million crowns.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry decreased the plan in 152.1.800 million crowns thanks to the improvement of the development of the state budget.
The amount is, in particular, composed of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be of 76 million crowns instead of the 91.300 million crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with approximately 13.300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payment, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1.800 million crowns in payment of the European investment loans.
He compared today before a court to Jartúm for having given a name to a peak boss
The British teacher judged in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court of Jartúm to 15 days of prison and exposure, indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of have left students from 6 to 7 years to give the name of Mahomet to a peached boss when every representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was passable for a lattice pen.
This British school teacher at age 54, depending on the University High School of Jartum in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday in his house and invoked of attention to Islam and of se, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of various wounds of students from the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story is actually remonted in September, when this teacher asks his students, at 6/7 years of age, to choose a name for the class's wheel.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of the children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," accounts the director of the Robert Boulos School.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children of each 23 have chosen Mohamed as a preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the nose with the following reading " My name is Mohamed ".
He - himself had no label with this name, but the problem is just the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gi≤an Gibbons, professor at the same school in Sudan, needed to know well and that he would never have done something that could be insultant to a religious faith, "I just feel that he had asked the children to vote for a name ", it is he only of an " innocent error."
The opinion divided by many students of the school teacher that described it as " very attention to their students " and " that never talks about religion in class."
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, which is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by the Muslims is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules that consist of the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a player?
Of course, it is a question of interpretation.
Wednesday they have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province during the last negotiations meeting in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
The Serbs and the Albanians of Kosovo have completed the midnight morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regretable that the parties have not been able to reach a agreement on the status ", stated the European Wolfgang Ischinger mediator during a press conference in Vienna.
Submitting that peace in the region was " in game", his American homolog, Frank Wisner, encouraged and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not predict violence for now but we enter in a very difficult period," he added, indicating that " evident pressures exist."
End of the average on 10 December
The mediators of the troice, which repeat the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last month in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of popularity to 90% of Albanian could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will have its relationship with the United Nations Security Council, from here to December 10th.
Baden's discussions, near Vienna, were the sixth session and last negotiations since the troic has been acquired of a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
And Europeans and Europeans believe that their mediation will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the concession of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on the persecution of negotiations beyond that date.
"The Russia was and was committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of administration of the United Nations of Kosovo, the OITs consider that the independence under supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to declare it in a single way if the Security Council does not solve it in its favour.
It insists on an increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fat日 Sejdiu, at Baden's hotel, where these " negotiations were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, ancient commander of the Kosovo rebellion and the future Prime Minister of the Province, has been part of its weaknesses.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by "pertained to a past that led to murderers and deportations".
" Effect dominated "
The Serbian President Borís Tadic considered that a commitment was always fair, warning the majority of Kosovo against the consequences of an unilateral announcement of the independence of the province.
It says particularly to fear a " dominant effect " in a region still debilited by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this doesn't mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs to the Security Council, where its Russian alia has a veto right.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only one solution in the See of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, " had stated the Serb Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
" These negotiations have been due to two years.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council. "
At the journalists, Fat日 Sedjiu had answered that " Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status ", adding that any unilateral statement of independence from the Albanian would be " in concertation with the O.O.A.
Bush launchs an agreement between Israelites and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference, on Thursday to Maryland, that the Israelites and the Palestinians were finally agreed on a common statement.
The Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to establish negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive regulation of 60-year-old age between his two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a "pacific treatment" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle " the terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end their colonization activities, Bush stated, recalling both parts of their obligations regarding the peace that they accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House underlined that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided by Abbas would " conclude a peace treaty that would solve all issues, without prejudice, including central issues. "
This name includes the three main problems of the litigious point between the Israelites and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestinian, the status of Jerusalem and the happiness of the Arabic repositories expelled from their homes during the conflict of 1948.
Taking the word after the American President, Abbas insisted on coming negotiations to be "global and advanced" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, quoting " Jerusalem, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
On its return to the court, Olmert committed the future negotiations to be "direct and continuous" and to "a effort to end them in the 2008 course".
Bush fixed at the end of 2008 the end of its " vision of two States " of Palestinian and Israeli cohesion.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved an emphasis in this sense of Bush before he decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endowed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel the peace in turn to their retreat from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including Jerusalem of East.
Polis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects ", Prince Saoud considers in his Arabic periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police is not responsible.
What exactly happened, last Sunday?
As each time in this type of events, official versions and sounds are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
The first elements of the investigation of the French National Police General Inspection (IGPN), a police car was on Sunday, shortly after the 17th street Louisa-Miguel, Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and it was at 40-50 km/h, without giratory, " explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki mark, "not approved, or not authorised to hold in the public way " (read below) and driven by two young without casks, he was " to all gas ".
"He overcome the police car on the left, after an incompletion of the cedar, the step to the dee," the police needs.

"Let us go down later, with my neighbor who was in the hospital, to reanimate them, account this testimony.
There was nothing to do. "
Then he saw "a completely disappointed police, who was kidding.

This calculation takes into account the unnecessary pregnancy (24 %) as well as the badly planned or inconsistent births.
Today, more than one pregnant of each three (36 %) is not expected today, a study conducted by the National Demography Studie Institute (Ined), 40 years after the vote of the Neuvirth law which is liberalious is the contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account the unnecessary pregnancy (24 %) as well as the badly planned or inconsistent births.
Different contraception methods such as pile or sterilet still present a fraction of 5 % to 6 %, estimate Ined.
The liberalization of the contraception, however, allowed a better "foundity domain ", is the institution that notes that the use of the pile between 20 and 44 years has passed from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight births of each ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple of each five and if possible for the primavery, a season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
spectacular reparation on the space station
There will be more than seven hours of work in the space at the astronaut Scott Parazynski and its stationary companions of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular reparation of a slow and indispensable solar panel for the continuation of the citizenial activities of the station.
A risky outcome that compulsed the records due to its duration, from the distance from the habitated modules, from which it was imagined, the astronautes' instruments to perform the reparation.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronautes had released the Harmony Launch module, a cylindric cross-partial part to take the European and Japanese scientists soon (see enquadrated).
This module is a type of landscape for laboratories modules.
But it must be able to provide them in electricity.
The second task of the tripulation was, therefore, to move a power production module with solar panels weighting 17,5 tonnes, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After it has moved, the tripulation emphasizes the reorganization of the solar panels of the module with an envelope of 76 metres.
And it's where one of the panels, which appear as awards, has been harmed in a few or less than one meter by a cab that was attracted.
The display has been stopped to do not hurt the panel anymore.
The astronautes, who began to perform a control output from the Discovery Launcher, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to characterize at the end of the 30 meters length of the telediriged arm added to the station to perform the reparation.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" (space shop) of Nasa.
High, resistant, very accommodated, has the very developed tower and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for "operating" the solar panel "heritage".
After inspecting exactly the damage, he selected the fatal cab and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had helped him the second " spacewalker " who had stayed near the air cluster and, from within, by other astronautes such as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the tribe.
The tool that uses, a hokey minibast enveloped with isolator to avoid electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundreds of turns, has been designed and "chapped" by the astronautes on the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely deployed before making the inventary of its instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday after the afternoon, the astronautes had benefited from a middle of rest before today, seven astronautes returned from the Discovery lanceer to return to the Planet on Wednesday.
The EADS Title Sanctioned in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently dismissed in the Paris Board, after the Defense and Defence Group has announced that it must cost between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros in order to deal with the A400M retractions.
EADS loses 4 % to 21.96 euros currently in the Paris Board.
The group has been binding to review its prevision of the operational result for 2007 in response to the losses generated by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which adjusts the inevitable flight of the plane.
The cost to pall the delay taken in the delivery of military transport aircraft, announced in October, is " between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus ", announced the European EADS Master House.
Because of these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the exploitation result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results in the next Thursday, adding without any further encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new loads is coherent with the six-month delay.
Remember that the operational result of EADS was 86 % in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to the retraits of another programme, the very brutal A380 carrier.
Initially, the group provided a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The selection of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the outcome of the urns: the Russians will be able to choose massively for the party of President Poutine, United Russia.
Confirming its aspiration to stability, even the author, after a very limited campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin has now directed a television message to the electors on public chains, already registered but whose content is stored secretly.
It makes it as a leader of the list for the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin game whose victory is manifesting an aplastant.
Yesterday, the president did not leave anything transparency by receiving foreign ambassadors, he was happy to deliver a new load against the accused injection O.E. - its pre-illusion theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, without incidents," he added.
If the opposite is, we're very far from the truth.
Declare a campaign missing by pressure.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there is no "never had so swimming elections, even at the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of the manifestations of the last week, the former campaign in the world of Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days of prison for illegal manifestation, is visited by his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
After these legislative elections, there are two more open questions:
Who will happen to Poutine at the president?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first vacation of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to meet.
Selected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot request the third consequent mandate.
Then no successor comes.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the majority of the parliamentary and of the very powerful Russian party that would choose the Government and the President?
Anyway, in legislative elections such as presidential elections, the outcome power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet man, they don't feel owners of their destination," appreciates the Sociolog Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
History Nikolai Kopossov, from the State University of San Petersburg, remonts far far away: civil society was spent in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the spirit of the community was rejected by the training of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Poutine restored the model of a parental state, perfectly accepted by the population, since this new patriarch has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic disastrous, " states Mary Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " rejected their own will to personal responsibility " of whom they had shortly proved after the URSS extent.
"Why to reflect? "
The phenomenon plays all social levels, including the world of matters.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 Governors (of each 85 of the Russian regions) lead the local lists of the United Russia.
The newly imported freedoms of the O日e are often synonyms of chaos, such as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians will not vote for the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year Professor: "Why to reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why do they change them? "
A Hard Memory
After more than 60 years of confidence, the Nazis files of Bad Arolsen, which describe the destinations of 17,5 million victims of hitlerian regime, are in free access.
The 47 million files, stored over 27 km of stationers at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not only advisable for a "human" end, meaning individually and nominally, at request of an ancient victim or of their right-makers.
The eleven States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to the searchers and historyers.
Since the ratification process of this Agreement has been completed by all States, opening is effective since yesterday.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The access of historicals to Bad Arolsen will be allowed to search " particularly on the movements of prisoners, the population of the fields and the health status of the forced workers ", explains Reto Meistern, director of these files managed by the International Commission of the Redz Roja (CCR).
Even recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to opening the public of these nominative documents due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like homosexuality supposed or mental handicap of certain deportation victims.
The records of the concentration fields or arrest orders established by the Gestapo have been gathered after war at a practical end: find the deported or undertaken farmers in the obligation work and, possibly, bring them a test of their intervention to open the way to their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent asalariers treat tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the Scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen revises a limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect these documents," Professor Wolfgang Benz said in 2006, director of the Antisemitism Centre at the Technical University of Berlin.

UMP and NC parties refuse to review the proposals of the PS party on acquisitive power
The UMP and New Centre were refused to discuss articles of the proposal of socialist law on acquisitive power, which is equal to a depreciation of the text.
Inscribed in a "nick" socialist (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a decade of measures adopted on Thursday by the national PS Office, including the increase of 50% of the overseas for employment, the reinstallation of the TIPP (inland for oil products), a fluent transport, or the restrictions of the acquirers.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting has been raised at the end of the general debate that has made place to exchanges, sometimes living, between most and opposition at some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on the acquisitive power.
PS leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that its group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft rectification funds reviewed by the A©a next week.
A new festival comes to light
Following numerous sounds about creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promotor/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Federal Republic of the British Manufacturer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is a honour to work with a person who inspired, not at least, the current movement of the festivals in America ", confided Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the festival Lollapalooza of Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a steady destination for the camping.
The festival should have placed from 8 to 10 August in a private farm of 500 acres at approximately 40 minutes of Philadelphia.
Another time known under the name of Mean Fiddler, director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the address of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which takes about 80 000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then in 2006, the Festival Republic created Henham Park Festival Latitude in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-propriator, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licence concession and organizational tasks of Glasstonbury Festival, which can now reach up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glasstonbury of " most inspiring action " to which he has never assisted, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a festival of European style.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia," supports Charlie Jones.
" We were negotiated with the city and the Commission was motivated and entusiasmed by this project.
Unfortunately, we are in low-categorical policies due to the current administration, Charlie Jones follows.
"Fortunately, we could discuss Melvin Benn and prepare us to create a magnifival on a site that lastly happens to Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park of Chicago, after being dismarked in the festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both agencies registered the respective brutal income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals have place in urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a campaign festival, while ours are more effective in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge both forms, on the other hand, to put a campaign festival in the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is more or less a half road between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the college, supports with enthusiasm the celebration of this action," says Charlie Jones.
This last refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but it is very interesting to allow investment in such age and to cover a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life. "
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer of this festival is "very big", such as the 80 000 people of the Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been released to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of being under pressure.
"Vineland will have the rock sabor, but the music will be variabled there, with the hope of drawing any sort of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His companions of C3, who received the Price Top Indegat Promoter from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal is in front of Terminator
It's not easy to attach Hollywood film plates to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator is opposed to that...
This delegated mission is part of the delegated functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, declares the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to competite with the "Governator"?
"I have to be guardian, it's the industry who decides where he goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our paper is offering those who will judge the best, "says.
The road to the festivals
At present, Denis Turcotte's priority is, however, the promotion of the cinema here.
The carrier to the Okares is started.
All the festivals of the Costa O≤al, which are Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present cheese films, give them value and ensure that the performers are interviewed.
The Dark Age had a good picture at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in a portfolio to Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four lengths and four cortometers to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Are you going to open the end of the year in the bottle? Experts divided by the 'subpresse' crisis.
In less than five weeks to dismiss the closure of the exercise, investors already break their hands expecting that the traditional rally comes to the end of the year.
However, this year, experts have not so clearly that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "from the statistical view, the December in the bottle is likely to have a positive behaviour.
However, previsions should not be made based on statistics, even because in the present context, uncertainties are in the markets at least in the short term."
Although they are not partidaries that the road bottle in the last weeks of the year, these experts point that "the bursatile market is supported by the existence of liquidity, intended to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed rent, affected by the running effect to quality values both in long and short traces".
Thus, they believe that the bottle will have a more lateral behavior, not except volatility "on all because the impact of the decline of the types of Fed is not known, given the high level of crushed and the risk of stimulation of inflationist pressures."
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI sales in Spain, matches that it's not a good time to adventure to say that it's going to be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joy," the expert assured.
Ibex has lost approximately 4% from the maximum marked on 8 November when the Ibex closed at 15,945,7 points.
Not all experts have this negative vision yet.
Juan Solana, an analysis of Intermoney, believes Ibex 35 could close the year closer than the 16.000 points thanks to the repository of portfolio and traditional contributions to pension plans that are produced every year in these days.
However, the expert demands that things will be something different this year since it believes that the rally will be developed in the second week of December, after the Constitution's pool.
The analysis does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an analysis of Inversis Bank, appreciates that we are near technical levels and "that we could see a reboot of the § that could be impulsed depending on the news that come from the United States on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analysis believes that these are positive.
Analysts are in accordance with the time to choose the values that will be responsible for bringing Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, of Intermoney, that "This year touchs the big values."
The expert would include the portfolio to the two large constructions and to some builders "for when the date comes, the sector is very carrying."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Bank, ensures that the outcomes will come from the hand of the industry and industry.
Constructors can also benefit from this rally, if they are given.
"Acs has several months to restore positions and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC continue their way," explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales at the season of ship sales.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do so very well, although in this case there is no much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two times in December has been a low month.
The authentic end-year rally lived in 2003, exercise in which bursatile markets came out of the crisis caused by the painting of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December registered a replacement of 6,68%.
It should be considered if 2007 is the fifth year of profits (for the present Ibex has increased 8,36% from January) and if it can be able to account with its end-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Sabbath
Popular has decided to renew a lot of his offices.
In total, 200, Spain's most commercial areas.
These Offices, which will operate under the Popular Max Mark, represent a great change for it.
Also for the rest of the Spanish Property, since it is the first group that is determined to give the shot to appeal in the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30 a.m., and open the Sundays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 a.m.
Another group who has also repeated in several occasions who wanted to expand the hours of their offices, BBVA, has not yet been decided to pass.
Meanwhile, it is going to conclude a agreement with the syndicates to close 75% of their offices on the Sabbaths, instead of opening one afternoon, even though not publicly.
The results of the experience of Popular will be decisive in order to point to or not other initiatives to the trade timers.
Exactly this is the goal that continues Popularity with the project.
Capture the particular customers that move through these areas to perform their purchases, pimes, autonomes and trades from the selected streets to open.
It wants to have these 200 open offices in all Spain in about 18 months, because they are not new openings but the remodelation of existing.
For this purpose, the Property will modernize the branches already in commercial areas, adapt them to the profile present by customers of the different streets.
In this way, the enlargement of the hours is associated with a different concept of the branch space and a new, more current design with more colorful colors.
The trade responsibility, Angel Rivera, ensures that this resistance is not a great investment, although a greater personal contract, since there is about six employed locally at eight or nine.
The offices, which will even count spaces so that pimes can be gathered there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, explains Angel Rivero.
The branch offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Don's and the Grand Via de Madrid have been selected, and it seems clearly, se 日 Rivero.
Popular account currently with 2.500 branches.
And other 60 operating under the Worldcredit mark, specialized in immigrants, also with very large hours, which even open on Sundays and Festivals.
In these places of PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices are counted with a large abanic of non-financial products for their sale.
"We don't want to competite our customers," says Rivero.
Currently, they have reached an agreement with Telephone to sell mobile, with external staff to the air.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the value in Boss of its Rival Antena 3
We got it.
With that phrase, he expressed his satisfaction in yesterday, Paul Vasile, delegated adviser of Telecinco, to the end of the market, when he found that the string leading was duplicating the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect emphasized his joy: 'is what I suffer, not because we have grown more, but because we have lacked less,' she was.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'We have fallen less'.
Fine television yesterday with a progress of 2,54%.
That winning is the loss of our 15,66% years old.
The value in Bolsa of the company controlled by Mediaset (52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) is thus reached by 4.488,88 million euros, and Bloomberg's data are available.
Its rival Antena 3, which last night was 1,52% and collected a 40.5% lower since January, costs half 2,193,46 million.
The value of the other cotted communications companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million Prisa (Finth Day editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
If Vasile is, the comparison with Antena 3 should be that we are talking about two similar companies.
The related fact is how much we are to do, on the same market, to what cost and how we renew it in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that this year was intended to be converted into the first television chain to over the 1.000 million brutal public incomes, Giuseppe Tringali, delegated adviser of Telecinco and Public Spain, the branch managing the publicity of the group.
In order to make this announced data, the television chain would register this exercise an increase of 3.6% in its publicity factory for 965.4 million of the 2006 exercise.
In its part, the net facturation of Antena 3 increased 1,6% in the first nine months of the exercise (to reach the 4.4 million) while the net TV incomes increased 0.7% (63.4 million).
One of the factors pointing to the analysis for the best related development in Bolsa de Telecinco is the high pay out that he has maintained until now: in 2006, the company presided by Alejandro Echevari shared the 100% of the benefit between its ownists.
Vasile assures that, although it is ready to take the decision, this would varie after purchasing 33% of Endmol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be happy to our employmentists, whom we have already given a value of 33% of the endmol.
Analysts are described, the market gives evidence at this time of certain cansance.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its benefit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009, 7%.
The estimated income growth of 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009 should be explained.
The same signature has reduced Antena 3's profit forecast to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.

The Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
Parallelly to its parliamentary negotiation, which will end today with the vote by the Congress of amendments incorporated to the draft Senate, the Government has undertaken public audience the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both to enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and consent the best legislation to ensure the protection of investors and regularly the activity of the markets to work hardly.
The Mifid, which amends the Market Act, provides for the modernization of financial markets, while enhancing the protection of investor, improves the supervisory powers of the National Values Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new legislation will allow financial advice services to provide both specialized signatures and physical or legal persons and create a new type of financial services signatures (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which are associated with value societys, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
Furthermore, it extended the number of systems for the implementation of financial instruments, so that the multilateral negotiation systems and the internalisation systems of orders will be brought to the regulated secondary markets, which will competite with the current bottle managers.
The Law also requires investment services to provide information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to register all operations that are performing, to facilitate the supervision of the CNMV.
In its past by the Congress Economy Committee, several amendments have been included, including showing that the debts entitled are considered as a "complete" financial instrument given to its high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated with the debt of high risk and high risk hypoteques (subpression).
Moreover, the transposition of the Directive was used to legally eliminate the functions that could be developed by diplomats in Economy and Employment 30 years after the actual decree adopted in 1977 that delimits the professional functions reserved to the economicists.
In its part, the Senate has encouraged the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on asset account, will not require the CNMV authorisation and may provide its marketing services and customer acquisition to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised IPC increases five decades in November, up to 4,1%
This indicator, which serves after Eurostat to include it in the estimation of the inflation in the European Union, provides a progress in how prices in Spain have developed during November.
Its publication answers the Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy to provide equitable data in time and quality for producers in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employer for the Harmonized Consumer Prices Index, but using several statistical modeling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only orientative, therefore it must not be necessary to match the definitive data, which will be known on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at high levels"
The second President and Minister of Economy, Peter Solbes, said that the increase in 4,1% of the IPC in November is a "time number", but at the same time the price will continue at "relatedly high levels" in the next months.
In any case, Solbes has punished in the Congress's passports that "although the number is not good" the difference in Spain's inflation in relation to the monetary union remains the same of the last years.
He also explained that in November it had been less surprise than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high exhibition.
"We had expected a 4% number in return," the Minister of Economics recognised the progressed data today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
Northern Rock depths have fallen over 50% to 12.000 million dollars (16.800 million euros) since he entered in crisis in the mid-September and had to recruit an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, he was acquired of more than 25,000 billion depths, a number that has progressively fallen within two months and a half of its customers' disapproval, and despite the guarantee of the hundred per cent of the money that the Government offered and which will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the § with its financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to take back to a fourth part of the incomes in the British income in the next three years to achieve those 18,000 million dollars remaining until it reaches the goal of 30,000 million.
The group of major Richard Branson, known by its public campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to cost 50 million dollars annually in publicity and market technology to achieve their purpose.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which other three companies participate, as their favorite to save it from the road.
Stopped Totana's colleague by present urbanist corruption trame
The Civil Guarantee has arrested today the first hour of the morning at the current holiday of the Maurice Municipal of Totana (the Popular Party) for its presumptuous relationship with the tram of urbanism corruption this week.
Furthermore, one of the secretariat of the constitution and the police officer of the municipality has been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo substituted the last May to Juan Morales, the current popular lawyer, and even then the director of the municipality, and that the sources of research consulted by the SER Cadena could be the 'header' of this trame.
Agencies continue to register municipal dependences and Urbanism advises and do not delay more detentions in the next hours.
Moreover, the letter of Juan Morales, the main suspicious of the tram of urbanistic corruption at the beginning of this week, has been introduced.
As Ireland reported the SER Cadena, the lawyer of the lawyer ' −ar' Juan Morales, therefore, stopped from Morales' home with important documentation related to the trame.
Moreover, the subject of research, if sources of research, is the assumed coverage of Morales commitments in order to facilitate signing a urbanist convention with a gallean building company to recalculate 200 hectares of land.
For now, there are eight detained people.
Bono accepts to head the PSOE candidate by Toledo and to preside the Congress if they win the
The former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the proposal of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next General Elections and to be President of the Congress in the case that socialists win the General Elections.
Thus, the secretary of the PSOE Organization, José Blanco, and the Bono's own, after the midday he held at the federal seat of this party with Zapater.
The Executive Boss has justified the offer to the former minister because "the best" in the political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he pointed out that "yes" seems to be the candidate of the socialist group to preside the Congress if socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would be appointed as President of the Congress to Manuel Marín, which published last 15 November its decision to not present to the next general elections and to leave its carrier in the active policy to be dedicated to combating climate changes in the university area.
The former Minister has recognized that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting to return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He also noted that, as the citizens know who is the economic President if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who the Congress will preside in a "transparency Act".
If it reaches the charge, Bono expects to convert the Camera into "the house of respect and not the insult or crying" and to "seem more like the citizens".
" Sometimes lamentates it seems that the only local in Madrid where it is not possible to speak quietly and with sociousness is the Congress, the President of the Government, at a certain time, interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
She also had words of honor for her current president, Manuel Marín and "he's good to do" and she didn't want to see her job again to not fall in what, if she was not indicated, her opposers could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change submits immigrant persecution to both the skeptics of its predictions and to those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is required to demonstrate iron coherence.
And another leader of the movement that is the President of the Government as Zapater and believes that this fight is more important than the Islamic terrorism and is even proposed to sign a "new agreement with the planet".
This suggestion requires you to explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government, have contributed decisively to Spain's incompliance with the EU in Kioto.
Who are responsible for the incompliance, in which sectors has been produced and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Moreover, it requires you to explain with the maximum clearness to the Spanish which are the measures you will take to breathe the climate change.
What enterprises will be affected, what civil habits should be changed, what individual and collective energy resources we will be obligated to do, what economic consequences it will have.
Or, who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But there will not be any such explanations.
Exactly because it's about to sacrifice and pay.
The measures against climate change, real measures, are inevitable.
Costs, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Even the centimeter of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that has been refused to refuse.
Or, that is to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impacting phrases, Commissions, Committees, Protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this master is so useful for electoral campaigns that does not speak or deny or require, but advocate the mythiness and inspire tenderness.
Every time it is limited to be a very meritly contracting party and does not want us to move into a bicycle or refresh with the abanic.
Stops the college and head of the local police of Totana by a presumptuous tram of urbanist corruption
The Civil Guardia has arrested the chairman of the Mursian Locality of Totana, the "emerging" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretariat of the Ayunting and a hostal business for possible urban crimes, have reported today sources of research.
The building was arrested in his home and has been posted to the Conscience, in which its dependencies are now with many agents, who have also accused the Urbanism Conceality and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Aviation Sweet.
These three arrests are summarized to the six months past in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in a operation relating to the recalification of more than 2 million hectares of Russian ground in urbanizing, so that the Gallega Nuaria company is built 4.000 residents, after payment of illegal commitments during the past legislation.
Moreover, two other persons were not arrested but were placed in the summary, instructed by the Court of Justice No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detentions have passed to the legal provision today.
The sources have been informed, the former director of Totana and today the autonomous parliamentary of the PP, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
Moreover, the former woman, owner of an immobiliary agency registered today in Totana, has been imputed, as the current girl of the former Regior, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, a lawyer and businessman who lived in Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as Paul José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency integrated in the citated Group, and at the same time that the suborns would have been performed.
Research runs by the Operative Central Unit of the Civil Guarantee (UCO), whose agents, as well as arrests, practiced eleven records, the majority of enterprises related to prisoners and sites in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Roses (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a very known bird-product company in the region, which could have acted as a mediator.
The Nuaria Group was the responsible for developing what would be the greatest residential full of the murder municipio of Totana, which would suggest the construction of more than 5.000 residents, a golf field and two hotels with "spa".
The company purchased in Totana 2,2 million square metres of land which were recalified and its project would have to duplicate the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to immobiliary promotion; Conycase, which manages the vigourous parkings of the Croatian Streets, Venezuela and the Place of Fernando the Catholic; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on promotion, sale and installation of elements of construction.
What happens
1st
If it seems to them, we'll leave the book of the Month, to see if there are other "premiology" and other competences.
I'm already getting something.
Life is a change, people.
Of course, you are invited to offer invents.

Our Finnish composite helps us to make this comment on yesterday in the most important period of Finland (in fact, in the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what they published on 18 November, the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the signature of Philosophia has gone to the public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The guilty of death, a bachillerate student, quoted in his messages the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser for Filosofia Allocation, Pekka Elo, was from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat journal that teachers adopt a critical responsibility to Platon and suggested that studying Nitzsche is not in the obligational course of Filosofia in the institutions."

A colleague provides information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of crimes on the Internet:
A. The song of a song would be criminal with six months a year.
However, if you stole disks by value less than 400 euros in the tent, it is simply considered missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you stole in the tent up to 1.000 euros, the currency is already criminal, but the penalty remains lower than the tax (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you stole a car and return it 40 hours later, the pen continues to be lower than the of the (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in compact exchange.
Participation in a tumultuous river has three months a year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penal of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. The sexual accusation in the work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, is article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-guarded films and without authorisation is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to smaller (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague's in the truth, someone's going to the hand, a very long hand.

My heading doctor leaves me one of your articles on rare research titled: 'The money produces brain activations, especially if the others receive less.'
Or, the feelings that generate the payment of the workers depend on what the companions win.
The study has been conducted through magnetic tomographic reasons at the Bonn University, and the results are published in the last number of Science.
Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Institute Live&Brain, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion fails."
The researchers noted that if they both had received the same payment, the activation would be moderate, but if one received the double, the activation would be greater.
I don't know if so much science would require this conclusion.
The tax of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been eight years of implacing the war criminals of the Balkans from the Penal Court of Justice for the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Its mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla will go with an aggregate sabor, because the main responsible for the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8000 muslim boss died - the ex general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbish leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be free.
His names are in that list that takes the documental of the executor of his Marcel Schüpbach, 'The list of Carla' (2006, not stretched in Spain) which, with the rate of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss fiscal held in New York to guard the fugitives and press the governments involved to stretch the circle.
What's the sure I'm supposed to be?
The car insurance, which covers the driver before potential unexpected, provides an important expenditure that will depend on various factors such as age, sex, anti-eighty sheep, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use it, among others.
Keep the car is just the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the suitable car assurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurance.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed in order to be responsibility for the obligation of paying the refunds in case of training.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is set out in the light of various factors, such as age, sex, anti-eighty sheep, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or the use of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the most likely to suffer a accident is more than a quota to be abonned.
It is therefore why both older than 25 and women must pay lower premiums, since statistics reflect that they have a smaller non-estrality due to their debt.
Furthermore, by putting out the accounts, companies have concluded that married people have less accidents than sole drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of percency.
Increasing frequency increases the probabilities.
There are many variables that guarantees take into account at the time of fixing the price of the premium.
It is therefore that the driver must well study the situation to choose the assurance of car which is better adjusted to its profile.
We'll expose the most significant variations here at the time of choosing one or another type of security, so that you, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the security, offer you a reasonable price.
Youths less than 25 years are inconvenient at the time of achieving a guarantee to a suitable price, such as the reduced experience in conducting and the anti-measure of the sheep.
Although the ideal to be well safe is a security for all risks, there are other economic options.
The most predicted drivers can choose for a whole risk of franquisy, so they get the coverages of a security to any risk but to a more fair price.
This type of conviction would assume that the customer pays a part of the amount of the teacher.
"The part of the sum of the customer's customer's amount will be eligible according to the value of the premium, which will be higher as lower than the amount," indicates Luis Noguera, the maximum responsible in Spain of First Europe, online security mediator.
Another option is a security for thirds extended, so that the customer will ensure protection from damage caused to thirds, even though not to the caused in his own car.
Furthermore, it would be held by robe, incendie and loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you're less than 25 years old, be careful and avoid the shortcomings as soon as possible, since this will affect bonification, and can reduce the cost of the insurance in the future.
A bonification is a reduction on the basic tariff that holds the company.
On the contrary, a penalisation is a recovery on that basic tariff.
"The bonifications and penalisations will depend on the company and the benefit of it.
If the company has been a good year, it can be allowed to increase bonifications," Noguera states.
In the past 25 years, the drivers have easierly reached an insurance, since the non-estrality is decreased thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommendable is to take a whole risk of franquisity.
"Normally, young people can not use the experience previously acquisied at the time of a accident, even at the time of conduct," assured the director in Spain of the European Company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of conduct, once the 'medium of the news'.
However, if the customer is married but still does not have children, it is preferred to negotiate a security for any risk, even when its economic situation is allowed, it is clear.
In its part, marriages with children are considered by the insurance officers as the public with less non-satisfactory, so the charges will be less.
In this case, the best insurance would be one to any risk of franquisity (in which it may be 300 euros), or, if it is available to a high level of bonification, one to thirds extended from the third year of the vehicle's life.
"They have a more relaxed leadership and have a greater acquisitive power to be allowed to take a greater quantity of franquisity," judge Luis Noguera.
For jubilated is recommended an insurance for any risk of franquisy (including 150 euros), or one to thirds extended when a high level of bonification is given.
It must be said that car security is something important, not only because it covers the driver before the possibility of neighbours, but also because it represents an important expenditure, why it is essential to study the assurance that more we agree is our personal situation.
The Celtic searches for Milan a point that values the eighth
Milan and Celtic are measured this Thursday in San Siro in search of the point they missed to achieve their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions' lift, since the Italians are served to be first and Scotland to judge their classification.
The Italians summarize ten points and have already certified their pass in the fifth day with a empathe in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, receives the Benfica, who has four, not forward.
These two parties of the Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, since Milan has to discuss the World Club World in Japan, where he draws on Thursday 13 in semifinals in search for a place for the end of the 16.
So this group will be closed before the rest and empathe in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better cross in eight.
For a total of Gordon Strachan, it could even serve a disaster to classify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be trusted because the pass is equal to nine points for the Ucrainians, who lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they won (2-0) in the other direct dull.
Thus, the Millennists will try to burn the night to the Scotchs, who believe that they sit on eighth once in the Champions League repository and follow-up, after the campaign was exactly destroyed in that round with a goal of Kaka in the prolongation (1-0) after the 0-0 of the ida.
Waiting for the victory of the "rossoneri" will be the Shakhtar who only values the triunph, in the case that the Celtic losses, both to sit in octaves and to continue in EUFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being the last and without options to follow the maximum European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which EUFA would play.
200,000 people attend in Vancouver at the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver (Canada), at approximately 200,000 spectators, their first turn since they were solved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said a little before they started their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium.
Approximately 20,000 people took the entries to present the concert that included a video in which the history of the group was reported at the end of the 1990s.
The revision and the world tour coincident with the collection of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Vodoo", which publishs EMI in Spain.
The five integrants of Spice Girls went out to the scenario with a bracelet that gave them the husband of Posh Spice, the British footballist David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the public that was aborted by the GM Place, although Victoria's nerves had done it daily before.
At the precedent of the start of the spectacle, Victoria Beckham noted that the British astronomy "he didn't see our clothes, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think about the spectacle."
"Sporty Spice" whose outcome from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the resolution of the fifteenth two years later, also expressed its nervosism during a meeting with the press, two hours before the spectacle beginning.
"It was the clues.
I was nervous but I saw the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm happy to have taken the decision," Chisholm said about the group she solved nine years ago.
The song also pointed out that with time, "the things have been arranged and we love all."
But many things have changed since Spice Girl acted for the last time together in 1998.
For the first time, the CTV television came to Vancouver in a special flight of Virgin Airlines.
When he arrived in the port, he was waiting for a kidnapping army.
Among the five are seven children.
After Vancouver's concert, the group will act in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
They will act in Madrid on 23 December.
New gas fears between Russia and Ukraine
The increased dispute for the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of exporting fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is addressed to Ukraine, so each road between both nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the gas price, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous discussion last year reduced the supplies to the EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ucrainian government and the Russian state, the Monopolean Gazprom owner, trying to agree with the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would cover more Ukraine, since this has been committed to pay a 50% extra in 2008 for the gas from the neighborhood of Turkmenist.
Analysts say that Ukraine may pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the conversations," the Ucrainian Economic Minister Anatoly Kinakh said to the news agency Reʹs.
"The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last large dispute for the gas between Moscú and Kiev, Gazprom cut off the accommodation to Ukraine in January 2006.
This means a fall in exports to Western Europe, which was quickly up to prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supplier.
Russia has the biggest gas reserves in the world, but a good part of it is still not completely developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with the Gas of Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Asia Central.
NHS " must try foreign workers"
The Switzerland NHS needs to control the registers of criminal preliminary staff outside Europe, said a supervisory.
The recommendation of the general auditor Robert Black vino after checking that a foreign doctor was related to the attack on the Glasgow port in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Switzerland NHS has no exact idea of the number of foreign staff with which it is.
However, its report noted other controls that are correctly carried out in a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the amount of foreign staff contracted outside the European Economic Area, based on the attacks on the Glasgow port.
Bilal Abdullah, 28th, a Iraqic doctor of the Hospital Royal Alexandra de Paisley, was arrested in the port after shopping a jeep at the doors of the port's terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted in the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of the assumptions with a bombing car in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks for candidates to ensure that they comply with qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health assembly uses "Disclosure" to carry out criminal controls, the Agency does not have jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the United Kingdom.
The report of the General Auditor recommends, among other measures, that the meetings should comply with the Guide of Crime Records Bureau, which helps employees with criminal controls in many countries outside the United Kingdom.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Switzerland NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but it states that: " Our report refers to the areas that can be improved to ensure that information is necessary in the number of NHS foreign staff."
The President of the BMA, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very small" that pre-employing checks could identify NHS potentials that could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS, but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations were made," he explained.
The Switzerland health authorities declare that they are currently counting with 1.161 foreign people, most of them, doctors and farmers
However, the general auditor warned that the number could be higher, in part because the assemblies have problems to identify which are the employees who are accounting for undefined residence authorisations.
The investigation also found that the test procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glassgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were extensively fulfilling.
This includes passport controls, work permission and qualifications check.
The Switzerland Government is currently revising the pre-employment policy and leadership of foreigners in the NHS.
The Health Secretariat, Nicola Sturgeon, states: "He had a great interest to carry out this work from the terrorist attack of the Glasgow port.
He added that the Switzerland Government, together with health assemblies, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in the update of pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - what they planned to publish in the next month.

Ray Winstone, who has a reputation to play hard, received the premium Richard Jarris for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifteen, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently films the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Cristal Calvary".
Winstone said he was proud of receiving that premium, so appointed in honor by Harris, Camelot star and Harry Potter, dead in 2002.
"They were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was happy to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really a honour."
The prices of the independent cine, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes cineasts, actors and festival organisations.

Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that he arrested 208 militaries of terrorist cells that planned an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks against religious and security forces.
The stational television of the biggest petroleum provider in the world said that one of the cells was planning the mixing.
Simpatizants of Al-Qaeda have assembled a campaign against the local monarch, in association with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
A eighty military cell formed by foreign residents planned an attack on oil installation in the East province, stated the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35.000 effective to protect Abqaiq’s installations, the largest oil plant in the world, after a disappeared attack from Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, quoting a statement of the Ministry of the Saudi Innerior, said that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell leading by a " expert in the mixture", which has entered into the country.
The Minister said that military men had planned the entry against eight projects to the country.
Other 22 of the prisoners were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The Government warned the religious leaders who should be more active to stop the Saudi who travel to Iraq to join as military to Al-Qaeda to fight the allied forces and to support the Government of Shiita Muslim, which is considered hereafter by the most extreme Saudi Sunies.
Al-Qaeda soldiers have the view of many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the real family policy, which dominates the government.
The soldiers - recluded by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, born in Saudi Arabia, to attack the government pro-oue of the country - had a target of residences of foreign people associated with the government, government buildings and energy installations.
"This was a great effort for security forces, since five months of work," said the carrier of the Ministry of the Interior to the State TV.
The arrested also include a "medical cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Muslims that supports violence against the Muslims considered apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of supporting and financial support to military people.
The climate of Venus can give a idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have been a close place for life once, they declared science yesterday.
The data of a European space ship in orbit was shown to the most like a planet of the Earth than it had previously been observed.
Venus is the nearest planet on Earth.
The two planets have the same size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is quite closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had similar conditions as they made from the earth a living planet, now the scientists believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the inver ́ro effect, the erosion of the sun radiations and the lateest solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today, the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to throw the plum and is erosioned by the winds and ray storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, who has studied the planet for a year, offer a panorama of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics of the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "There is explaining why the climate in Venus is so different from the earth when two are so similar planets.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scenario where Venus eats as the Earth, perhaps with a living environment a million years ago."
Police decommit "reached uranio"
A kilo of radiactive material, which they declare is an enriched uranio, was decommitted yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police carrier declared that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The efficiency could not confirm whether it was rich uranio but said that it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 dollars star).
Still open
Mitt Romney says it is not worth that presidential candidates answer the questions of a snow mono.
However, the Republican candidates for the Presidency may be accessed to maintain a debate in YouTube, where common and running voters ask questions in video and send them to their diffusion among candidates.
No of the questions presented on midnight 28 November were more ridiculous than the one of the snow mono who asked democrats about climate calamity in the debate of the YouTube Republican Party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party to the elections of the next year.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-patrocinate the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to aspirants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest dedicated to one subject, was focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN requested a group of individual voters that they would be in the dial when they listened to ideas that they would like them: the candidates noted approval steps when the candidates talked with extremist arguments.
The hardest exchange of words in the night was given between Rudy Giuliani, the national pillar, and Mr. Romney, which has been pointered in the crucial issues of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to destroy Romney's reputation because he was mixed with illegal immigration when he was a neighbor in New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former ruler of Massachusetts to contract illegal immigrants to work in his house.
Both responded aggressively when they asked them if any candidate could support a "amnistie" (to allow illegals to regularize their situation and give them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
The smaller candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressist, agreed with the subject.
No one has the word to be appointed candidate, but both are still in the career because they both warned about the issue of immigration before others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates have views: increased monitoring in frontiers, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This subject, with the fear of the toxic players of China and other concerns outside, helps the Republicans to minimize, or minimise, divisions between liberals and Christian conservators.
But the debate was uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had supported the control of weapons in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the input in water should be considered a torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to travel to the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the balena.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's latest question, thanks to his long-term Christian conservatorism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus would be favorable, he ried saying that Jesus was too smart as to be candidate in the elections.
The career is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, coherently with Liberal Ron Paul's funding campaigns, and its claimed statements of the midnight debate.
The two have been out of the fund because the two sides of the party did not agree on the most traditional and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early and convincedly with a winner message on America's size, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from being clear.
Working Dolores
Gordon Brown has decreased another hoo in which he's fighting; but it also occurs.
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
It seems not to have sold influences, neither to exorbitate hotel accounts in Paris, nor to shopping extra marital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a ricain businessman has dismissed contributions to the English laborist government party, more than 650,000 dollars of sterlin (1.3 million dollars) for about four years, using names, and that the party did not charge it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister claimed to call on a choice, insulting the British intellectuality stupidly stated that the opinion investigations did not affect its decision, the hope was that a strong and strong government would provide you.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal democrate leads with growing engine, because the fearful Mr. Brown has passed to be Stalin Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a man in trouble, showed regulatory weakness and poverty in crisis times.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have made business groups together against the Government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data that discovered an unimaginable administrative chat.
A three of the retired generals started a motin in the Lores camera, protesting against the courts in military expenditure: being ministers of armed forces is, they claimed, a middle-time employment.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general worker secretary (and previous complice) has already been released.
Nothing of this means Mr Brown's irrevocable way to output.
Governments can reach a point of inflection after they are found incapable of governing.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they still suspend their incredulity when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve the things, which is not long ago, this suspension is more: the public officers begin to fail; the office ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is putting on the defence and does not focus.
In one case, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because, in contrast with other political leaders, it cannot be defended by argumenting that it is new.
Although I wanted to refuse Tony Blair, he was his superior lady.
The problems of Northern Rock and the registration of authority are related to the decisions that Brown made as a cancer of the error.
And even when it is not directly involved in the contracts of Blairish - or "effective for partners", the research on the financing of political parties - the voters may assume if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The tables are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, neither has been staffed right.
And the remedy, even though painful, is to do what, naturally, the Stalinists trends of Mr Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scenario of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charity gifts, says that he does not want public recognition for his favor.
This may be so, but the decision doesn't take it.
The laws against anonymate for major political contributors are clear and there is for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said to know about Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, obviously will be Jon Mendlesohn, head of funds recovery, who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown is not yet involved: there is nothing he would suggest that he knew of these actions, although the payments was made after he took the office control in June.
By the time the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
It has been quick to condemn its party for violation of the law, but it is diluted in making decisions by a family matter, a research committee on the matter - which is, in a good measure, by a judge and a visitor.
In this case, morality is not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
Moreover, there are other things that Mr Brown should do, as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Commission of Normas in the Public Life, because he hasn't had one since six months, and he must also be pressured by a genuine reform of the financing of parties.
This will require a strong cooperation work of workers with the Tories, and maybe a refusal to the special financial situation with the syndicates -your measures for a party as Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisting facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the investigations; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to the victory is to act with an inevitable probability and a strong competition.
Tiburones cards
The crisis of hypoteques is infectioning the American market for credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some darsal wallets are not emotionated around.
Today, when the American residence market is in crisis, depreciers have their views on the market of credit cards in the country.
Analysis in Goldman Sachs calculates that losses in credit cards can reach 99 million dollars if the hypotech crisis subprimes other forms of consumption credits.
Accounting signs are already seen.
There is a increase in card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of salts that have not been amorted or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that he took 1.4 million charges in its financial business to the American consumer, partly due to the deficiency of card providers.
However, it's very early for the panic.
Morociousness and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a currency agency, the third trimestre of 3.89% crime rate was almost a percentage point under the history average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American penalty law of the people (2005) has occurred to a brush falling in the requests of cebra, which at his time represents a great loss of credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of morocy) would be growing again, or may occur that the conditions for the providers were threatening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of its debts pay consumers each month.
And confidence in credit cards and values supported by assets is quite strong, despite paralyzing in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research signature, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection channels of the crisis between hypoteques subprimes and the market for credit cards are certain: consumers like to load debts to credit cards now that credit cards are losing.
However, credit card holders view the liquidity flow more than active values, so that the prices falling are not necessarily a change in the accred capacity of the providers.
They can even work to advance the people.
The incentives for consumers to continue to amortise hypoteca decrease whether properties are less valuable than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card debt is up in the list of priorities.
Card facilities may also respond quickly and flexiblely to the difficult conditions such as hypotech facilities, changing types of interest or modifying creditor salts.
This in theory should reduce the risk of a quick retaking of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and evaluate all the loans again," says Gary Perlin, Chair of Capital One Finance.
If a repeated effect of subpression on the credit cards market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If the house prices are lower and a credit contraction moves America to receipt, the Indud industry will be a stronger future.
You need to keep watching those darsal walls.
British bankers declared guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were judged for their responsibility in frauds with the former head of the financial office of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were declared guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocents of seven fraud charges for being deceived with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to be rich at the side of employees.
They were sent to judgment in January.
But during the audience before the judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. I was sentenced as a guilty of fraud collusion.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Switzerland PLC group in the Royal Bank, became slave in Greenwich Natwest for the additional procedures which were two years.
In the United States, its case marks the end of an investigation launched after Enron's deterioration in 2001.
Initially, bankers' charges had been warned in 2002 to Fastow that it was a goal of a government research on Enron's fall.
The accusation against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tres" - states that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his older assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron society controlled by Fastow, which was the artificial of a thousand frauds in Enron, which helped his caught spirit in the cheap.
In 2002, the interests of the subsidiary in zero were valued, but the three British knew that it would be worth up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary interest in $1 million.
The bankers paid to Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
The accusation is, Fastow represented Enron, because the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers covered 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow was sentenced by two conspiration charges in Enron's colapse.
The three British were arrested three months later.
Fastow is being executing a 6-year-old sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is playing a 3-year-old pen and one month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers should pay 1 million dollars required to live in the United States while the judgment was celebrated.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies of the nation, stated in December 2001 after years of trials in accountability, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business successful.
The colapse made billion jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive boss, Jeffrey Skilling was charged for the last year by its roles in the colapse of the company.
Skilling is complying with a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's condemnation for conspiration, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died from an attack to heart last year.
Down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to flight directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts in $54 million.
But this is a small expenditure for some of the Russian riches.
"He has capacity to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was acquired of the Gulfstream cabin on Friday in the Millennium Firry, a four-day consumption orgy held in a center of events in the neighborhood of the capital.
Besides Gulfstream, other 200 lujo providers had installed their exhibition stands, waiting for the new Russian addicted to any kind of products, from caoba-artesoned jates to the diamond-incrossed car parlies, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks carefully on an anarranged Porsche in the neighbor's stand."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nick and calderly compared to us," he said.
" After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
The Russian capital seems to Dallas when he was in apogeo.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some awaited Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, older professor of the Centre Davis for the Russian and Eurasian University of Harvard.
"Like the Saudians of the 70s and Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are working as the biggest consumers and expenses of the world."
The most luxo marks in the world are searching for their part of the past.
In the other place of Moscow, this week will be conducted a conference on the luxe industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the President of LVMH, to exchange ideas about how to sell luxe goods in markets such as Russia.
(The Conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, property of the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 million dollars that make a total of $282 billion, is the list of Forbes of the richest people.
Furthermore, the two-party riches include 103.000 million Russians whose money comes to $670 billion, a study of the development of personal riches in the former Soviet Union, written by the Economy and Financial Research Centre, a local thinking.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15,8% of the Russians were under subsistency level.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - and therefore we're all here," says Nicole Marais, a representative of sales and marketing of David Morris, the Londry Joyer.
She was sitting at the ferry for the first time at the Russian market distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"The women are impec'e prepared and men are very worth."
Visiting the dinner night on Sunday, dressed afternoon, two raw goods agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaries.
"I was looking at the cars and I am going to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, which reeled off the design cart that used as a veteran carpet dishing with Joan Rivers.
The ferry has a goal to attach the new riches, the type of buyers that would be ready to stay several hours in a storage that mixed marks from Cadillac Scalades, platino cortaplasma, hedges of Mövenpick, based bathroom tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund tee bones.
The general public can buy 30 euro bottles ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in what mark is the most costous and the best," Mr. Gijrath said, who was patrioticly sitting in a stand of the Netherlands real porcelanas Delft, before a wall size rebuilding of a painting of burnt, made of blue clothed by hand.
Of course, the Russians are more interested in the "bling-bling".
In fact, the sellers said that the Russian rich of more trade (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their pleasure from the logos calling to the marks of limited editions, which would not be exposed to a commercial feriation.
Nevertheless, several thousands of people: millions in reality, millions of tourists or millions, are filled with packs every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the ferry last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of the King Koil beds, said that he sold two cocktail systems of $70,000 each, seed facts, cashmira and cocktails of gold.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, acquired of sales for A1 Moto, company who equipped high gamma cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said that the company had sold the anarranged Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian million.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, companion that changes lujo cars for special requirements, said that he had sold three car parkings in a form of chain bracelets for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55.000 each.
He showed the reporter a car road, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with incrossed rays of Swarovski color cristals, so it would be like a rulet road.
The cost: $22.000 for four roads.
"The Russian millionary who wants avestruz wheels or a retraction of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive on those wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep the car in his garage, with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian states that the expression "Russian billion" does not mean ability, given the price oil of the immobiliary properties.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a million, at least in the paper if it's not effective," he said.
"There are more than what you think."
Those who were not millionary could at least finish to be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management signature.
The company made four red phone cabins (britannian style) filled with billet piles of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing officer of the company, said that his team had printed 500,000 billets for the Millionary Fire.
The visitors stopped taking money piles, asking their friends to take photos with their mobiles while resting over a lot of money, or a few million embols.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a million," says Karryev.
The "chapuza" surgery could be caused by a death in New Jersey
It was the preceding day of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked at the "A little more healthy" Restaurant window and saw how a ambulance went up by White Cape Cod, two more lower doors in West Scott's avenida.
Soon, there appeared a car from the police patrol.
And then another.
"And I saw the ambulance up," said Mr. Livingston, Restaurant supervisor, that midnight.
"There was when I knew someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, who was 41 years old, assistant of the Department of Newark Police.
Now researchers are going to determine whether she died due to a procedure made by an unapproved plastic surgery, which is not yet identified by the police, but works at the 212th Av. West Scott's house.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicological test, although the results are not available until a few weeks, it will help to solve the mysterious death that he has just to the top lines of Newark's police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"He was loyal, worked and tenez," Mr. McCarthy said on Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"He was my guard."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ex officer of the Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Bear Control Committee, and left two sons of 14 and 11 years, and a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, the portrait of the Union of the Court of Justice, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died in the course of an unapproved chirurgical procedure.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Walsh.
"It's a current research."
The authorities said that they came to the house around 3 P.M.
From 21 November and found Mrs. Arroyo in a sofa.
It was dead in the place.
More than one week, and the authorities have said little about their research or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh couldn't say if Mrs Castro was asked by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine what part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs Castro's house, where a marched rose is located on the front side of the house, and a dealmate ladra on the back.
A tambor a ́ tagged as "ethyl vainillin" - used as suit for food and perfumes wallet - was located at the door of the cup, on the side of a door that drives to the sothan.
Two mountain bicycles are cut off of hangs on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he came to Newark after 25 years in the police department of New York, Mrs. Arroyo was an inestimable help to know the new island city and its rude political culture.
"He would say, "You must watch with this or that," he said.
"He was always here when I was, and also when I didn't.
It's pregnant."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cover the taxes to resume the Bolsa
The actions hopped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market would hope that the Federal Reserve would calm the credit conditions to interest rates, which were increased with the quietly recommended comments of the President of the United States Central Affairs.
The balls were located in London, New York and Europe after Donald Kohn, two of Ben Bernanke, the president of the reservation, declared that politicians should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continuous pressure of the financial markets.
In a clear effort to quiet the markets in the middle of growing credit balls, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence was "in part invested by the improvement in the market at the end of September and in October".
If the trend continues to grow up, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for immobiliary and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital in the United States markets and to make further shorts of the type of interest, to stabilise credit conditions.
The comments also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the US economy, such as the sales of houses that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were emphasised by a warning of Bear Stearns, which will cut 650 jobs, which is equal to 4 % of its total work hand, in a global reduction of costs to compensate the loss of investments in the sub-premity of the United States.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter in London, where 1,500 people are employed.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones ascended to 331 points, or 2.55%, closed to 13.289.40, while the large S&P 500 increased 2.65%.
In London, FTSE 100 ascended 165.5 points, or 2.7%, closed to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion sterlines to the value of the first British first order companies.
The German Dax increased 2.6%, and CAC40 from France was over 2.3%.
On the other hand, the reapparition of the credit pressure on the markets was stressed after a strong request in a submission of funds at three months of the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European trade rates at 4.7%, the highest tariff since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the action of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject additional funds on the value markets in London was stressed by the credit and the loan rates for three months "Libor" between the British Property, which was higher since September, of 6.59%, after a constant extent from 12 November.
England takes the requests of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each one so hard as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And no one is less important before the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election that is in prest - with at least that special title, is here to help Peter Moors, the trainer, and Michael Vhaltan, the Captain, to decide; and also because the Hugh Morris' office, director of England, is beginning to fill offers to become a national selector, and if not, one part of time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth battle place will be unfortunate, but the life often is unjust and the sport is also.
It is not easy to take what a man does on the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes because of the lack of happiness more than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket, the choice is difficult, because judgments are always being subjects.
Is it the right time to get Bopara up?
Is it just for Shah if he does it?
The same question could be made in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, would have been promoted at the table: there is only a place for one of them.
Who should say what's a good level for a cricket player, unless you give you the opportunity to slow down or go to the next chance?
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the same time to take a "wicket" and a battery to gain opportunities to change the order if you want to have an impact as a player some day.
But capturing the eye of the electors is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison is declared for "fit and good" as the wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 carriers for everyone to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but they both had their high moments and could wait more than these.
Shah or Bopara games at the stadium of Asgiriya can be only a question of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it may mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every test and did it well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful carriers, but Paul Collingwood was fighting to set up at the same time who came to become an important player, and despite noting a double hundred against ́a’a, it may be still underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, VÍHAN and Moores, after a more discussion at the today's session at the stage of Asgiriya, will follow their conservation instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience for the exhaustion of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, it is a valuable and valuable test of 88 principles in Bombay, 32 centuries of the first class in front of only 6 of Bopara, who is in 22 years older, and has excellent precedents against the spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten carriers in his two tours in May against West Indias in the test in Lords, his house as Middlesex player, and that caused a immediate choice when Vhalthan recalled his place for the next meeting, it seemed to have taken from his "batting" something of the one that was in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team is happy to live in swords.
He takes himself for nothing in the cricket field and his own was resumed as when he was running his vehicle in an exhibition for the English car patrocinator, Volkswagen.
He suffered less important lessions and, probably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (patrocinated, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his team companion looking at the distance, to say with exciting: "Have you seen that?".
Bopara is the best player, it includes his pass balance to have effects on its games that seem to satisfy it, because it battles with confidence and ability.
Choose the right man is one thing, choose the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of the selection.
My inclination would be giving Bopara your opportunity, which doesn't mean that Shah doesn't overlay, as the tea sheets suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Business bring back to work - and fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqian repositories in Syria began to come to Bagdad yesterday, expelled the exhibitors who remained uneffective, without visions and those who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even tried to fight against the soldiers who led them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people from arrival in a official convoy of the Government composed of a twelve buses, the terminal was full of repositories from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," Sabah al-Qubasi, Sunite doctor.
"I returned today for what I saw in the TV and what I read in the magazines, about what happened in Bagdad and that it's safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, repeatedly repeated to the chitch milician of the religious military Cle ́ Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his people a momentan cease.
Cassim to Atwani, 38-year-old and professor in Amariyah's sunite area, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew their vision in Syria because the regime does not want the Iraqians working in their country.
His cheese neighbors in Amariyah called him on a phone to tell him that a allianced force from the United States helped Al-Qaeda out of his bastard to the west of the capital, and they urged him to return.
One of the recent arrived in Jordan was the leader of a Sunite and Chita tribe who had been driven from his house in Sleikh to the north of Bagdad, by a granate attack, after he urged citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started a milician anti Al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my companions."
"This is why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many said that they were attached to the growing calm in the capital since the United States groups of "inquired citizens" groups, armed and working in cooperation with the United States military to defend their neighbors.
But many have declared that they have rejected the visa and the lack of money in ́co, where more than 1,3 million Iraqians have been established in the last years.
Salaam al-Samarai, 51 years old and father of three children, voted to the common suspicious among the exiled, which Nouri al-Maliki, the Chiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian Government to impose restrictions to the vices of the repositories to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled from the country because of the sectoral tables of death.
"We were well until Al-Maliki visited Syria and encouraged the government to stop allowing the Iraqs visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunite.
"I can't believe in a government supporting criminals who burned my house after I left it."
A part of the reason for the cease of violence is that Sunites have been exhausted from the Child and ́versa areas, relaxing the pressure.
There is a fear that a swimming oil of repairs will rise to sectoral pressures and start the fight.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in professional training and even through the international orientation of its high schools.
Like in the whole country, the Sardinians do not have only a educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for fifty times to a non-Sarlandian we are not French," that was the ironic moto on himself of the smallest federal state for its fifty-year.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre educational system that in a study of the German Economic Institute (IW) called "pilungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, higher schools per tradition have good relations with neighborhood countries.
Saarbrücken university was founded in 1948 by French.
Even today, students can finish their university career with two or three diplomas.
Therefore, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15,6 per cent.
However, the number of students resulting from Sarre is higher than the average in high schools, and many of them do not have a liar.
"In Sarre, the professional education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, the educational expert in the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than five young people make their bachillerate at the Professional School. This results that Sarre is 7 per cent above the national average.
In contrast, the variety of possibilities for a professional and academic education is very large.
The donation of double careers, regarding the number of populations, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and a growing request, the number of engineering scientists has laid down a third in recent years.
That was why the Sarre Ministry of Education forced the higher schools to make more publicity for specialities in Sciences of Engineering.
" After the first PISA study, we have made some reforms at the general education schools," a portfolio of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the Government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order to start the children before studying the last year of the project called Kita-Jahr, this does not have any costs. Instead, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of students has increased.
The 2003 PISA report was decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But in general, the Sarre did not improve much as other federal states.
In Baviera, students know better calculating.
Unfortunately, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the language of neighbors is a mandatory assignment in the Secondary Learning Institutes.
Chavez changes the time.
Nearly in Venezuela there will be another time-weight different than the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez lets the time in the South American country changing the half-hour hour.
Now Chavez is staying as a comic in Spain.
As reported by the Venezuelan Official Bulletin, if the new law is, the time will pass at least four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a timely right which does not exist in any other country of the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies its decision saying that the United States will impose the obligation to the world on their day by changing a complete hour.
In addition, Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the breaking of relations with his neighborland Colombia because of the action with rehenes.
The nationalist of the left said that he would not keep any relationship with the head of State or with the Colombian Government until the Conserver Alvaro Uribe continues to be the President of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do this," says Chavez, which is providing a constitutional reform where the citizens of the Oil country should decide on Sunday in a referencendum.
With this reform, its power could be fully expanded in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by repealing the mandate of Chavez in negotiations with the Marxist war in which the release of the rehenes was addressed.
On Sunday Chavez said criticizing that the decision Uribe has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is a lot of talk about Chavez.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you relax?", is the phrase that has already been a half million people.
This phrase called the King of Spain that felt worried for the continuous interruptions by the peoples of left in the last Ibero-American Cumber.
In 2007, the reduction of the real salary threatened Germans.
This year a decrease of the real salary threatens German employees despite a strong coy.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimist predict.
In accordance with the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should count in 2007 with a lower real salary account than the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak development of the salaries, the increase of the tax on the added value and the stream of the prices of food and energy," reported the magazine "Image" Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomic Institute and Economic cycles Research.
The new loads of unemployment insurance may also correspond to employees.
The Ministry of Finances Peter Setinbrück said to the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that gives the current situation, the purpose of reduce the employment security load by 3.3% at the past one year to another is just and reasonable.
Of course, the work office does not need to be again in a disappointable situation, requesting credits and subventions to the Federal State, the words of a politician of the German social-democratic party.
On Wednesday, the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the petroleum derivative sector was the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with the last year, these are increasing 3%.
Venus: Brother of the Earth.
Despite his atmosphere, Venus is the most similar planet to the earth, something that has not been planted until now. The European sondae "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolines in the poles, the same as appearing in winter in the Earth.
Three years ago, researchers had the doubt that they could exist rays in Venus.
But now the European survey has brought new tests: he discovered electromagnetic waves at the border of the atmosphere. In Venus, the rays are silent at a height of 54 miles from a cloud and behind the other, accounting Cris of the University of California in Los Angeles to the Scientific magazine "Nature".
The model of Urey-Miller's life origin is, the rays caused life on earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in its part, would have caused the aminoacidos that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not like this: if there was a day there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus can't have life: the atmosphere pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the surface resort temperatures of 500°C, so that temperatures can be reached under zero.
"Perhaps Venus is a "day" of the Earth, but is still a Âl," said.
The main goal of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, such as the Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
As since the ninety-years there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the "Venus-Express" review in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of investigations that will be submitted in many "Nature" articles are the opinion of researchers, not only remove Venus' unity in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbouring planets have more common features with the Earth than we had assumed," reports the ESA.
Despite the already known storm winds in the North Pool, researchers discovered in the south pool region also a garden formed by the clouds that turn faster.
This phenomenon reacts to the wind flows in the high-ground ground atmosphere of the pools, described a team of researchers of Giuseppe Piιοoni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12.000 km results almost so large.
This planet also called a white star or evening star around the sun almost 225 days.
But his rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equal to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmosphere pressure of 92 bars is not much like the earth, the centuries are part of the basis that both planets have been formed in the same conditions.
In the two planets, water remained in the oceans, but in Venus was disowned in the universe.
While the carbon dioxide had become carbon stones on the earth, in Venus the most of the atmosphere.
Kohler defended Merkel's middle with Dalai Lama.
Kohler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between parties for the receipt of Dalai Lama in the Federal Channel.
He criticized indirect the German social-democratic party for its attacks to the Federal Canciller after mythin in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, concerns the reputation of Germany and therefore concluded that the great coalition would end that fight for the receipt of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a United Nations divided," Kohler said to the period "Handelsblatt".
At the same time, Kohler showed its understanding about the receipt of Dalai Lama by Merkel Angela (Partido of the Democratic Union) in September.
"Although I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely viable to me," Kohler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must act with great balance in the external policy, subraying the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproche that he received in implementing a new policy with China.
"The Federal Canciller did not take the distance from the traditional course of a Chinese policy.
China also knows it," said Kohler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Partida), had directly shown its disappointment for the receipt of Dalai Lama and was attacked by the members of the Union.
In addition, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its non-operative policy in the external matter.
The receipt of Dalai Lama in the Federal Cancer caused great incomprehensions in Chinese and German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government refused not only the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Part), the Ministry of Finance of Germany, but also the information sources of the magazine "Spegel" were called the strategic dialogue of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinean Government Chef, was the Federal Angela Merkel Canciller who would recognize this receipt of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
With regard to China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of the Tibetan in their official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama showed that it is going to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Shaeuble warns that disturbances like the events in France will occur.
Battles with the police in the streets, shoots, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances like the case of France.
The Federal Minister requests that it be done all that is possible so that social insatisfaction in Germany is not moved to the streets.
In France, the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Shaeuble (Democracy Union Partid) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must fix TAMBIEN that social problems in our country do not take the violent form."
"This is what we have to take seriously," he said in the New Presse magazine, published in Hannover.
Not all young people are developed in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, said Shaeuble.
This does not only refer to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Count to the Islam Conference: all this is already giving its first fruits."
It's still time to sit for the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Shaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and social problems as in France.
Young people protagonize serious disturbances in the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
Tolouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, has made greater efforts for the Federal Government to integrate.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of a imitator effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the pair between foreign youths of less than 25 years is located above the average.
It must be concerned that there are more professional training posts.
Kolat subrays, "We have to give youths a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France " there is a large social control in the family," greater than the French country.
Moreover, most foreign youths do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat says, "But despite all, we need to be careful."
It is necessary to "build the opportunity for young people to receive a job or professional training more rapidly".
Meanwhile the night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with fairs overflowed the territory.
The responsible authorities informed three detentions, both of fired cars and cars.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1000 police is occupied with security.
After a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, Minister for Internal Affairs, announced that the police would take rigorous measures until necessary.
On Monday night about 80 police were hurt by disturbances in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the next night in Tolouse.
Disturbance eats for a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
Information provided by fiscality, the death of young people was not due to the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The very far action from the reality of the Federal Canciller, shows that the coalition on the content has reached its last point and that there is nothing more to expect of it.
But in what country does Canciller really live?
After her unexpected, inevitable and without much content in the general debate of the low Chamber, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As regards the prosecution that it has been made for repeatedly dedicated to external policies, Canciller will have it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that this would be a provinced way and thus showed that he doesn't want to understand what is interested in critics.
In the low room, it was very clearly declared to everyone that that reproach was suitable.
No minimum interest could be felt, nor any kind of feeling for the problems of the country.
Instead, Anglela Wolke presented this way: a very high policy that runs in the external policy and remains there without reaching anything concrete.
One example: Prevention of climate change: it is very thankful for the decisions taken in Saintndamm, but it does not say anything about how these targets should be carried out here on climate issues.
In general, this way to praise himself - since two years ago, the head of the Democratic Union Party has not been allowed to allow so much modesty.
You can start in expressions to get an impulse to people.
And in this way, it hurts its public image for the pragmatic concept that solves the problems without going through the rams.
But in the Kingdom of Angela Wolke, the internal problems are a little valuable appearance.
Poverty of children and concerns for workers with low salaries?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about this subject using subordinated prayers.
It's impressive how many times it's wrong to speak when it's about the addition for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three efforts to be able to form a more or less good phrase.
It begins to cross "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more concrete information.
The section of attacks.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, have made a debate in a closed debate on the YouTube Republical Presidency Presidency, and now they should be afraid of only a candidate from the outside.
The tensions between candidates have been noted since a beginning.
Mitt Romney replied to his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he would have converted to New York to "a resistance site for illegal immigrants".
This answered with serious reproofs: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani answered the former massachusetts Governor saying that he was who used illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates are taking the attacks: as even now the group of republicans has no clear favour, the eight presidential preliminaries use the debate in the CNN, especially to disapproval their opposers.
The 30-second small videos, rounded by Internet users who were sent to Youtube, do not have much content.
"In this way of isolation we left Hitler to get to power," that was John McCain's reproach to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one of the people who insisted on immediately rejecting Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many critics from the veterinarians of the war in Vietnam, when it refuses to recognize the "Waterboarding" torture, a questioning method, by allowing a person to join his death.
The public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important issues of the campaign are other, not only war in Iraq or torture debates.
The public always was very strong when they praised the conservative values and refused the extent of taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"In that time I was wrong," explains Romney compounded and asks forgiveness to people and to the public of television because of being a defense of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, rather, didn’t know what to say when they asked him what he thought about literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf rules without uniform.
On one day after his mission as the leader of the army, the President of Pakistan was sworn as a president.
This ends the eight years of military government in Pakistan.
Thursday, President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf took a jury for a second mandate of 5 years.
The Pakistanian television directly transmitted the ceremonie in the Presidency Palace in the Islamabad capital.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and to act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his military head mandate to his confident Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after it had been made with power with an incredible military fight, the ex-general government for the first time the state as civil leader.
With his refusal to the head of the Armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of imprisonment, which was announced by Musharraf on 3 November.
See Malik Muhammad Qayum, the general state tax, after Musharraf's swearing will quickly cancel the state of imprisonment and will comply with the second with West.
Since the state of advertising in the Supreme Court was published, there were many partial jurists of Musharraf. The week past the Supreme Court of the country was all resources before the new conflicted elections of the Government's head on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers died and four others were hurt.
A bomb exploded in one of the streets in the border with Afghanistan.
Return Krautrock's founders.
The most popular German band of the 70s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a retreat, a copy of "Live 1974" was written in the best time of the band.
At that time, they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to a official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has before himself his box, their caves, and above all its buttons.
In the middle it is sitting in Dieter Moebius, who is 63 years old and is clothed with a white truck.
On your left, Michael Rother is 57 years old, who has your computer and the guitarra.
At the dee, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, age years, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes to his sounds, among them there is even a ritme.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a part of music.
It doesn't seem to be the gentlemen.
Something very embarrassing for Krautrock's passionists was the fact that the Harmonia band was going to do music again.
What we need to rebuild here is the following: The questions with precision have shown that the name of the band was retumbling in the mind of people, but it wasn't something especial as so that the public after 32 years would be surprised as much.
But why don't Germans also applaud their live legend of the seventy years?
Especially because the Krautrock equivoco was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry granted a "Echo" music premium to the members of the Can 2003 band of Colonia for its lifework, the outstanding faces of the German pop artists were seen in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band The Düsseldorf and Neu!, they all opened the mouth with amazing.
Later Michael Rother passed the time on the scenario during the Concerts of Red Hot Chili Peppers as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in his country and recognition in the foreign, are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the third was only two years, and at those times, it has not been a great effect on the public, however, it has been successfully obtained by others.
Ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of fame.
At the beginning, they were playing at Berliner Shaubuehne's shot.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf who was patronized by a church.
Rother had a work in Kraftwerk and then worked a guitarist in the Never band! He was able to improve the fame of this German band that at those times was too radical.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster musicians in Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as kings of the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could be disturbed from his position.
That was better a life of artist full of surprises.
It is said that one day a band of association with the Harmonia of Ottenstein in the bathroom appeared, which resulted in a good name for the art.
There were also disagreements in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not only to meet himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was held during a concert in Grissem. Someone recalls that, in this case, almost 50 people were involved.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propulse Harmonia and to do once when you tried.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this requirement is against the habits.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on the subjects of exoterism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighteen years and since that time, he had more success than Harmonia.
The direct employment of the album in Griessmer, that must be thankful to Groenemeyer.
His music company Greenland was set as a goal to cultivate this own German contribution to preserve it as a living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the Nueve band was again from ferta.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band is located in the World Culture House in Berlin.
The band was subvented with public measures of the Wordtronic festival.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the Krautrock Sampler manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the Loveparade inventor.
In this way, all Krautrock's influences to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a place that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase associated with special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, she belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers in a finger.
The history of the development of the leyenda is shown in the projections of black and white photographs, where caves are seen.
In the bottom there are three veterinarians who began to improvize again.
They do nothing more than fixing microphones to the body and the battery so that they can produce extraordinary tons with the help of the effect equipment they have built with their own hands.
Now the electronic music is just as it had to be.
Three people who deeper in the technology.
But that doesn't change anything.
Below the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment, it is sorrowed, and in a good time of enfase it is sing "Aaaaaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a English source term.
But it was never about rock.
It was not searched for the origin of the gender in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or running from arts and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here crys "68!" has also the right, but now Harmonia keeps the calm.
The scenario is very well reflected on what is already clear.
Where starts and where does the music end?
This can break one's nerves or give a short time of happiness.
Richard Gere just missed more cinaism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Peace" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But both had no much conviction.
Or the concepts are very fixed in action and tirotees or the two films are too emotional.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case.
At the beginning, there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, continue to hide themselves in the Balkan mountain, but exactly there, in the dark inside of the country during the Bosnian war, was rehearted by actor Richard Gere.
Finally, we had lost the most beautiful man of the eighty years, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and little importance in the films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see the film "The Hunting Party - when a chaoser becomes what he follows" (Why today the film titles must be so long and shot?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the bottom, his reporter's role in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destination and the cinema industry would not have been so miserable with him. He was a man whose best time of life had already passed, that as a monument of the ruin of his deepness, the most of his pleasure had been kept up to now.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, together with "Moerderischer peace" that is the German production and will also be presented this week, it is just a number of films that are unsuccessful about war in the Balkans.
The movie "Moerderischer Peace" can be narrated in a few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a serb of Kosovo francothers, one of them acts very quickly, and that also leads to love her.
The sense of the movie is lost by actions and tirotes, although we celebrate that serbs are not more than the only guilty.
The movie is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without autopsie, but in war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated because there was never a good movie on war in the Balkans.
On another occasion, with another director and another writer (Richard Shepard in two charges), the story of reporters and §s in the war that are going to detect a war criminal serb called "storm", probably might be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are amazingly similar: small teams go to the mountain twice to carry out something that can't do the army and every time a foolish travel.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when they present us to Simon Hunt at the beginning, to whom they do not let him be just a cyclic with heart.
No, the script also provides a lovely aventure with a Muslim boss who will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from the reality, especially when the reporters with an impressive speed achieved what they couldn't achieve for five years the NATO, → and all the world's headachers, who was capturing the war criminal and leaveing them to the Muslim boss so that they could win in a just way.
It's so bad, that they're trying to call the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is actually a deeply human.
The film wants to condamne the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and it highlights that Americans and French are not really concerned about them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and bad are so similar, so one comes to his head a very very poema of Brecht.
In this poema it's a mask of a Asian demon: "In the big streets of his front I see, and feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In the films such as "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove that it is hard to be good.
The problem consists not only of the type of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently, in a period, he published that all Iraq films produced in Hollywood are fashioned.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star is in a crisis region or in mine fields, then there appears something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Along the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blowing diamonds" with DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may have occurred in a short time space.
They have to pass for at least decades until Hollywood rulls a good movie on the area with an example of the "The List of Schindler".
Some films already need more time. Classicals such as war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" at their time were not celebrated by unnimity as teachers' works.
Today, we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why every murder (Massenmord) is present in two televisions at home in our time.
And that's because Scriptural authors don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) to narrate good stories.
"Seer or not" or "The big dictator" resulted in such a good end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know that so bad was the Nazi regime.
Maybe it shouldn't be a good person to rotate a movie.
Maybe it must be like the newspaper Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of a artist.
When they asked him about the parallelisms between his historical "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he answered, "It is only deemed that some things never change."
The big cities are always in danger, men will always be murdered cruelly and in Yugoslavia will always rule war.
Von Beust receives the negative critical response on Olympics Games.
Hamburg's colleague received many critics from the political and economic for not requesting the Olympicals of the Year.
Many want to continue fighting for competition in the water sport section.
But Beust recalls that it must be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director-General of the Hamburg Trade Camera, showed on Wednesday this renuncia as "not good for the economic location".
In the last time, no other project in the large city has promoted such a motivation as the idea of the Olympical Games Organization.
"Unless this goal, the political impulse could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz's Senate did not advise this project, but found a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Alcalde Ole von Beust held his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in the Olympical Games Organization will not be performed until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for Olympics, but decides that the German Federation of Olympics," says von Beust in ONLINE.
He sent to the decision of the Sport Federation (Sportbund) expected at the beginning of December, on the request of Munich for the Olympics of the winter of 2028.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, that until 2028, we thought we would have no opportunity from the real point of view."
However, this dream didn't end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Deport Federation (HSB) lamentates the statements of von Beut.
This makes the impression that Hamburg doesn't want to ask the Olympics Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too quick to leave the opportunity to remove, if the plans are now destroyed," said Mr. Günter Ploß, director of HSB.
A rejecting of the application is contradictory to the declaration of the head of the Senate that has made in a receipt due to the general responsibility of the German Public Federation of the higher schools (ad).
There von Beust designed Hamburg's request for Universities of 2015 not as "a substitution" of the Olympics Games in Hamburg.
Only last week, the High-School Deport Federation appointed Hamburg as a candidate to the request.
The Fraction of the German Social-Democrate Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraction) reproached the senator that he would not use so valuable time for the building of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years, the senate was retraced with the development of the small campaign of Grasbrook, because this was on plans for Olympics Games or the building of houses," Carola Veit and Jan Quest, members of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always needed an integrated Olimpia planning for the small Grasbrook and then the use of builded houses, the CDU highlighted the importance of entertainment.
At that moment, Hamburg's request for Olympical Games in 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wood boxes.
Who relates to the terms of Switzerland and wood box, thinks about Ikea, but doesn't think about Andy Warhol.
Or?
Currently, the tree boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the list of works of Warhol.
Most of the nineteen and four Brillo-Box "type" of this list are "types".
After a few months ago, the Swedish magazine "Expressen" would have doubted about Brillo-Boxes' Brilloness in 1968 of Andy Warhol, the modern Museum of Stockholm performed internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the ex-director of the Pontus Hultén Museum gave to the modern Museum, and almost a hundred others of "type Stockholm", which are in the market of the international art, also resulted.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artificial and patrocinated productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, pinked red and white wood boxes with the same show that they had "Brillo" jabon powder cards.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works in 1968 in the Modern Museum, hundreds of brillo-cakes were exposed. These did not Warhol (for the expenditure cause), but were brought directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not artificial works, but examples (which were only some objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce a wood box in Sweden, but they were not exposed to the Modern Museet Museum.
The Witnesses of those times now speak about nearly fifty boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and subasta as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "type Stockholm" authorised by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after that the Pontus Hulten Museum's manager would make statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed nearly a hundred of the wood boxes that Warhol left to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exposure in San Petersburg.
At this time Warhol was dead since 3 years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the modern Museum Conservators, investigated six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and three of the Swedish private property that were made in 1968 in Stockholm. First, they were printed and sprayed their applauded plates and then pinted them into the oil with the pincel.
In contrast, the 1990 copies show that the painting was applied with a rodilla without printing exactly the applauded silvers. It is also not the oil painting but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorised by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," Lars Nittve, the director of the Modern Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Commission will not come to any conclusion, the Modern Museet Museum will classify these six boxes like copies/objects of exhibition."
In July, the Authentication Committee has formally announced that the "great accusations" is accepted in the case of jabon powder boxes.
But since that moment, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebellious soldiers are riding in Manila.
In the Philippines, the soldiers have been thrown into a hotel in Manila and have fallen by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The headquarters Antonio Trillanes, who reproached the President, the corruption and electoral fraud, said to a reporter that could not respond to blood-free.
True soldiers to the government had highlighted the hotel using lacrimogene gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers were attracted a few hours ago in the building.
Almost half of them, among them Trillanes, had the judgement for having done a state fight in 2003 that ended with a failure.
He used negotiations, so that he suddenly could be able to take up about 30 sympathisants.
Obviously, the military police who had to watch it had passed through their lines and followed their moth.
They entered the "Península" hotel and had the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government's troops locked the camp around the Noble Hotel.
The President called on an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, national security adviser, condemned the behavior of soldiers.
"The people are harden," said Trillanes.
"We invite people to pass our lines."
General Danilo Lim, who previously directed the elite group Scout Reangers, said that the other military troops wanted to follow the way.
The major government critics called on Thursday to a great manifestation against the President.
Since months, its government has received reproofs for corruption.
In 2003, the financial rate in Manila was a site that attached all attention to the motin that was opposed to Arroyo.
The rise failed after approximately 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines have at least seven tentatives of state-ups against the government chosen in democracy.
The United Internet will be the largest Versatel.
United Internet assured more than 20 percent of the telecommunication company's actions.
On Wednesday, the company informed that the average price for a action was EUR 14, 46.
There is only 20.05 per cent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about the absorption of the company.
There are also options to increase the financial part in Versatel.
The United Internet informed that this step wants to accelerate the DSL German market consolidation ( digital abonnement line).
On Wednesday, the proposals on enterprise in business have already been made, after Bredenberg increased its participation to Duesseldorf network operator by 5 per cent to 15,1 per cent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution maintains participation titles for a third partner.
The United Internet already on the previous day has participated with almost 10 percent in the telecommunication company Drillisch.
Drillish, in the measure of capital zooming, set 17,4 million of new actions with a value of EUR 106,4 million.
United Internet has bought from them 5,15 million actions for 31,4 million euros.
Furthermore, companies began with negotiations on DSL products marketing cooperation.
"We strengthen our cooperation," explained the United Internet portfolio.
The two companies found a joint MSP company to purchase the Freenet competitor.
Thursday, the United Internet reported that at the beginning, two companies want to be happy with the participation of 10 per cent in Freenet and do not use their rights, such as 18,49 per cent of Freenet.
This means that both companies held all options, especially the participation of anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic association ended at mid November.
This "play" with Freenet that will dure for many months and is not very comprehensible is part of the consolidation of the German market in Telecom.
At the end of the third quarter of Freenet, 2,9 million customers had a mobile phone contract and 1,27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Even now the United Internet and Drillish holding had just 6,01 percent of the Freenet participation.
Then they had agreed that Drillish would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18,49 per cent of the Vatas investment society was already agreed in August.
