In this world history phase, in America there is no such thing as an independent print. You know it and I know it.

Many of you are also likely paid for similar things, and any one of you who would be so stupid to drink what sincerely thoughts would be found out, in the street, looking for some other works. If I wanted my right thoughts to be likely payed for similar things, and everyone of you would be so bad to drink what I've been doing, I'd find it outside, in the street, looking for some other works.
