Inflation in Europe shot for food
Inflation inflated in the euro is increasingly caused by the inconsistent growth of food prices.
The price growth in 13 countries in the euro was higher than expected, after 2,6 per cent of the annual inflation was registered in October 3,1 per cent, the EU statistical authority notified.
The official preliminary suggested only 3 percent, reported by the Bloomberg Agency.
The European Central Bank (ECB) did not decrease the basic rate by the US, British and Canadian Bank by the reduction in combination with increased sugar prices and reduced unemployment resulted in inflation spirals.
The ECB would also maintain the inflation rates under two per cent, but close to them.
According to one of the analyses, the ECB is in absurdity: the inflation must be "draid" so that it does not have to do anything in this matter.
In Germany, the inflation of November represents 3.3 per cent of 15-year record; then in Spain 3,6 per 4,1 per cent.
The inflation in the euro was inflated up to the costs of food and energy.
The term prices of wheat stood by 88 per cent, and the soja course also reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for food and milk products.
The price of the rope on the world markets in this year was 52 per cent, and the last month, one black gold bargain was adequately 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, the inflation in 2008 from 2,1 per cent to 2,5, but in 2009 it is already decreased to 1,9.
According to the analysis, the level of 12 months inflation in the following 3-4 months continues to be approximately 3 per cent, and its average annual rates will be 2.5.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to decrease the rates in 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
Fidesz's movement centre has grown significantly, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while the Gallup's socialists have never reached so low - 13 percent of support.
In the case of the real electors of the party, the section, in view of the decision of opposition electors, would represent more than two-third (71 per cent) aid for the extent of five MSZP support.
The MDF and SZDSZ are under the pressure of access to the Parliament: their support for the whole population is two percent.
Among certain electors of the party are both hosts of the camps with one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has also been deteriorated in view of the previous minim - there was never yet any respect for those who consider the economic situation of the country as a very bad statement, so high - 41 per cent, while, according to the other 46 per cent, it is too bad.
Family values the change of their material ability by jail and age views are now more pessimistic.
As regards the next year, the largest part of the population with another deterioration and only tenths with improvement.
In the branch, 71 per cent of the questioned, which is most of all Gallup's relevant investigations that the premier performs his work more wrong than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsány or highly 13% of the questioned, while Viktor Orbán is 38% of the beneficiaries.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe 54 percent, to Fidesz's 27 percent.
One of the political development indicators is how large the public feels that uncomfortableness with the premium is possible to solve without the change of government.
While the government and the premises were considered to be requiring 35 per cent, this share is now only 20 per cent, while the relative quantity (33 per cent) looks at the solution only in writing new elections.
For reference interest, 60 per cent of the questionnaires were responsible to the question regarding their events that it would certainly come to the reference and that the additional 20 per cent would probably be reported.
For comparison, the "parlamental elections of this week" would certainly be involved only 55 per cent and 15 per cent of others would be considered likely.
The school would say not to 74, payments to the doctor 79 and payments for residence in the hospital 84 per cent.
If we look at the same parts only in the area of people who are sure promised their own, then the introduction of schools, payments to the doctor and payments for residence in the hospital refused 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most dear is Auchan, just fifth traveled Tesco
The hypermarkets in the building triangle held a low, a average of 16 per cent of price level growth, with the difference that the years have not increased the DPH.
Family journal Napi Gazdaság
The general dinner needy coast of Napi Gazdaság in the building three-year commercial triangle increased by 16 per cent in the average, but in all the hypermarkets, the increase in the price was noteworthy over thousands of forints.
Since the prices in the supermarkets have already been "flighted" in the springs, percentages have not resulted in such a drastic delivery, due to the earlier higher basis.
However, it is certainly uncomfortable for the consumers that what they could be purchased calmly under nine thousand forints will not be now even for ten thousand.
The needed coast of the Daily Economy in investigated hypermarkets exceeded the psychological border of ten thousand forints at least 91 forints.
The highest cost of the cost was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, 6 800 forints were required.)
The price of the Union and of the living fish remained at the lower level, but very deeply covered the wheat, olive, and also the mock.
The prices of bread and mouth corresponded to the data of the Central Statistics Authority, although in Auchana we found a kilogram bread in 139 forints.
The competition did not have the price of the product under 200 forints.
In this trade, it was also surprising that the price of Coca Coly was under 200 forints, so the stock was only 257 forints.
Even so, however, it was the most lover of Napi Gazdaság Auchan, and Cora was the most important.
According to our reports, she highlighted the prices in the needed box of Napi Gazdaság, as regards the prices of Vánoccio Cora about 15, while Tesco and Auchan about 18 per cent.
In comparison with the lower and aeroplane, the lowest value of the cover was 12 per cent, while the growth between the lower and aeroplane was 21 per cent.
In the forehead there was an increase in the average of 1 480.
The average increasing involving prices increased at 1 206 forints, in order to affect the prices of Vánoningen by the growth of DPH.
This process was just abroad, trade houses were obviously not able to determine how large prices of the hair should be determined in individual products, since they could not predict the impact of the change of prices on the need.
(If the operator plans and plans for the process of this product wrongly, it may result in an adjusted intensity of circulation, due to a significant profit of the price.)
For the purposes of the DPH, the increase in the price of the needed quota of Napi Gazdaság was so extremely shown that the price of the lovers of the cost was 1 720 forints higher than in 2006, while the price share of 844 forints in total.
For years, the national division has not been so delighted, the lovers of the coast was now with 1 630 forints more than the wheel and also the most important trip of 1 284 forints.
During the comparison of both holiday sessions, a disadvantaged growth of prices resulted in less than 20 months, the daily delays in hypermarkets exceeded 30 per cent.
(In contrast, it is not absolutely confirming the data of the Central Statistics Authority: it has increased in cases of certain basic foods increasing prices exceeding 30 per cent during 12 months.
Besides the mouth, for example, in case of oak.)
In the last case, however, it seems to be impossible, according to the needed quota of the Daily Economy, since the price level of the product, which is too delightful in the latest year, has been demonstrated in the light of the basis and in the worst case the price growth was more than 10 per cent.
The suppliers of myths are, according to all the stronger position than the suppliers of eggs, the drastic increase of prices has been made to them in international lines.
Hypermarkets in the commercial golden triangle are still referring to the good year.
According to our experiences, the costs are no longer interested in three visited businesses.
They purchase all quantities, permanent foods are payable.
In the middle of the afternoon, in all three supermarkets, long fronts were made at the middle of the board, because the rate of visits increased.
Of course, as we know, the turning outside is lower, the majority of international drivers makes research firms that markets remain for their plans, not only in the case of food but also in the sustainable use of goods.
In many places, the disinfectation is seen.
More than thousands of cases of infection in the year were registered in diseases in particular due to an accidental use of antibiotics.
Hygiene sickness submines, liver-filling, anxiety of the staff's stop person doesn't help, states the Primary of the National Epideological Centre.
In many places, they are also seen in desinfectional disorders.
Recently, in the traumatological division of the Holy Jan’s disease, MRSA infection has been infected.
Bacteria with antibiotics were discovered in men who got to the hospital after serious transport accident.
It was isolated.
Similar infections appeared at the same place at the beginning of the year.
Injured by a severe autonomy, it was left home, but a little after it had to return with MRSA infection and because of a bacteria that was insufficient in his body has not yet been performed one important operation.
At the 10th aeroplane, Nesocomialis Surveillance was reported to 1 094 sickness infections caused by multi-resistent disease powder, reported Karolina Böröč, the prime of the National epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multiresistent diseases have been registered in diseases with certainty, they do not know the ends.
Approximately two thirds (683) infections were caused by MRSA or methicilin-oxaciline with gold resistant cycle.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is wearing a third person in the nose without providing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cross-treatment, muscle, skin infections, rare infections) are well responsible for antibiotics and are well treated.
However, antibiotics are given in excessive or inadequately, developing from a bacteria that is well reacting to antibiotics that are very odd against antibiotics and which is spread in non-compliant disease points.
Moreover, in the case of transitional or duration of the immune system in patients with weak body, low body weight or in patients in years may cause serious disease infections, such as rare infection or blood infection - sepsis.
According to the opposite doctor of Saint Jana, there is no special infection on MRSA infection, similar infection belongs to daily practice diseases.
"Infection should not be replaced by epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the illness is not examined."
Disolishing antibiotics
"These patients are isolating, the treatment staff is treated in rubber hands and mass and we need antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients receiving in the hospital are previously investigated whether MRSA is present, and that does not allow infection to be avoided.
Sample Selection Not in Mode
The majority of disease infections caused by MRSA would be possible to prevail, but the current conditions and submines in the homes of diseases are not to prevent the exhibition and spread of multi-resistential disease-related poetry, Karolina Boröczová.
Since this infection appears significantly in illnesses and homes for elderly, patients receiving patients should control and immediate isolation of MRSA.
The collection of microbiological samples, however, in Hungarian diseases, is not in mode.
It also plays a role that the National Health Insurance Fund does not financ this investigation.
The most of the cases are discovered as if a patient suffers an emergency infection of MRSA, the primary epidemiological centre said.
The European Union has a serious recommendation for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in human medicine and also exists domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted or should be conducted a microbiological investigation in order to minimize the resistance to medicines, but they do not have this disease in any case.
Microbiological sample selections are even more rare in the basic, respective ambulant treatment of patients, reported Karolina Böröcz.
See on disinfective illnesses
According to decade evidence, MRSA is most frequently spread among patients with health personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in moving hands and use of hands and masks, but even in the diseases there are serious failures.
MRSA is transferred by cappenin infections and touches, but in cases of home diseases it is not possible to isol the infected patients.
Rather, rooms are often overflowed, the dog is often very close to himself, perhaps from epidemiological views patients should be remote at least 1,5 meters.
As Karolina Böröcz observed, despite that we can also meet in illnesses that are located in an incidence in materialal ability, in the disorder rate, the treatments are less and patients whose chance of infection is still increased.
According to Karolina Böröčů, there are necessary protection measures, similar infections indicatively less or further breeding of the disease can be stopped.
Governing Programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents significant health security expenditure, so it fights everywhere.
For example, in England, the Government wrote MRSA prevention programme, respectively reduced its performance.
It seems that the program is successful, according to published data show MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Sickness (ECDC) provides for preventing the result of multi-resistent disease psy (including MRSA), respective disease infections caused by these diseases, among their priorities.
The policeman who caused death accident was not drunk
The official finding trial in case of police officer XXII, which caused death accident, is ready.
It can be said that the police officer of the XXII campaign, who killed the driving, and who went away from his own, would lead under the influence of alcohol or deteriorated substances, informed the speaker of the Supreme State Representative of Attila Morvai on Friday after the conclusion of the finding trial of this case.
The finding trial confirmed the result of the original investigation, which already stated that the former police officer had been seated before he was seated as a volant, had not lived any alcohol.
The Police Director of the XXII campaign struck in the street of Lajose Kossutha in XXII, with his own own car, in the department of a fifty-year-old man, who went before in the transport of a car outside the specific transition.
(Last named that the walker has passed outside the zebra, finally, in accordance with the rules of the road operation, is not a wide range of circumstances, the removing car must also give a priority.)
After transporting to the hospital, a walker died.
For the purposes of these attacks, the driving police manager demanded the transfer to the debt, according to the police notice, because it was so distorted by the case.
In this case, the Budapest Research Representative of State Research is conducted.
Atila Morvai also changed that the former police officer cooperated with the State representatives of investigation since the beginning.
Other 400 million euros for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit institutions at the total value of 400 million euros for the support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy signed on Friday in Budapest, the Minister for Financing of Janos Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the Hungary budgetary financing of projects in the transport and life-based transport supported by the Cohesion Fund, a value of 300 million euros, while the parties have already closed a credit amount of 100 million, now signed with the use of 200 million euro remaining.
In addition, for the budgetary financing of projects associated with education, the credit agreement is EUR 150 million.
The EIB approved for Hungary in total 300 million euros, for the rest of 150 million euros, with the extent of the credit with a share.
In the innovation, the parties signed 50 million euros, which would mainly use the budget for the research and development project of the Debrecian University.
It was also a 4-way road.
The parties agreed that after the agreement of Hungary with the EU's financing detail, they would return to whether and how it should be modified.
This can be done according to Janose Verese in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed in Hungary since 1990 a total of EUR 8,4 billion of EUR 113 projects.
The credit tax provided by the EIB with eighty-year waiting period and without the obligation to provide is linked to EURIBOR rates.
Bulgaria is a reality of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian Facilities Market is increasing - the attention of the whole Europe turns to a little memorable Balkan country.
What, where and who are still purchasing the most important, but with the EU markets?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
The most seeking Eastern European goal of purchase is now that Bulgaria is in doubt with its left-league apartments and houses in the sea.
From the mountain they are most in the course of Bansko, Borovc, Pamprovo and Vitosh, in the sea areas, then Albena, Golden Sing, Solned villages, the ancient city of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more people are also looking for incapacity in the area of Kavarna and Baltic.
According to the analyses of Re/Max Bulgaria, the investors and the central part of the country will raise an interest - such as Graniko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and still buy more interesters in the area of the left city of Russia.
The main city of Sofie is also the promise of medical options, business and office rooms promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is the best way to change into one of the most accessible golf areas of Europe, and thus becomes an age and worm-seed for the aim of the road and in the two other annual areas.
Previsible investors already buy in large, for example in the area of Banska.
According to the analysis, buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and life.
The most clients come from England, but boughters from France, Austria, Spain and still more often from Romania.
There are also Malta and Cyprus investors in the Black Sea and in the Ligaries, then traditionally many Russian clients.
The purchasers are low to share in three groups, says Georgij Jankov, the regional director of the company Re/Max Bulgaria.
Increasing people buy or renewable opportunities for 50-100 thousand euros, or an old house in 5-15 thousand euros, which then renew.
They require good availability and communication options, which are important for them in the nearby of the large city, trade and the correction of local doctor.
Second category are chat buyers (Bulgary has been organized in the first 10 German recreation targets in Bulgaria).
The third group constitutes commercial investors who purchase a value access to the average or Horizon.
Treatment of the potential in the main town is unpersuasive, because the request is more powerful.
In Bulgaria, however, the lowest prices of reality in the European Union, but in the past five years have increased by 21 percent annually.
Increasing inability prices are significantly higher than the growth of the payments.
Fodor and Hungarian six per cent
According to the information of the Ministry of Life and the Water Company of Gabora Fo, the meeting of experts will be completed in a deterioration and, after the central official start, the international climate regime will continue to negotiate ministers after 2012.
Experts and policies from 192 countries are concerned about the path of Bali map, which resolves the efforts following after the period of reduction of the Kyoto Protocol set out in force until 2012.
At this point, a debat between developing and developing countries has been discussed.
The United States also announced that they are not currently going to act on precise numbers, although they are attached to the agreement to reduce glass gas by 25-40 per cent in the 1990 state.
Another important question is whether developing countries will be accessed, besides the reduction of material and material assistance to countries that are shown to them.
The Agreement also refers to aids for developing countries.
The Investment Fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be conducted by 16 members of the Government Council, most likely under the World Programme for the Protection of Life (GEF) at the United Nations - we can read in the Piac is Profit magazine.
Hungarian six per cent
The Ministry of Life and Water Company, Gábor Fodor, named Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in the efforts to global climate protection and to assist the development of new international agreements until 2009.
The Minister concluded that the EU is committed to decrease in 2020 by 20 per cent of raw levels of 1990, independent of the success of the adoption of "the agreements after 2012", and it is prepared to commit up to 30 per cent reduction in the case of the final development of the world, respectively developing countries, to accept the responsibility and obligations that are in accordance with their option.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that the countries attached to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 were decreased for a decrease of 5.2 per cent, whereas 15 EU Member States were then committed to 8 per cent.
The Hungarian commitment is a reduction in the reduction of 6 per cent of railways for the years 1985-87, which is to comply with our own. - The printing report of the Ministry of Life Age is held.
The Bali is very important because it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on the climate change policy within two years, otherwise its entry into force with certainty until 2012. In that case, the commitments to reduction by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately deal with a new reduction system, which also shows the need for the United Nations International Develope Collection, which remains with climate changes - IPCC, which is the Nobel's price priceholder.
This would lead to the late reduction of the weight and inevitable increase of the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees of Celsia, which should, according to the factors, be extremely serious and inevitable.
British Army drives a set on YouTube
British military units publish on a server to share videos from action in Iraq and Afghanistan, which themselves popularize.
YouTube first enjoyed British aircraft forces (RAF): special units operating in Afghanistan since March 2006, reported BBC.
The records made by a miniature camera attached to an adjunction are controlled by the management of air forces in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
Political message is unexpected
This form has already been found in the Internet for 139 British aircraft soldiers, and their "canal" has already been looked at more than 75 thousand people.
The British Defense Ministership was registered in June 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and published the records of action in Iraq and Afghanistan while the British Ministry for the Commonwealth Office and the international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) has its own channels on YouTube.
Saturation in Afghanistan
The air forces have published the videos in accordance with their planning for the assembly and the Ministry of Defense are good to notify the broad public with the objective of the presence of the army in the ship.
"The prosecution published by this form of translating traditional television advertisements is not worth anything," reported the BBC officer on the matter of the defence of Gordon Mackenzie, "but it also needs a political message, because the special form confirms the rights of military action that the government has decided."
Americans made a game
The Armageddon causes concern that, according to the carefully modified, censured records, also reached on the server, amateur videos, such as the death of soldiers: in a few covered, "official" propagation films, the most highly speaking about losses, but there is no bloody shape of battle.
The Internet has finally reached a lot of videos from the fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, which has come up at an easily settlement, but the British army has come on them until now.
Americans run a bit differently - using shooting games called America's Army, which is free to station and in which the player can get more than a simulation directly to the soldiers' corner.
To the Ministers, the birthdays will be with a tomb and a pagacy
The Ministry of Lamperth's work is obviously not emotional: Instead of dinner dinner, he works for its collaboration with the final work of the meeting, which has been broadcast and coffee by 2007.
In some ministers, there will be a celebration with a living music, otherwise he will test the officers of the night atmosphere with the tomb and the tissue.
Wednesday, vacuum atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so it's strong.
The State authorities are also prepared for birthdays.
The most accurate ministerial celebration for years is organizing the Defence Ministry, but it does not expect its employees.
The poverty will receive gifts for children of falling soldiers, at the missionary wallets of family soldiers, who are currently served on missions, but also organise receptions for journalists.
Resorts to the atmosphere end of 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will be delivered to the final resources.
The dinner of the GKM is held in the center of Jöv · Haza, at all 4 320 000 forints, and of six hundred ministerial employees are expected of approximately three hundred fifty hosts.
Resort will be held in his celebration on the night traditions, but it will also come to different exhibitions and will also lose the tombol.
The NFU's births remained 4 700 000 forints and were made in the middle of the United States Justice Council (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the programme.
The rest was charged for more than four hundred invited.
One NFU seems to be invited to another holiday celebration: there is a company in order to ensure the progress of tenders, the Hungarian Economy Development Centre (MAG) of Union money.
After that, they found the Wiggsinaz district building.
MAG and S.A. have not confirmed this information because we were not able to attach the person concerned.
Doesn't need clothes
The OIT building was not only NFU but also the Ministry of Justice and Safety, which was organized in the place of Vánoc 7.
However, the OIT did not want money for the use of its sales.
It was five hundred people.
The evening started the Minister of Health, and after dinner, it was possible to dance for the delivery of life music.
According to the answer to the portal question [origo] on the dance, no evening clothes or clothes were obliged.
Puritan festivals seek health, work and local self-resources.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and honor for employees for 400 000 forints in their own building.
The Ministerial work of Monica Lamperth's cooperation does not even officially call to the dinner dinner, but to the final work of the meeting.
It is calculated for hundred eighty hosts that, according to the printing division, only get coffee and pagacy, so there will be only 350 000 forints on the party.
Gordon Bajnai's local self-administration Ministry will easily contribute to its cooperation in the Ministry of Local Rights and Regional Development Hall.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a quarter conference that expects 436 workers in their own large salon.
At the holiday party, it includes 2 500 forints at the host - the total amount includes receptions with Swedish tables and appeals.
Since the time that is Minister Janos Veres, she celebrates the work of PM Birthday every year.
However, the dinner atmosphere will be missing, the officiality will strengthen not only the ministerial demonstration but also the afternoon.
Agricultural Resort is held on 20 January, the Ministerial Birthdays are not finished.
The receipt of the vacation in Vajdahunyadvar in the Civil Seeds and according to the Ministry's notice, 1 000 forints per person are appointed for hundred guests.
According to the printing section, it will be considered a very simple receipt to be invited only to the relevant credit diplomates in Hungary.
These annual receipts begin a short health minister and finish a serious invitation.
The Ministerial Ministry of School and Culture of Won's Wednesdays are not organized, shared the [origo] port of the relevant printing division.
The price of the night celebration of life resort in the printing division was not able to communicate.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to dinner at the Artistrom Museum.
It's getting to the woods of the staff
The Association of Communities of Liga, respectively the entire State Assembly of the Working Council (MOSZ) will create its staff Commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday unlimited stages.
On Saturday, protesting public construction, on Monday - on the final vote on health insurance law - will be stopped.
The actions will certainly cause a serious interruption of transport because it will completely stop railway transport and will also establish Budapest's carrier (BKV) employees until 13 hours.
On Wednesday, the Liga Association shall notify the Joint Working Board with the details of the organized Monday staff together.
It will also take place the LIGA-MOZ Staff committee, which will coordinate the Monday action.
On Saturday, protesting public construction is made, and from Monday, the committee associated with the staff will stop working for a time unexpected if it does not come to agreement with the Government.
This means that there is no termination for the end of the stage that will begin on the day of the vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The Parliament would not finally accept the Health Insurance Law, but the Committees will immediately download the challenge to the staff.
However, the legislation shall be revoked, the Staff Commission shall be meeting and shall decide on another procedure.
According to the Monday meeting of the Parliament, it is also possible that the law on health insurance will be voted at the latest evening, eventually night hours.
For the purposes of the starting station on Monday, it is possible to calculate serious interruptions of transport: on the railway work will be stopped for an unexpected period, the next afternoon can be stopped by the part of the Budapest's hot transport and more than half of Volán's company.
It will also take place in many countries at the same time to close the half of the railways.
For the challenge of the staff, the public committees and civil organizations whose list is continually updated on the pages of the Liga Association.
Some organizations have advertised the stage for a time indefinite, and others have reported temporary stops of work.
To the quarter afternoon, the Hungarian State Roads (MÁV) and the independent staff officers (VDSZZ) were not able to agree either at sufficient services, while at the beginning of the holiday holidays, more people travel on the railway.
According to the advanced communications, BKV will be established from the beginning of the operation to 13 hours, from 7 to 9 hours from Budapest Airport, a four-year stage shall be organized by the Committee on Working Affairs in the Energy LIGA, to 2-, respectively 2-8 hours of work, and to the Democracy Committee Association of Pedagogs.
The association of Hungarian physicians will be established in the entire country, the Democratic Committee on Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), belonging to the Cooperation Forum of Communities (SZEF), has a two-year extent of stage.
The most important of the four requests formulated by the Liga Association is that the Government rejects the reform of the health insurance and presents a new concept to the public debate.
The second request is that a new way of calculation of revenue is valid since the next year.
Third to ensure the possibility of entry into the system before 2010 at the provisional department for the relevant work.
The fourth point of action is that the Independent Agency of Trade Workers (VDSZZ), falling under the Liga Association Committee, does not accept the offer for the Ministry of Economy and Transport relating to railways, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian garden increased the risk of country
The activity of the Hungarian Garden based on the support of Jobbik Magyarorzhágért in August of the year, according to the risk analysis (Risk Analysing Division) of the Political Capital Institute, has immediately increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole level.
The "notice of risk" is written by the company developed: In relation to the activities of the Hungarian Garden, the greatest political risk is that "shopping already an existing ethnic impact between the Roman and the Neromean Hungary can already reach a short time to violent ethnic centres".
I say that the political strategy of the Hungarian garden probably aims to implement such actions - adds a research institution.
As it is written, it is possible to explain one of the largest unity of the Hungarian political representatives: "The public debate on the Roman Question left the representatives of the public life to the representatives of radical and extremely political collections that could set a political strategy on Roman and Hungarian resolution."
This is a challenge, disables normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the probability of violent conflicts - judges the institution.
Furthermore, the activity of the Hungarian Garden, according to the research institution, has been influenced by the great attention of households and foreign media "to a significant measure, showed Hungary's image in the spring, especially regarding the faith in the stability of the country and its democratic growth".
The Institute at the Assembly: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-direct groups, which have been obtained from 2006, is that in Hungary, a number of organizations called "National Households" has been created from 2007.
"The common drawing of these groups is that they define themselves as a civil association, while they are openly reporting - and armed - the preparation of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the case of animal disasters, the attack of authority, the destruction of the order), and also with the indication of the incapacity of police, army, or State," he adds.
It also notes: all of this is in a way that is trying to packaging the most different political efforts set up on the opposite of society to political and civil clothes.
In the case of these collections, the balance of civility and the form of a community is therefore not only used to avoid the legal accommodation of the legal registration, but also the political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian garden is also a major risk in view of neighborhood relations.
"In the past months, there are some of the neighbors in Hungarian Garden as a potential source of danger, the ultranationalist political representatives of some neighborhood countries want to excuse their own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this can have an impact on the political stability," adds.
According to the research institution, there is no survey of the Hungarian Garden in the Central and East Europe of a single evidence, so the political risk has increased as a whole.
As it is written, the activity of the Hungarian Garden is like, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Garden, which the creation announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
At the back of the bulgarian garden, the massive romanian disasters have been spent in one of the Sophia quarters (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used to hold the garden with the goal of the organization is "national household".
In the past 17 years, it stated that in Bulgaria, the "cicana terror", but the state remained inactive and inactive at the Political Capital Institute.
It adds that the initiative has launched a busy debate on the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic streets signifies the notice of some Bulgarian Roman organizations that it will create its own garden on a sign of opposition.
Since the sustainable activity of the Hungarian Garden shows similarity to the activity of the Bulgarian National Garden, it is not clear that even the Hungarian Romans react to a threat similarly, by establishing their own household, we can be warned of the risk developed by the Political Capital Institute.
Atila Juhaš, the research manager of the Political Capital Institute: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institution.
As he said, the risk analysis issues each year and if it finds something that may affect the change of risk, they inform public reductions, such as advertising the risk.
The holidays are not all free
In Hungary, the days of freedom are precisely established by the law, and it has already been a general practice that the holidays are overcome by the work of the days, which waits less times in the next year.
In the European Union and in America, there are no units.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and national festivals and working days.
Working days with respect to the church of holidays or a significant historical attack.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is free - to the New Year, so that people can rest after Silvester.
In the year, we have a total of 11 free holidays.
The National Festival is the 15th March celebrating revolution from 1848 and 23 October, the Memorial Day of Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the labour of the State, 1 May, 1 November, 2 November.
Besides, we have two-day Holiday Holidays, Aviation and Birthdays.
Since our national, national or religious festivals, according to the calendar, rarely look for weekends, the practice of the movement of the working day has occurred in cases that they worked only one day before the free holiday or after it.
The price for long-term weeks is, however, that we stay at work and at school.
The day that the festival is without prejudice or follows it, we are working for a long period of years in the special Minister for Work.
The rule shall apply the same measure to all employees and their employees, public employees and public employees.
However, it does not apply to the fire and institutions which are in the operation without interruption or, in view of their designations, are working in the days of work peace.
Years will be changed only around the holidays at the end of the year: since the 24th life in the country, it will be stopped, because, according to the successful experiences, the number of people in the days between birth and Silvestr "works" before or uses such a free release.
In the next year, a few of our holidays will fall to the end of the week, so the movements of the working day will be less than the years.
First, the calendar changes around the holiday of work so that workers can stay at home for four days of age.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so that it may be on Friday 2 May.
The next movement relates to the 23th October: on Saturday 18 October, it will work in place of Friday 24th.
The end of the next year, however, will be able to walk completely in the sign of the holidays, because they will have almost everywhere the non-stop of the south, even though Silvestr falls in the middle.
Six disturbing little ones you can hurt your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, the voice messages that we never receive, the innocent lies that we do not know or not: it's all "speaking" every day on the work.
The question is, if you are going to develop these detailed inaccessibleness, or if you are putting hands and unexplained ones that can end up, you will be able to avoid intentionally.
Guys.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they've been looking for you from the marketing department," the colleague will tell you.
That's why you missed the tenin?
In the best case, it is suffering and trying to make it, if it calls to the marketing department and says that the message has forgotten to translate (that is less common solution).
The most often thing is resolved once with excuses.
Before it comes to a deceitful discussion, it's good to think about what you could prepare to the colleagues an inappropriate choice, and try to prevent it.
Do you like something that's not yours?
There's nothing more inappropriate than when you're reaching for writing, office need or for your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember you put on the board yesterday, but it's gone?
Or have you discovered your pearls on the table of some of the colleagues that you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues, Otherwise they'll be wronged with you because you're in the case of them.
Don't take away from the pack office or nice paper because it may be unfair when they come to you before, and you will need them immediately.
Coach's private life?
There's no good solution to stop the spreadsheet.
Who with whom did he do?
Where and why?
Don't know everyone on the nose of his message (domains) about the private life of colleagues!
When some of them share their secrets with you, do not use his trust.
Close what you have heard, and do not try with your friends, nor when it is the end of his things.
Are you proclaiming your absence?
If you call to the office and with a strong head pain, you report your absency because you're not good, or you're saying that you'd like to rest today, you think that your jobs, inadequate jobs and works that have a certain term, you'll have to do someone else for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know the second day you're not going to work, or that something can happen for what you're gonna have to stay home, make it known that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your abstention to the second day.
Use, hire, phone
Did you get in the work from which you've been throwing a colleague?
Do you want to be a witness to the phone talk that wouldn't be better to hear?
Don't break your cooperation by using, changing, voting, speaking (over the head), neither by du, inconsistent clothing, by voice of uncomfortableness.
All of this can be distorted even when they are not directly prohibited to the same project (writing, planning, organisation).
Are you guilty of other mistakes?
If there is nothing time or you forget to send a important letter or a message, do not blame for your forgetting the other!
Don't call on a casual chaos dominant in the office and the coachs!
Recall, if you were wrong and somebody paid it, and you're aware of it!
Ask yourself how you could get the thing in a good way, you're insult!
Do you feel too like home in the office?
Towels and papers: Famous clothes at home, but they don't go to the office!
Don't take your clothes for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be bad, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in the running chat - and if your profession requires, beautiful and elegant!
When a man wants to win, he stops to be interesting
Conjunction in the usual disorder of the cockpit.
From education, special melodie is called: the sound of the woods to which electronic effects are connected.
I add volume.
Music changes time and adds the base to the previous tone coloring, and then the woman’s congregation is joined as a clothing.
At the mr2 station, the Zagar group track is called Wings of Love.
Home musical life has not just dismissed us with a quality electronic pop.
At once, but the cup looks pretty different because you just listen to the new Zagar album.
Revelation of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions from the home digital underground changes the total image quickly, although it is again in the garage mode with its milk in cytary, even the home electropop shows that there is something new under the sun.
Baláz Zságer started in Pentecost, and he also played in Yonderboy's Cape, at the end - maybe because two students didn't go into one board - did his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that connects elements of jazz, electronic dance and pop, he began to proclaim until he was invited to compose audio tracks (e.g.
The film of Ference Töröka "Szezon").
His forming, playing at the beginning in small clubs, knew a larger public after what the magazine wan2 organized their first albums from 2002 between the fifty most important home decks and announced Zagar in Yonderboie for the only household entities that could be sold to the West.
Zagar and his captain are without doubt "in the course", even though no one asked them if they were disappointed with this box.
The capelle reacted as it belongs: she made a new, better album.
Now issued album with the name Cant Walk Fly Instead can open them new paths, although the same name is trying to create an invasion with the beginning years in Pentecost.
It's one verse of the track that's the oldest pills of Balaz Zsager.
The link to the etheric, the flight would have been at the place, but at the ethern east of this music it now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time - the voice of the cycle, the influence of rock and role.
In these songs, the song György Ligeti was represented at the premium of the table in the Millenáris park, who was currently working in England with the group The Puzzle.
Album also produced a real hit, thanks to the Mr2 Pet·fi station, playing the last time from the evening to the annual music, we began to build a variety of Wings of Love tracks, replaced with six householders ("Underground Divas").
So everything's okay (?).
Portal Hvg.hu said Balázz Zsager.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, is a question of how much remains what you're playing?
Baláz Zságer: Definition of border music for me doesn't mean much.
I think there are two different boxes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Even such alternative, underground music can be a flat, nothing say, and it can only occur because of the sale, which makes it commercial.
Of course, a good pop track can produce from sincere internal needs.
This spirit also works as accepted, independent of the language and the state.
hvg.hu: Do you see a division in the opening of the Hungarian and Zambia public against your music?
B. Zs.: In the forest, especially from us to west, a easy music has more tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people after twenty, but also elders.
Many more view the changes of easily music running around them, as they also view it as part of the same culture.
Hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
You're interested in who, where, where and in what great number does your music listen?
B. Zs.: Of course, it's a good feeling that more people go on our concerts.
But we never did music for the market.
We don't have music with a goal, but with something.
The public's role is also given to concerts where the one already works, but it is hidden only in inappropriate changes.
However, I noticed that when a man wants to make public, he stops to be interesting since that moment.
Hvg.hu: How much do you want to follow Yonderboie's example?
He works alone and his career built more than us to west.
B. Z.: We're not actually going on his way, not depending on our music sometimes trying to explain.
We are also team players who listen to the musical presence of the other and let it be developed.
At the beginning, of course, we should avoid that our work doesn't compare to Yonderboie tracks, which some of us separated from his hair and issued with another way.
hvg.hu: In the warm station, the Wings of Love came to the first place.
Many heard the name Zagar first in relation to this track.
Did you open the most popular levels in the house?
B.Z.: We shouldn't have planned to write a hit to which they sold the table.
That song's about more.
We thought it as a final album that we tried to release this previous audio orgia and more consistent theme.
How did you choose these six songs?
Why is it just-- what was the main principle?
B.Z.: The representative was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then the idea came to compose this congregation from a solstice of a home music scene with a good voice.
So this sixth - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judea Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enik ́ Hodosi [Neo], Juice Neemeth - which we then have been baptized at Underground Divas.
That's exactly how you've been thinking of a song, or have girls changed something on her?
B.Zs.: The fund already existed in an instrumental version when the material was met on the table, we said that there would be something else necessary for this track.
The Sled of the Akords was able to join him a song.
On the other day of the night, I sang a melodia that the girls learned later.
It was almost first and terriblely spontaneously.
I wonder how it survived, but of course it needed Divy.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so energy.
Hvg.hu: As on the table, the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have only (excluding Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they don't lie together, and they're not more void than music, so music just does not accept their songs.
They also stood back on the beach.
Is that meaningful?
B.Z.s.: It was only for technical problems.
That we didn't want to divide a single role, it's meaningful.
And this track is about it, and they forgot a little of their egos, from where they belong, and they only left them with those cords, the cleaves of love are to be recognised.
I wanted this euphoric condition that we felt when the song was born, they felt the last.
What was the most work?
B.Zs.: When music is composed, either with one, more hard cooks have occurred in the mixture.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I'm playing on the concert crystal, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work groves, then everything nicely found his place as a laptop.
Hvg.hu: What track is your favorite?
B.Zs.: It's still changing the concertation, and I've already left the table.
Now it's the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Foreigner risked billions of minorities
Prorad defrau.
So he marks his fearful employee Jeroma Kerviel the French Bank's gigant Societé General, the owner of the Netherlands Commercial Bank.
It came to him too unfortunately about five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to balance the colleagues and also unable to.
In the case of all large banking houses, he has always recognised the crisis on the American market of hypoteque.
"It's mentally weaker," he's in the mouth of his surrounded ones who sent to the police.
However, as it comes from Kervie's response, which the French media, such as Le Monde journal, was a person who had from his business of profits at the end of the latest year at 1,6 billion euros.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in response.
In the year, he was able to make a half billion euros for the American crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to be revealed that the so-called sub-prime hypoteques, given to low-group clients or those who had problems with payment in the past, will have problems.
The effect of this crisis on the whole economy, but she had no effect.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it up right.
At the end of the year, his winning was spent to 1,6 billion euros.
"Because I did the first half-million, I didn't know how to tell it," Kerviel admits and adds that he didn't leave anything for himself.
In all hearings, he admits that he has fake records so that it doesn't come to it.
He's even been able to shame the boss, even when she started his business to care about the Eurex burst.
The risk was obtained
He was afraid he'd come on?
No, no, no.
"I thought just the simple fact that I made 1,6 billion for the bank will be satisfied."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to work at his position gradually.
In the Society of General, he was invoked in 2000 exactly after he studied the University in Lyon.
His annual payment moved about $51,000.
Two years ago, he was a assistant and became a single person in 2005 with an annual payment of 90 thousand dollars.
Yet, he agreed that he never could do so much as the rest.
"In my first conversation in 2005, I felt that they were watching me.
For my education and for professional and personal development," Kerviel described researchers.
But soon after the outcome, the first great success arrived.
Thanks to allianz’s actions, he was seated at the bombing attacks to London, so he had a half billion euros.
And that was the starting mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're doing, we'll let you go.
"It's like a snow wheel," he said to the police.
But the boss had to do everything, or they'd do more.
"When I made money, they put their eyes on."
But then it came to the beginning of this year.
On one day, he spent a billion euros.
After weekend half January, he wanted to hit it.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work anymore.
And the bank reported about a few days later that it was about five billion euros.
And how did they come?
He's been understood because of his allowed.
"I chose only four days in the past year.
The master who has no allowance is a man who doesn't want to watch him in his records," Kerviel closed.
Czechland has the chance to get 365 billion
The Ministers of the Czech Government and the representatives of the European Commission last night signed a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can gain 14 billion euros in the next years (approximately 365 billion crowns).
It is a half of the total amount that the Czech Republic may receive from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will come from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns from the Business and innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will move to the transport.
The transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the UKs that can be received from the funds.
These money will increase the budget of the State Fund for transport infrastructure, which will explore in the next year with 90.8 billion crowns.
Business and innovation programme must serve businessmen and companies to gain innovative enterprises.
Companys should receive funds for the implementation of new rubbers, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
In the EU funds' efficiency, money belongs to the CR in the newly adopted countries between the least successful.
Twenty-year trial for the President of Nikaragui confirmed the court
The Court of Justice in Nikaragu confirmed the twenty-year penalty for the former President of Ar ́d Germany, which was judged in 2003 for financial underwaters of 100 million dollars (without 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was released and lived in the home processing on his fairness almost a non-caragain metropole.
If some of the heads of this Central American State are returned from 1997 to 2002, it is not according to the AP agency at this moment.
According to the Presidency of the Court of Appeal of Ileany Perez, the parties will now be concerned about the English factors whether Germany is allowed to carry out his crime at home, or that is in the way of execution.
For four years ago, the court proved to Germany that he regularly moved the government money to the accounts of business in Panama.
These companies were fitting and accounts belonged to its family and closest staff.
Some of these money then ended in the fund that Germany founded on financing his election campaign in 2001.
So they accepted our budget.
That's right.
The State budget was accepted.
What is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget established by this government and accepted coalition without support of opposition.
This year, the latest has passed with the support of the CSSD because the Minister of Sabbath and the CSSD had prepared him to be unable to allow his failure.
This time there was no dramatic debat before voting on the unbelieving government.
The sentence's snippet of this traditionally overviewed, although the most effective, the law was approved in peace.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individuals and budget items, or does not like it to someone.
Starting is a fundamental part of the policy, but it is to follow the powerful support of the government with opposition.
This is medically more grateful, and it is therefore more attention to him in the media.
Political search is much more interesting for public than a high number.
State budgets in the past socially democratic government have suffered by three diseases that could not be resolved immediately for 2008:
It is a high part of the obligational law, such as mandatary expenditure, which is not only income but also in social doses that have approved the silence of CSSD and KSCHM in the past year before elections.
Second of them is deficiency as a result of the first deficiency.
The third limit is the deficit of public funds, such as the deficit of the budgets of cities and communities.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the State budget.
It's public and relatively under control.
However, the timely bomb is the deficit of the budgets of cities and communities.
Many employees to obtain other resources for investment, especially granting obligations to which their officers were unexpectedly debt, except money, taxes and credits from bank.
In the past years, they were allowed to pay these debts to the mass sale of energy and other divorce networks that they received from the State in privatisation.
They don't have this resource now.
We'll only keep the official and verifying facts, we'll make sure:
Our economy has spent a few years, as the rest of the world, a growth phase, which continues to glorify the CSSD.
It was a unique opportunity to give public funds to her governments.
However, the state was still more debt in place.
Other countries, even a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have exploited much more understanding than our Republic.
It's a big deceit that falls mainly on the past government.
We belong to the countries which are, globally, at least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes that, despite the recent years, have been completely increasingly in gigantic dimensions.
Although it has been possible to cancel the part of the unintentional popularist expenditure approved years before elections, so if there is no time to move the outcome limit to the pension and pension reform, then any policy in this country will end, and any of them will only be governed.
With a small surprise, it is said that the Governing Policy becomes officers, mechanisms that divide the amount of money given to income and social doses.
Therefore, it cannot be an aeroplane of revolution, but it can only stop the expenditure of normal expenditure to the mandatary.
The planned deficit of 70 billion per 2008 would be absolutely incompatible if the past governments had not been involving in the last ten years.
If we don't want the fact that the Governing Policy is to be officials, then we must be patient and too strong to this extreme coalition government, which realizes that the State can only issue the amount of taxes and payments that will be able to gain, the calm to prepare other reform laws.
Only these will enable the progressive achievement of the balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on financial markets.
In the monetary markets, more than 100 billion dollars will be obtained by the monetary markets.
In these cases, the banks have a rate paid for which they are willing to pay money.
For example, the American Fed will send to $40 billion, and the additional $40 billion will be available to the European and Switzerland Central.
It is after the attacks of the eleventh September first that the central banks of individual States have agreed on such coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is to solve the largest economic movement, so the increased lack of freedom that banks could pay," he wrote in his report to Bernard Baumohl clients from the Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the central banks reduced the probability of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to fifty per cent," added Baumhl in his report.
The banks have already arrived about sixty billion dollars for unpaid payments, especially in the United States.
Analytics expect more billion losses.
"The central banks must have a real fear of what can still follow when they have decided for this process," said the main economy ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems to be really bad," added.
The Central Banks are concerned that if banks have the same difficult access to payments, they will also pay their customers.
This would reduce the need and send the US economy into recession with potential impact on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks decided so after it had not been able to reduce the rate of LIBOR, the Londry Interbank rate used for payment of money on the inter-bank market.
This means that the banks were still concerned about the mutual payment of money, even though the United States, Canada and the British Central Banks had decreased sometimes during the summary of their amounts.
"It will have the same effect as the further reduction of rate rates," said agency Re日s Greg Salvaggio from the Tempus Consulting company.
Some analysers do not believe that the step of the central banks contributes to the blessing of the crisis because they do not solve a fundamental problem, and that is the fall of the market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecological debates are incredible
Global climate changes are most vulnerable to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus reacted to the problem of global temptation.
The criticism has now come to the end of the United Nations international aircraft changes on Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, never the Green Planet, he noticed that the ecological debates were incredible.
According to Klause, it is not only acceptable to the structure of Âe, which creates a miraculous mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but also the main division between the retoric which it is carried out and the reality.
"The work is completely unstructured there, it's just a fireway of words that are refunded for the solution of the current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech Chairman under the presentation of his book highlighted that her theme is very important for it, and therefore it is so involved in them.
He also expressed satisfaction on the fact that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I sometimes only meet my opinions."
Now, the interesters can read his undesigned positions.
Klaus recalled that it was not a climatologist, but, according to his opinion, he had enough provisions to write such a book.
It is also academic, able to follow and examine professional negotiations, has experiences with and is also a national host.
The main conclusions of the book indicated that climate continues to change and its changes are, therefore, normally, that there is no coherent view of all participants that the results of the current changes are not too large and serious and that they do not represent a threat, and that the efforts to affect the development of the climate are unsuccessful, ineffective and inacceptable.
Moreover, as a man with totality experiences, he considers an unacceptable injury of unprotected views to others, which feels a dangerous limitation of freedom.
The questions of the presents repeatedly explained that it was not against "the reasonable protection of life, but against the military environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and their uses".
The same theme was Klaus in Vienna for two months ago in the Hayeco Institute.
The rider couldn't change 600 thousand people.
Seven hundred thousand drivers have expired the time and have not been able to change the old driver's evidence, which will expire its validity at the end of the year.
Today, it is the last day when people can ask for exchanges to continue to come to the end of the year to make a new proof.
The Ministry, however, fears that after the New Year, they would be issued on the road of driver statistics without valid authorisation.
According to the offices, those who don't want to drive were not mainly changed.
While the foreign reports a decrease in the interest of the driver's exchange, the offices in the metropolis are requested and the exchange of shows has increased this week.
The Magistrat releases about 2000 clients daily.
The fronts are waiting for a half hour.
In Praza, a driver's show hasn't changed about 140,000 drivers.
The building of a new show takes twenty days.
But it's possible to ask for issues for a decreased period of five days.
In that case, but the driver will pay five hundred corners.
The engineers who will have to change the show will not reach the end of the year and go out on the street without a valid driver will be threatened from January.
The manufacturer will pay a maximum of two thousand corners.
But the police officer can resolve the contract.
In the case of a administrative crime, the craft is exposed to 2500 crowns.
According to the previous information, it could have been able to get comfort from the officer and the person who would not go anywhere.
It was evidently able to pay 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry first invited the authorities to be peaceful and to store the highest thousand coronary destruction.
According to the Department of Transport of Karla Hanzelky, the tenths of temptations will not threaten anyone.
The ridge show is according to the evidence that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a civil proof that everyone must have valid.
People who don't want to drive anymore have to give a driver's show.
It is sufficient to be taken or sent by a recommended mail to the competent General Authority.
Without the end of the year, they will stop paying the evidence issued in 1964 to 1993.
The motorists have to be gradually exchanged by other types of drivers.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have been exchanged for three years.
The validity of evidence issued in 2001 to 2004 will be completed in 2013.
According to Hanzelky, it's about 2,6 million other documents.
The Court reduced the criminality of the detectives associated with Berdych
Ancient police officers Joseph Opava and Peter Hornaryk, who are accused of a criminal association with David Berdyh gang, will go to thirty and ten years of proceeding.
With the definitive validity of this, the Court of Auditors decided that they had so decreased the penalty, one per year and two years.
P was threatened to the detectives of the Prague Committee for the fight against organised crimes 14 and 12 years.
In contrast with today's decision, it is possible that only a permit to the Supreme Court may be revoked.
Although Berdych is also regreted in this box, he is just waiting for the original valuation.
However, in other processes, he has already been sentenced over 16 years.
He can't get more.
In January, the Court of Justice recognized, in particular, the deceased overcome of 19 guilty persons, today the high court has decided to revoke 16 of them.
The majority of the accused accusations since the beginning of the investigation refused to refer to the designed cow.
According to the Mediterranean Senate, police members, after agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police resources to criminals, covered individual offences and helped the members of the gang to avoid criminal responsibilities.
Gang gave 30 percent for that from the lump for Opava and Heaven.
Unfortunately, the crime of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the victims who have often suffered serious health interest, but also the disuse of the power of the public factor and unleavened weapons.
In the home views, the police discovered illegally holding guns, shoots with ocean nuclear, laser spectators, or self-break.
Gang, according to the accusation, came with a tithe of million crowns.
Furthermore, twenty men in this process have already been authorised by the judges to be guilty of other Berdish and many other people.
Other men of Berdish around are still talking before the court in another process, some cases haven't passed before the court yet.
The vote of the calculation has then been denied to Tomás Poth and Maroshi Schulejo, who are killing in the Irish Liaison, where they expect the definitive decisions on their issue to move to the Czech Republic.
Replace for children: 12 million
In replacement of children in the family, Igor Veleba's lawyer wants a damaged family, after a treasure hospital, 12 million crowns, plus a court exhibition.
For each mother of three million, for fathers by two million, and for children per million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The Representative of the Sickness of Ondréj Dollar is therefore not primarily agreed with Veleby.
"That is the request we reject, it's a lot high," said the Stay after today's negotiation.
"And they could have made a view of the opposite, we've made a finding trial that the opposite could have made.
We'll find out if he has a corresponding value.

The polytheater came to the Valash Kingdom
Polívka's disease has spent the sign of the Valash Kingdom.
According to the Court of Auditors of the Court of Justice, he first used the marking of the king of Vallas, but the project built an annual work team around Tomás Harabishe, who was working with the herd.
The polytheist hasn't participated in negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, the cousin probably doesn't end and the client's calling.
"The speech is that Mr. Harabish and his team are parasitting on the popularity of Bolka Polívky," the lawyer said after the process of Polyvkov.
According to the words of the Valash Kingdom, everyone will save just herce and comic.
It's the same view of Harabish.
"There's almost ten years of work behind us.
Spending money and thinking of actions," he said.
According to the cause of money.
"In years, they realized that the project was successful and could have something from it.
They want to parasite our job," added.
Lucrative Business
According to the Court of Justice, the king of Wales first used Polivka in his television order.
In 1993, Radoslav Bzobohati coronated her heritage.
But then it did not have the purpose of building a fiktiv kingdom.
About a few years later, Harabish came with the idea of publishing the Valley Passs.
From the pc recessist action, trade and lucracy was embraced by the business activity in which Harabish then charged the company of the Valash Kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed with the introduction of his name and signature in the fish, and even offered their slew holders when visiting his farms and divade representations.
Who's sitting on the throne?
The Court also stated that Harabish used only a holou idea that Polivka published in a manner for his business purpose.
"The Popularity of Boleslava Polívky's project of the Valash Kingdom has certainly helped," she said to the judge.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team that was intensely acting on him.
The cooperation of the devastated parties today continued until 2000 when Harabish for Polyvka organized the official coronation in Vestine.
Since that time, however, between Polyva and Harabish began to shame the consequences that had been sent to the meeting of the "Ray of Boleslava I. chosen for furt".
Then the leader role in the kingdom took a song of Jarmila Shulaak as a king’s mother.
In 2002, Polívka then granted Harabishe and his company the claim that the court has rejected today.
Clearly, Harabish could bring a lack of clothes on the throne and half of the princess.
The new king should go out.
The details and the termin hasn't yet wanted to make sure.
"We don't want to succeed.
It should be something like the king's leader in Slovakia.
The king should be free for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also be quietly added," added Harabish.
Test Peugeotu 207 SW 1.6 VTi: monthly prejudice
Really, I never found too much Peugeoto 206.
His leading properties were nothing too much, the quality of management, management, and also the production would be marked as a medium-sized leckdy.
But on the market is now the representative of Peugeot 207, and he's a lot better.
And the SW's a truck is still about a cup on the other side and I'm not left to think better.
When I tested the classic hachback of Peugeoto 207, for example, I moved to room on the backsite.
This is now the end, because the carories of the combi means that they will suffer either two-meter long in this direction.
The Year of the World
I'm going to go too much to not get back too much.
It's about the whole design, where I have the only outcome to the poor central tunnel.
Here I'd evaluate something more designer invention when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are convenient, and those are the times when we could move to a short seat or a seat.
The side management also improved explicitly against model 206.
Whatever in the room, it's also here to feel the growth of the career dimensions.
Then in the truck, the lack of space is already mentioned above the head.
Cowry for coffee
That's the main thing on this vehicle, then, he's his liability.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (and also thanks to the background window) and as a whole-compliant.
The loud places are equipped with detention gums, which are ideal compromise.
It doesn't suggest that it should be spread, and then he will keep the worse items.
But let's stop together over the volume.
This is according to the table in the basic range of 428 l, which is more than the average value of competition.
However, not against the most selling vehicle in Czechland - Fabia Combi's damage.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of young boyslave product, then we see that Peugeot is a lot of 52 litres.
This value shall be critical for the allowed in the cart or when the cart is loaded.
But if I had to highlight the positive, I still need to mention the entirely equivalent ground after the second line or very low loop.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a firewall of 1,6 l with 88 kW.
And to say the truth, that's what a sixth girl should look like, who's going to take a family hachback.
She's quiet, she's a little demand, and he's in the main place.
It's just compared to the damage period that leckdy's acting as if she had a pulled hair to the exhaust, so I can only be overcome.
The price shall be covered
The price of the car is not human.
However, we need to remember that we have tested the vehicles with a space-internal and very good engine.
The basic price of the vehicle with the fire quarter at 329 900 Kč will be left.
Our attachment is from 410 900 Kč, which is enough.
The tested equipment of Premium will then come to the equipment for the additional 80 000 Kč proposal.
Since we had the main airbags, the automatic climate, the automatic launch of the drivers, the electric control of the back windows...
It's just a car all over here, 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but calculate the additional equipment at Fabie and get to a lot of similar numbers.
So there's nothing to decide for the label.
The integration of the Slovenian jackets at the British Schools does not occur
In British schools, children from Eastern Europe, which calls for further development of local education in local residents.
The integration of the WhiskedodoEuropeans is still increasing for a series of interruptions.
British schools even register the cases in which the conflicts between the inhabitants and the kids of the pools are growing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe at the British Schools is well illustrating the case in North Kent, where they begin to deal with conflicts between local residents and Slovenian attendants.
Hardness, shickens and rubbers have also been transferred into relatives between parents.
The situation went so far that the police held a Slovenian woman in Chatham, who was driving a 10-year-old jail.
She's noticed that the boy had hurt her with racist advantages.
The police had to include two native girls on the Slovenian accommodation.
The girls of the men were evidently shared with racist notes and shot on rocks.
"When we went home, the boy split out on the bus stop and started running on us.
When I told him to leave it, he fired the jackets and the craps on us, and then discovered his back," she described another unfair income for the Times' mother of the Slovenian jackets.
The difficulties are on both sides.
One of the local residents even signed the conflict with the hosts from Eastern Europe for the battle of survival.
All of these cases indicate that the atmosphere at the British schools between local and attendees begins to be pressured.
In British, 70 thousand Slovakians have been recorded here for work.
A total of 30 thousand Slovenian jackets then visits the British schools.
Cuba Caribbean's most beautiful island
It's a real island of freedom for the visit.
Whatever you expect from your allowed, it can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
Gold and white beach, high wheels, or sea, quiet as a fisherman.
Palmy and all included with cocktails offering on pizz, frozen and cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf a ruleta.
On the Caribbean Islands, you will find it in a full and more rich account.
Only on one island, but you'll find a lot more and this island is Cuba, the biggest and beautiful of the Great Antils.
For Spain was Cuba the garden of their inhabitants in America.
Columbus named her as the beautifulest place that the human eye looked at.
Havan became the storage and transfer of the stocks that Spanish in America had taken and transferred to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel National grows at the end of 20 years.
He allowed him to set up one of the American Mafia Lucky Luciano Mafia boss, because everything that was in the United States crime (in particular for ́ce), was welcomed and supported by drugs, hazard, prostitution.
Among his guests were my.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Hawaii, the houses were grown, and after the wide bullwars, a car was driven to the cultural symbols of the past 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway buyed a apartment in San Francisco de Paul, a bathroom from Havana, and in Coyemar he had his jachto.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signatures of the showbusiness stars and politicians from all America.
What about today?
On the walls in the Haven Bodeguite, you can leave your autogram and you.
In the bar of a loved hotel, the Nationals have a cocktail for your desire.
And these 50-year-old cars are running to Hawaii, because sometimes imported wheels and fiathes in that sweet and volcano have been snippet for a long time.
It's Havan, especially her oldest part, that's significantly discovered, but there's nowhere in the surroundings so beautiful colonial memories as right there.
Other places also change in beautifulness, perhaps Trinidad.
Since the way of movement offers so many needed money, its development has green.
In the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Hawaii, but especially in Varadar, in Holguin and in the islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and other.
The Cuba offers another book that is unique in the world and evaluates it, in particular, by the bottles.
A thirst of the spread plants was cut into sugars after the slight railways of parny and engine flashes.
Their car park has not been renewed for many decades, so there are working machines whose stations are elsewhere in museums.
Where to go?
This most famous place is the visit of Kuby's non-min.
And that's about Varada, or Hawaii, it's not too much to describe.
I hope just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway's residence is a museum and who has this writer, he shouldn't let his visit go.
Valley Viňales One of the smallest corners of Cuba is the valley Viňales on the west of the island.
The gross vegetation grows from the vacuum base.
The potatoes, the vacuum holes and the rocks arose from the bottom of the valley, and in their duties there are a gross winter, thus the wind scale is covered by a hot growth.
The valley is a place where the most qualitative cuban tape is grown.
With his final similarity, you can meet if you visit some of the Haven Fabrics for the production of researchers.
Maybe someone's gonna be interesting, and it's that the Chile part of the Earth was running there.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded a little after Spanish colonizing the islands.
The glory and richness brought him trade with slaves and sugar.
The riches were transformed into the beautifulness and splendidness of a small city.
The colonial Spanish characteristics, extremely affected by the French major staff, have not changed within four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the burning of Escambray, is so deceived that in the past 50 ’ s there was no way that would connect that country to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay on the side.
Nothing happened there, and that's why nothing happened, everyone had a shot over his head.
If a person has more time at Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking for it to the interesting places in the nearby area, such as Playa Ancón beach, or the valley of Sucrovar.
Then the evening looks like to go to Casa de la Musica, who lives after the seed and the music in it is stronger than the over.
Baracoa
The city on the east of Cuba some are the most beautiful in the island.
The effect of such a view affects the way itself.
Both roads that are leading from Guantanama must convince the high and the mountains members and prosecute the nature that human activity has not yet mentioned.
The Universal Cuba Island wrote UNESCO thanks to the dark uninterrupted nature to the list of world inheritance.
They do the best chocolate there, in the coast of May Ko's cross (inÃ©lÃ©stÃ©t up a hundred years after the Columb floor) and from the coast where there is some room and today the hotel of El Castillo, is to see a few board mountains from which the most known is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, scientists, the fire of Sierra Maestra, the village of Sweet and the island Isla de Pinos, the cabaret of Tropican, the sanctuary of the Cuban patrons Caridad del Cobre, the sanctuary, the African religions, which recognises the descendants of some of the slaves, all of this would be described in many pages.
The treatment, as he says right, is better to see once.
Associations in Afghanistan are pas, stated Americans
Small soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affects the mission in Afghanistan according to the United States.
The NATO, according to the Defense Minister of Robert Gates, should plan a specific plan for the next year.
The mission in Afghanistan does not try according to the idea, the representatives of the countries in Scotland have agreed in Edinburgh.
According to a growing opposition from the Talibania movement today, eight involved States also discuss other plans and coordination of associates.
While the United States this week by the Defense Minister of Robert Gatess called the NATO units for a more active activity, the United States see the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghanistan Government and strengthening development assistance.
"The wheat in Afghanistan is mature, but the military force can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to enable the people to initiate further economic and security development themselves," the British Defense Minister for Des Browne said the BBC station.
Ninety-eight percent
The activity of the Afghanistan rebels is higher than the last five years, according to the American Armies' data.
The beginning of violent actions was decreased by 27 per cent last year, even 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
The NATO land has about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, from which the quarter is in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the associates have reached the same limit in the organization and the equipment of units.
In particular, they ask for further helicopters, soldiers and experts for the train of Afghanistan units.
"We'll have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and how to achieve them," said Gates.
In a similar sense today, the general secretary of NATO Jaap de Hoop has also spoken.
"I don't enjoy what we have in Afghanistan on earth and air.
We have approximately ninety percent of soldiers and equipment that they needed, and that's little," said agency Re日s De Hoop for the conclusion of the classic conversations with the Japanese Government in Tokyo.
Who's the Path?
Among the countries involved in the past months, all associates in Afghanistan are also concerned about whether they are the maximum in Afghanistan.
For the passion, for example, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans have a relatively numerous commitment in Afghanistan.
But they are placed in the areas where the minimum violence is and the wars are not as high as we are in the south and east part of the country," said Gates.
The British Sun bulvary magazine this week signed German soldiers for lenox.
"Afghanistans discovered: Germans play, while our guys fight," Sun wrote in the material, completed photos of German soldiers playing tenis.
The German Image passed into the opposite and printed the picture of the British unit at the ragby-shop in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The State duty will be exhausted for a billion in 2009
Each Czech is a State debt over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt went to the end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.
The government planned to pay 159,2 billion crowns for years.
At the start of the Ministry, however, the plan was reduced to 152,8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of the state budget.
The State duty of the Republic of Czech to the end of September reached 842,7 billion crowns.
In nine months of the year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it was decreased by 13,4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has so confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech is a debt over 84,000 crowns.
For the whole latest year, more than 111 billion crowns were charged.
"Instead, it seems that by the lower deficit for the next year, the billion crowns could be convinced until 2009.
The next year the debt should be moved between 900 billion and a billion crown," he introduced the iHNed.cz analytic Patria Finance David Marek for the server.
Similarly, the analysis of Next Finance Vladimir Pikora: "To overcome a billion → they could be reached during 2009.
When it's exactly depending on the next budget that we don't know yet.
It would be demonstrated that political changes would have been made, political willing to further investigate, and that could be moved to 2010.
But I don't suppose this change," he said.
Length to grow
The State debt constitutes the central government's debt and results in mainly the cumulation of State budget debts.
The State debt is financed by post-based liabilities, state debt, direct loans or by funds from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state remained at 38.5 billion years to 719.4 billion crowns.
The debt of the State has grown up by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called State debt at the end of September reached 803,3 billion crowns and from June falled by 13,7 billion crowns.
The average debt of the State debt increased to 6,5 years.
"The total debt for the first to the third quarter increased by 13 per cent, which is very much for the economy.
Interestingly, growth is mainly generated in debt, where growth is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt grows, but on the other hand, it shows that it's going to negotiate when the resource reform is here," said Picor's data.
Better than expected
The financing and management strategy for 2007 shows that the government has planned to pay 159,2 billion crowns for the year.
At the start of the Ministry, however, the plan was reduced to 152,8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of the state budget.
A part of the State budget's deficit, which, of course, will reach 76 billion crowns in place of 91.3 billion crowns.
The following is the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency 13,3 billion crowns, the 10 billion reserve for the payment of revenue, the financing of State debts for 43 billion crowns and the payment of funds from the European Investment Bank in the height of 1,8 billion crops.
The woman has to be delivered to the court today in Chartum for giving the name of the bullet meat.
The British recipient, judged in Sudan for Islam's injury, was sentenced by one Chartum Court on Thursdays and released as he introduced her advocate.
Britain was accused that she had left six to seven years of age to give to the mosquito name Mohamed despite any vision of the prophet Islam is prohibited.
She was detailed by the hurt of the whistle.
This British Fourty-year factor, acting on the University High School in the Southern Chart, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of the injury of Islamic and Rebelian, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudan Court of Justice, after the parents of a number of ages sentence to the Southern Ministry of School.
Our story begins in the month of September, when the teacher concerned requests his six to seven years of age to choose a name for a classic meat.
"From the mouth of the child, the names include Hasan, Abdulah and Mohamed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
After voting in the class, 20 of the 23 children finally chooses Mohamed as the most favorite name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially in Sudan it is a very extensive Christian name.
The children then created a book for their class with a mixed meat with the letter "My name is Mohamed".
He did not have any shadow on himself with this name, but it was in the same manifestation of the prophet that was considered as an enemy to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gi`an Gibbons, who teaches in the same school in Sudan, stated that she knows well and that she would never do anything that could be harmful for any religious faith:"I just claim that she requested the children to vote for the prosecutor's name," it is according to the only "invisible doubts".
Such views also divide many factors that describe it as "very attention to their jackets" and adds that "never speaks about religion in class."
Remember that the Christian name Mohamed is also the second most often given Christian name in Great Britain, which is written in English in fourteen different ways.
This Christian name often chosen by the Muslim family represents the way to worship the prophet (often is given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules concerning the use of this Christian name?
For example, is it possible to give them a player?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
On the last round of negotiating this center in Vienna, the future status of the province did not reach agreement.
Finally, failed.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanians ended in the middle of the Russian Baden sixth and the last round of discussions, unless they could convince different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is political that both parties were not able to reach the status agreement," stated the European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during the printing of Viden.
His American prosecutor, Frank Wisner, highlighted that the peace in it was "in the square" and called Belarus and Pristina to take care of their commitments to maintain peace and were also ready for the dialogue after the end of negotiation.
"We don't expect violence at the nearest time, but we're going into a demanding period," he added, "is evident that it's insufficient."
The negotiation ends 10.
Three negotiators, composed of the representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be sent to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90% of the Albanian speaking population would be shown in a clearer light to 10th, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Chartchenko has to conduct its message to the United Nations Security Council.
The discussions in Baden, nearly Videa, represent the sixth and the last trial of negotiation since the United Nations, in August this year, confirmed the new negotiation.
The Americans and Europeans are calculating that the discussions will be completed in 10.
The Russians who have already blocked the independence of Kosovo in the United Nations Security Council in contrast with the market to continue the negotiation after the most determined term.
"The Russia was and remained inclined to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Bocan-Chartchenko.
A single statement of independence?
After eight years of administration of the international community, the West considers the independence of Kosovo under the supervision of the EU as a single coherent solution.
The Priscity declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its benefits, it is prepared to report unilaterally.
The white road takes an expanded autonomy.
"Well, we have not reached any agreement," reported the President of the Kosovo self-submission Fat · Seidiu in the research hotel, where this "Last chance has been done since Monday."
Hashim Thaçi, an ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-alban Albancians and the future Prime Minister of the province, expressed trial.
However, he added that the plan of autonomy represented by the Belarus 'is the past that led to murder and deportation'.
"Dominal Effect"
The Serbian President Boris Tadic, contrary, believes that the compromise is still in consideration and warned the Albanian population in Kosovo before the investigation of an unilaterally stated independence of the province.
The Belarus is, in particular, fearing the "domein effect" in the Âa, which is still stable in the outcome of the war for independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, however, it doesn't mean it," he said, "the compromise is impossible."
The Serbian Delegation continued to take place any decisions exclusively to the Security Council in which its Russian association has the right of veta.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia is only acceptable for the solution of the Security Council," stated the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"That's been two years of negotiation.
It must end as it started: on the ground of the Security Council."
The journalists Fat` Sedjiu replied that "the last word of status will have the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there were a single statement of independence from the Albanian speaking people, it would be "with the western agreement".
Bush was able to go down in Israel and the Palestinians
At the start of the International Peace Police in Maryland, called from his pope, the American President George Bush announced that the Israelites and the Palestinians finally agreed on a common declaration.
He noted that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian president Mahmud Abbás agreed on the immediate initiation of a negotiation with an intention to solve 60 years of dispute between both nations.
In the presence of both Bush's men, he promised that he would do everything to help them close the "Peace with" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the "Terrorist Infrastructure" and Israel must join the colonial activities, declared Bush and remembered the commitments that both sides gained from the "sto-map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House highlighted that the negotiation between Israel and the Palestinian self-administration leading Abbase has the goal of "the conclusion of the peaceful withe, which would still resolve all undetermined issues without exception, which are, in principle, the issues of the center."
This statement includes three issues that are in the nuclear conflict between Israel and the Palestinians: the future border of the Palestinian, the status of Jerusalem and the judgment of the arabic rebellious ones in conflict in 1948 from their homes in the country of today of Israel.
Abbas took the words by the American President and focused on the following negotiations "total and valuable" and to touch all aspects of the solution, by changing the "Jerusalem, surroundings, borders, colonies, water, security, otherwise".
Then Olmert went up to the court, who said that the next negotiation should be "right and continual" and that it should be "required to be closed in 2008".
Bush determined the end of 2008 as a term of follow-up of his "see of two States", Palestinian and Israeli, existing near itself.
The Saudi Arabia made a commitment from Bush in this sense yet before she decided to take place.
The Saudi Arabia, whose appreciation in the police is successful for Washington, started to be accepted by all Arab countries that offered Israel a peace exchange for the release of all Arab territory for war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Police means "the crossing in the Mediterranean, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", judges the prince Saudi in the interview, which has provided to one Arabic speaking journal of Saudi.
According to the prosecutor, the police don't have a responsibility.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As this is in such a great report from black cronicas, the official versions do not agree with what is spoken among people.
What are the circumstances of accidents?
According to the first reviews of the investigation General inspection of the French State Police (Inspection General de la police national, IGPN), the police car passed on Sunday after 17 hours after Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
"The tissue was not in the lamp regime, but it was on the watch and passed from 40 to 50 km/h, but the side light had not been activated," explains the police source.
The Green Motorcycle of Kawasaki, "not registered, and therefore without permission to walk on public communications" (read below), driving two young people without adjunction, passed through "very high and high."
"The motocycle went on the left side to the police car after he didn't have the right front," said one police officer.
The test of alcohol in the blood conducted on the vehicle holder was negative.
The state of the car (foreground, scratched front, broadcasts) shall testify of the frequency of the pressure.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry had already announced that the IGPN had confirmed the investigation of "insensitive murders and non-profit assistance to persons in threat", which is also addressed by departmentale de la securityèque du Val-d'Oise (Department of the National Police department Val'Oise).
In the event of the afternoon pressure, the prosecutor noted that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excludes the responsibility of police officers for accident.
Three testimony accidents that were detailed to hear on Sunday evening, according to the office confirmed "the version of police officers, that the minimum engine has drawn close to them with the left."
As a rice, which certainly caused by the third clipsen on the ground, last night she showed that the two vehicles remained locked up until the police car was able to quick.
The vehicles were guaranteed and they're going through the technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were made a drink yesterday.
What happened right now?
Wednesday in Villiers-le-Bel, the people broadcast the story that the police had to leave the place of action without giving the first help to two young people.
IGPN should also, in all caution, exclude "every serious prosecution" in this point.
"This is the most important aspect of investigation, which requires more monitoring and must be very careful," the police resource.
The "Libération" journal met the clear witness for a few moments that followed after a disaster.
One of his windows, at the same time, looks right there where the accident was played.
"We are immediately together with the sisters who are a sister in the hospital, running down and trying to resurrect them," says the witness.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he looked at the "cool, completely scared police officer.
Two other people tried to resurrect one of the young ones and the fourth talked to the phone."
The faces in the face of the growing attempt and certainly present that the young people are unfair, the police were taken by the colleagues who arrived to the place.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "age twenty minutes after the police went away."
They also made the heart mass, but married.
"Never believe that the police authorities did not contribute to the help of young people.
These young people were given the first help.
The Hastics got once.
For their salvation, everything was done," the prosecutor highlighted.
Insight in Pakistan grows
The Pakistanian police took the first demonstration on Monday from the declaration of the exceptional status by General Musharaf, two days ago.
In Lahor, on the east of the country, approximately 2000 lawyers who demonstrate the measures adopted in the exceptional condition were hurted by the granates with silver gas, which, according to the Witnesses, were used in order for the powers.
The last names answered the rock that some of the police were hurt.
At least 350 lawyers were called.
Similar scenarios like in Karakh and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and hurt the lawyers.
A few of them should have been called.
In Islamabad, the Almighty Court lawyers called after the general staff and announced demonstrations, due to about five hundred opponent arrests, fighting human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
The streets of access to the Supreme Court were replaced on Monday with a view to prohibition of pollution.
Other demonstrations were to run in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (severowest).
On Monday, the vote of the lawyers of the support of religious parties purchased in the political strong aliance Muttahida-e-Amal, whose president "invited a people to send the flowers to the judges who were against the exceptional status, and the wastes to those who had made a swear by Musharaf."

Watchful work of the universe station
More than seven hours of work in the universe needed astronaut Scott Parazynski and its members from the International University Station (ISS) to be careful for the reality of the solar panel that was necessary for the next station.
There was a risking outcome to the universe, which collected records in terms of duration, distance from resident modules, and the measures of "compatibility" which astrons have been charged.
Difficulties occurred in a distress, while astronomy of Discovery's ship exposed the Harmony Module, a large military force designed for the installation of European and Japanese workers (see paragraph).
This module is an adjusting mole for modules-laborators.
But you must be able to get electricity.
The second task of the post was, therefore, to move a seventy-seventh-year-old aircraft module that produces electricity using solar panels that have already passed on the ISS, so that it can cover its final fixation.
After she moved her, the seat started to spread seventy meters of the module solar panels.
And in that was one of the panels which were divided as a wallet, in the outcome of the cab, injured on the floor of one meter's illness.
The exhibition was stopped to prevent the further damage of the panel.
Astron; who had to carry out the control output on the Discovery ship, and then going to fix another solar panel, which was injured by the rotation system, were required to handle the damaged panel.
And it was just Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic brain of the ship, added to the station's branch, and performed the right.
It's one of the best "spacewalkers" (inquired walk) of the American Airport and University Agency (NASA).
High, powerful, very turning, he has a very worked hair and a long watch.
In its 46s, this pp was confirmed by the doctor's appointment by "operating" the "founded" solar panel.
After a detailed examination of damage, he shot the wallet and fell to the damaged place of the "dlahy".
He helped him the second "spacewalker", who stayed near the balance composition, as well as outside, the final astronautes, including Peggy Witson, the main department.
The tools that he used, the minihokeick, with a beauty of isolation, to protect the electron shock on solar panels that produce some hundred turns, found and produced astronone on the station's cart.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely distributed and then inventory his tools and returned to the internal station.
Last afternoon, astrons enjoyed a middle-day rest before today when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return in the middle of the planned land.
EADS actions are weak
The EADS action will be sensitively lost at the Paris Board, after this company operating in the air and defense industry noted that it would have to lose 1,2 to 1,4 billion euros to end the A400M airport.
EADS lost 4 % and now it is at Paris's bourgeois at 21,96 euros.
The financial group was required to review its proposed production results for 2007 as a result of the late procedure of the development of A400M aircraft, which is a subminous starting year.
The price for late reduction in military cost airports, reported in October, was calculated "1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than billion for Airbus," reported the EADS's mother firm.
For these expenditures, the EADS will be required to report a new view of profits before receiving rates and taxes (EBIT).
The group also made that the new cost estimation corresponds to six months later.
Remember that the EADS production results in 2006 fell by 86 %, especially because of the costs associated with the latest programme, which is A380 airport.
The P-Group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M airport was assigned in October 2009.
Decisions for status quo
Sunday elections will be run without a warm expectation: Russians will choose the President Putina, the United Russia.
Confirming that, after finishing only a very few free pre-optional campaigns, their movement to stability, to authority.
Today, three days before the elections to the lawyer's record, the Russian President Vladimir Putin will communicate to the electors in public legal states a predicted television message, which, however, has been held secretly.
It does so from the position of the United Russia leader, the procurement party, which, according to all, celebrates the victory.
When he accepted the prospects of foreign states yesterday, the president of the country didn't let anything out to come out and satisfied the next attack on the West accused of mixing - his favorite subject during the campaign.
"We know the price of the right democracy and we take honestly, which may be the most transparent and involving options, the options without self-speaking on beautifulness," he added.
It's not far away in the eyes of opposition.
They revoke the campaign with different pressures.
The leader of the communists Gennadij Zjuganov says, "never have passed such shopping choices, nor for Jelcina."
After repressed demonstrations from the last week, the former world master in the Garry Kasparov Shak, sentenced for five days for illegal demonstration, has continued to be invited by his advocate.
"Russians remained mental homo sovietica"
In the background of the following parliamentary elections of simplified expectations, two far more open questions are profiled:
- "Who's going to become the Representative of Putin in the President's office?
The Official Journal published the date of the first round of the Chairman's election on 2 March 2008; the public candidates may be represented by 23st.
Vladimir Putin, selected in 2000 and reselected in 2004, cannot strive for the third mandate in order.
Nevertheless, no follower is revealed.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be a Prime Minister?
Or the leader of Parliament and the universal parties of the United Russia, who chooses the Government and the President?
Whatever it be, the dismissing governing power wins all of them in the parliamentary, as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"Russians have remained mentality homo sovietic, it doesn't feel to be his masters," he thinks the sociologist Lev Gudkov, manager of the independent center of Levada.
History Nikolaj Kopossov from the State University in Sankt-Peterburg has a timely remote relationship: the citizen society has taken, in this country five centuries after Europe, afterward; that glorious common spirit has lacked the creation of individualism.
After liberal reforms of the ninety-years "Putin called on the patriarch model of the state, the population finally accepted, rather than that this new patternism did not cause terror, but a certain economic welfare," Mary Lipman from Carnegie's opinion.
The Russians today "freely delivered the personal responsibility" which they quickly showed after the SSSR spending.
"What do you think?"
This phenomenon is related to all Community levels, including the trade world.
The official elite also intends to maintain status quo: 65 Persons (of the total number of 85 leaders of Russian regions) conduct the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms transferred from West are often like in the ninety-years, a synonymous chaos.
Public amendment gives priority to the stability.
Moreover, in the name of the Russian stability, they will call extremists.
Closed Tamary Cheredniczko, fourty-five-year Professor: "How do you think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why do they change them?"
Hard memory
After more than sixty years in the trusted regime, the Nazi regime of Bad Arolsen, which is condemned by 17,5 million of Hitler's victims, opens the public.
47 million of documents recorded at the length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were available only for "humanitary" at this time, which means individually and namely, for the request of former victims or its rightful persons.
The eleven states conferred by the management of the Germany, France, Israel and the United States were agreed in May on their opening to historicals and historicals.
Since the process of this Agreement is at the end of all States, the opening of yesterday has been possible.
Significant information
The free access of historicals to Bad Arolsen will enable you to examine "specially the movement of the camps, the population of the camps and the health status of the workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these members, managed by the International De la Croix-rouge, CICR.
Until recently, there were several States, including Germany, against access to these named public documents, because of a sensitive weight of some information.
What homosexuality or mental position of some deportation victims are supposed.
The registers of concentration camps or staff composed by Gestape have been conceived after the war to find deported or necessary civil citizens in detail, to bring them evidence of their internation with a view to opening the road of their damage.
More than 300 persistent employees in Bad Arolsen still have tenty individual requests.
However, for the part of the community, the access to Bad Arolsen is only an important contribution.
"Nothing of these documents can't be expected primarily new," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Antisemitism of the Berlin Technical University in 2006.
EU and India want to target free trade in 2008
Currently, the bilateral trade between Europe and India has already reached 60 billion euros annually.
The EU is the first business partner of India in order to represent 18% of its business trade.
In 2008, the European Union and India expected a signature with free trade, reported the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian prosecutor Kamal Nath.

The EU is the first business partner of India in order to represent 18 % of its business trade.
The EU is also its first investor, but, according to the European Commission, India is the nineth trade partner of the EU.
"The Free Trade Agreement exceeds both economics" and "India gets better access to the market of 450 million prospering Europeans," Peter Mandelson added.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported in India, the European Commissioner. The Asian and European Gigant, together, changes "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", declared this week, the head of the European Commission's delegation in New Dilli, claiming that the bilateral trade "not yet reached all its potential". The EU and India are meeting on the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Dilli, for the primary of Manmohan Singha and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosy.

UMP (Union for un movement populationire, Human Movement Union) and NC (New Centre, New Centre) are refused to buy socialists (PS) on purchase
The UMP Clubs and New Centers refused on Thursday to discuss the individual paragraphs of the socialist law on purchase, which is equal to the refusal of the text.

PS Jean-Marc Ayrault reported that his club will repeat the presentation of these replies in their completeness in the forms of amending the Finance Act, which will be negotiated in the next week.
The new festival is born
In the outcome of many speculations that C3 Presents in Filadelfia established a new festival, this promotor/producent Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in collaboration with the British Republic of Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is the honour to work with a man who inspired the modern festival movement in America without delay," Charlie Jones from the C3 of the Billboard.com server.
C3 produces the Chicago festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey state is an aeroplane campaign.
Festival should run from 8 to 10 August to a private farm with 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Filadelfia.
Director of the Festival Republic, I know before Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most popular festival agents.
In 1989, reading Festival was taken in the United Kingdom, which annually attached to 80 000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Festival placed Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
It begins in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a partner, also has the care of production, licence and organizational tasks at Glasstonbury Festival, which has a capacity to 177 500 people today.
Charlie Jones from C3 refers to Glasstonbury as a "neinspirativeest event", which he has ever experienced and says that his company and company Melvina Benna are working together to give the region a festival event of Europe.
"We chose as a market Philadelphia and together with Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked in private work and placed a festival in the Centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I agreed with the city and the Commission was motivated and overcome from the project.
Sadly, though, because of the current management of the city, we have put into politics, Charlie Jones adds.
"Freely, we had the opportunity to discuss Melvin Benn, and we wanted to put a great festival on a special place that will lastly serve Philadelphia's people."
C3 Presents in 2005 raised the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago Grant Park, after they came to the festival scene of Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The cross markets made $9.8M and $11.3M for 2007.
Both of these festivals are running in the City.
"The European model of Melvin Benna's festival plays on the outermost, while our festivals are walking in the Green Rooms in the towns," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to deal with both of them in the right way, and they have created as the idea of a foreign festival by Europe and by the city by the United States."
Vineland is located in half road between Filadelfia and Atlantic City.
"Obec Vineland, probably anxious, supports the success of this event," says Charlie Jones.

Montreal Chili to Terminator
It isn't easy to add Hollywood film study to Montreal when the Terminator himself stands against it...
This convinced mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
His mandate, however, is "political" because the California Arnold Schwarzenegger rejects "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall "Gouvernor" in the woods?
"It must be careful, it's a future who decides where it goes.
If he finds the submines in Montreal, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will be the best," he said.
Features for festivals
However, for this moment, Denise Turcotte's priority is the promotion of local film.
She's already started the Oskary's holiday.
At all the festivals of the Western village, whether there are festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattla or San Francisco, it will be about to present chebec movies, to warn them and to ensure that the registers have a discussion.
Everlasting darkness had a good publicity for a few weeks ago at Mill Valley Film Festival 30th.
It will be represented in January at Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is in the offer in Santa Monice and will be presented in November on the 30th year Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month also Quebec represented four shortcommasters and four full night films on American Film Institute Festo.
Does it come at the end of the year on the marathon bar? Experts divided the 'subpresse' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administration year, and the investors have already expected me to get to the traditional maraton at the end of the year.
However, the experts are not so sure that it comes to him for years.
Bank Banif believes that "in statistical view there is a month in the bourgeois to move forward".
However, it is not appropriate to create submissions exclusively on the basis of particularly because they are reported in the current markets, at least short-termly, certain doubts."
These experts do not suggest that the bourgeois has been moved in the last weeks, and it notes that "burzo · markets are maintaining the existence of liquidity that is prepared to invest as regards the lack of guarantee alternatives, especially the strong income effect of returning to quality valuable papers as long as in short-terms".
Therefore, it believes that the bourgeois will have more peaceful progress, never without volatility, "over because there is no known impact on the potential fall of the rate of FED (Facial Reserve System), in view of the high level of the price of the rock and the risk of the inflation pressures."
Javier Barrio, the leader of the BPI banks in Spain, agrees that it is not the right moment for a courageous statement that it will come to marathon.
"There's not too dealing with joy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost approximately 4 % of the maximum values mentioned on 8 November when the index concluded at 15 945.7 points.
However, all experts do not have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analysis, believes Ibex 35 could end a year for something about 16,000 points thanks to the purchasing of the portfolio and traditional pension income to the pension insurance that comes every year at this time.
However, this expert points out that all the years will be a little different, since it thinks that maraton will be before, in the second week after the long-term week in the day of the Institute.
This analysis does not believe that the callatilite would affect the market movement.
Federico Olucha, Analytic Inversis Banco, recalls that we are approaching the technical level and "for this reason, they could observe the reflection of the index, called from the United States reports on the successful crisis on the credit market."
The analysis will be that these results will be moved.
Analytics agree with the selection of titles that care for Ibex to the new maximum quotas.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "the year is a number of powerful titles."
This expert would include both large banks and some building companies in the portfolio, "for when this period comes, the energy sector will be very sweet."
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco assures that adults will go in hand with banking and industrial sector.
Construction firms will also be able to acquire this maraton if it comes to it.
"Acs has been replaced for several months and we hope that other building companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," explains the expert.
The cyclic need will be in the last part of the year in the past, thanks to the increase in sales during the period of holiday sale.
This expert on the other hand will also say very well, even though they are not too busy on the Spanish market.
Five times during seven years
In the last seven years, it was only a month of passion.
At the end of the year, the real marathon passed in 2003, in the administration year when the markets had ended the crisis with a disturbing bubble.
Years when Ibex 35 returned to 28.17%, Ibex mentioned a growth of 6,68%.
We will also see whether 2007 will be in the fifth year of profit (and Ibex has increased by 8.36 % from January) and whether he will have his maraton at the end of the year.
Two hundred bathrooms of the Popular bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Bank Popular decided to modernize the cost of its bathroom.
Total two hundred placed in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These ships operated under the Popular Max mark are a great change for the bank.
Similarly, for the final Spanish entities, because it is the first group that has decided to take such a shock and to put on the continuous time of opening of their flights up to 20.30 hours and to open in Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group, who also sometimes assured that he wanted to continue the opening time of his bathroom, has not yet decided to take this step.
In the meantime, it will conclude an agreement with the Committee on the abrogation of the opening period of 75 % of its shares on the Sabbath for the duration of the opening period on one afternoon, even though it is never for the public.
The results of this experience will be decided by the Popular Bank to join other entities to this initiative supporting the opening period of trade.
That's exactly the goal of the project that the Popular bank had.
Get individual customers who issue their purchases, smaller and medium companys, animals and trades from the selected streets, where they will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these flows throughout Spain during approximately 18 months, because it is not about the opening of new shares but only about the adjustment of existing.
The bank will modernize the rents already in business areas by adapting the customers' profile in individual streets.
This is the length of opening periods completed with other conceptions of the Room and the new, more active design in lighter colours.
Angel River's business manager assures that this restructuring will mean a great investment, but a more valuable staff set, since six employees are able to go to a loan at eight to nine.
The bathrooms will even be equipped for small and medium fire rooms and will also sell non-financial products.
Put an experience for a group.
Bank Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrids.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel River explains.
The gates were selected in the Madrid Streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Don's and Gran Via, and according to River, it seemed to be a happy choice.
The Popular Bank has currently 2.500 bathrooms.
And other 60 specialists for immigrants operated under the Worldocredit mark also have a very very open time and has been opened even on Sunday and on holidays.
PopularMax will follow the BBVA model when a number of its bathrooms offers to sell a large scale of non-financial products.
"We don't want to buy our clients," says River.
They have just agreed with the Telephone on the sale of mobile phones by the external staff.
Telecinco first on the boat doubled its value of Antena 3
We made it.
This is what Paolo Vasile, executive President Telecinco, showed his satisfaction at the end of the trade when he found that the television he conducted doubled its value of Antena 3.
Only one thing showed his joy: 'What hates me is that it happened because they have grown more, but because we are less deceived', he declared.
And then he highlighted that thanks to the weak market, 'We're less.'
Telecinco yesterday completed the trade by 2,54 %.
This profit moved their loss to the next part of the year to 15,66 %.
The value of this company controlled by Mediasetem (52%) for Vocent (13%) so that, according to Bloomberg's data, 4 488,88 million euros.
Her competitor Antena 3, which was decreased by 1,52 % yesterday and totally decreased by 40,5 % since January, has a half value of 2 193,46 million.
The value of the final telecommunication fires, which were evaluated, is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2.518.53 million Prisa (separator Cinco Days) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antena 3 offers, because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how we can influence this on the same market, for which price and how we will evaluate it in investigation.
Telecinco announced last week that it has been calculated for years by convinceing a billion green receipts from the public will become the first TV channel, as Giuseppe Tringali, executive President Telecinco and Publiespaña, which ensures the publicity of the group.
This television channel would aim on 3,6 % above 965,4 million in 2006.
In the first nine months of the year, the pure operation of Antena 3 increased to 1.6 % (and reached 4.4 million), while the pure income of this television increased by 0.7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors on which the analyses are focused on, for the best relative development of Telecinco in the burst, is an increased pay out that has now been maintained: in 2006, this company, already president Alejandro Echevaria, has shared 100% of its profits between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that although it is soon to decide, this coefficient could be changed after the purchase of 33% of the endmol company with its mother company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have announced much more.
For years, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders that we have already increased the value of 33% endmolu.
According to the market analysis in these moments, it shows a certain impact.
Lehman Brothers recently decreased its profits of Telecinco, which was 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
This is why they explain that the estimated increase of income from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
The company also decreased the estimated profit of Antena 3, which was 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
3 points
1st
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both titles mainly on the basis of an increased dividend and a sustainable potential.
2nd.
Caja Madrid: the value of better Telecinco (hromadit) than Antena 3 (keeping) due to its 'readable priority' and the growth of trade.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends not to appreciate them, because it is the "like threats" (the crossed market and the harmful economic abilities).
Congress approved the transposition of MiFIDU valid from 1 November
In conjunction with the parliamentary negotiations which have been completed today by the vote of the Congress on the news of the Senate to the Law, the Government has provided a public hearing of the regulation that develops a new law, in order to enter into force both before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties have coherently highlighted the efforts to negotiate and agree with the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulations of the entities necessary for the functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Trade Act with valuable papers, provides for the modernization of financial markets and strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the supervisory authority of the State Commission for the market with valuable papers (CNMV) and supports cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new provision allows financial advice services as well as specialized companies, physical or legal persons, and creates a new type of fire of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory company (AFI), which are connected to a company with valuable papers, with a board of valuable papers and a portfolio management company.
Furthermore, the range of financial instrument operation systems is extended in order to join the regulated secondary markets multilateral trade systems and internalisation systems of orders to buy the current buyers.
The Law further binds the investment services undertakings to broadcast information on the market on the key aspects of their business profile, risk-based risks and ways of comparison with risks and requires the list of all operations made to simplify the monitoring of the CNMV.
During negotiations in the Trade Commission of the Congress, a number of adjustments was included, among which it resulted that securitised considerations were considered a "compliant" financial tool, in view of the high danger for investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the United States with high risk-hypothetic duties (subpresse).
The transposition of the Directive was also used for legal applications that could be placed in the economy and the management of the business 30 years after the approval of the Royal Decree in 1977, which is subject to the economy refunded professionals.
Similarly, the senate has organized the creation of new professionals in the financial sector, such as the employee who will work outside, which requires the CNMV authorisation and will be able to provide services of trade with products and customers for different investment companys other than.
The harmonised ISC increased by five decades to 4,1 % in November
This indicator, which starts using Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides a preliminary information on how prices have been developed in Spain during November.
Its publication corresponds to the Eurostat and the Central European Bank (ECB) policies to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated for the use of the same process used for the Harmonised Index of consumption prices, but for the use of various methods of statistical modeling for the assessment of information that is not yet available during the publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Action) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only orientable, and therefore it is not necessary to agree with the final data that will enter into identifiance of 14th of this year.
"ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level"
The second president of the Government and Minister of Economic Affairs Pedro Solbes stated that the ISC increase in November to 4,1 % is "the number of time", however, he suggested that the price index would continue in the next months at relatively "height level".
In any case, Solbes in the Congress kiloars stated that "and if this is a positive number", the Spanish inflation difference against the monetary Union is still the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November was less surprising than the previous month when the government did not count with such a high increase.
"We expected a value of approximately 4%," said the Minister of Economic Affairs to the present data today.
Virgin is planning to work with Northern Rock 42 billion euros for three years
Since the mid-September, the Bank of Northern Rock received the crisis and needed to revoke a new credit from the Bank of England, its contributions were over 50 % to 12 billion euros (16.8 billion euros).
The Bank then managed the recruited contributions for more than 25 billion euros, which gradually did not trust customers during two and a half months, even though the government offered a gradual guarantee for these money and continued it to the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who replaces the name of the entity with its business financial mark by Virgin Money, gets around the quarter of the income in the British banks in the next three years, so that it gets the rest of those 18 billion dollars and reaches the target of 30 billion.
A group of magnitude Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom by his ideal public campaigns, will be planned to lose 50 million free (approximately 70 million euros) annually for publicity and marketing in order to achieve its purpose.
The Bank Northern Rock marked this week the proposal of the Virgin consortial, which creates three other companies, as it gives the priority to save them from the bankroot.
Ancient Totany arrested for data corruption practices at the exhibition
The civil garden today has held the current age of the city of Totana (of the People's Party) for its data involvement in corruption practices at the exposure of this week.
Thereafter one of the secretary of the Office and the chair of the local police was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juana Moralese, the current human lawyer, and the time of an elder of the foreign, which, according to the investigated sources of the Cadena SER TV, could be "the main" of the whole company.
Police continues to monitor the buildings of the Council and the Committee on Equipment and does not exclude further involvement in the next hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juana Moralese was accused, the main suspicious of corruption practices in the exhibition discovered at the beginning of this week.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the "lideveck" lawyer Juana Moralese, who was checked, was arrested at the department of Morales' residence with the important documents associated with corruption.
According to the investigated resources, Morales’ data selection is also subject to the signature of the exhibition agreement with a building company exceeding 200 hectares of the land.
Eight people have been arrested at the moment.
Bono adopted a proposal for state in the head of the PSOE tolled candidate and, if they win, president of the Congress
The former Defense Minister José Bono adopted the proposal for the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luise Rodrigueze Zapater to stay in the next general elections in the PSOE candidate office (Spanian Socialists) in Toledo and, if socialists win general elections, the President of the Congress.
Thus, on the print, the secretary of the PSOE for the organization of José Blanco and Bono, after the meeting with Zapater, who has passed south in the federal seat of the party today.
The executive boss of the ex-minist of the executive offer rejected that in the political life it is "important to count with the best" and Bona "is among the best."
He also noted that "yes, it seems," that this policy from La Manchy will be a candidate to the chairman of the Congress if socialists in the future victories.
Bono would, as President of the Congress, replace Manuela Marina, who published its decision on 15 November to notify in the next general elections and to leave its active political career in order to combat climate changes in the University Education.
The former Minister admitted that the President of the Government continued calling on him to return to the top policy that he left for two years ago.
He further stated that as the citizens, who would be the Minister of Economic Affairs, if PSOE wins elections, his side wanted to notify who would be the President of the Congress.
When Bono gets this, he hopes that Snowwl's change to "the houses of respect and never a pleasure or a cry" and intends to "will be more like the citizens."
"No doubt, sometimes, it seems that the only place in Madrid, where there is no peace and peace to speak, is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate has cancelled 26 times at one occasion."
Similarly, he spoke praiseworthy words to the address of the current President Manuel Marina and his "good work" and did not want to imagine himself on his place, so that he would not be reduced to how he indicated what his opposers could think of "home".
Climate propaganda
As regards the movement against climate changes, the unfriendly investigation as well as those who look at skeptics on his responsibilities, as well as those who give priority to other political and social wars, must demonstrate strong coherence.
Moreover, to have a leader of movement, which is the president of the Government like Zapatero, and that this war is more important than fighting the Islamic terrorism and even wants to sign "new with the planet".
This is required to explain why his government’s activities or inactivity have contributed significantly to the non-compliance of the Kyoto Protocol by Spain.
Whoever is responsible for this incompletion in which the sectors have not protected it and why his government, the government of the Republic, has not protected it.
Moreover, it makes it clear to Spain what measures it will take to achieve climate changes.
The companies that will be harmed, which will have to be changed, the energy, individual and collective efforts, we will have to accept and what economic results it will have.
With other words, who sacrifices and who pays for the salvation of the planet.
But we didn't expect such explanations, we didn't even wait.
It's just because it's necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Watching against climate changes, real measures, are unfair.
Love, incompatible and threatening enterprises and private characters.
Even one center of the price of benzine on the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Partie), Zapater seemed to be so riskant in view of the choice that he had so rapidly refused.
In other words, it's about to save the planet so that it doesn't happen anything, clean propaganda, passwords that give any real importance.
Properties, Commissions, Committees, Protocols and new posts.
And with the planet, this man is so beneficial for the electoral campaign, which doesn't even speak, doesn't blame, doesn't require anything, but it's the deceasure of mythicals and exciting it.
It is limited to it to be only the contractual party and does not wish, and they walked on the round and covered with the chairman.
Oldstone and local police boss Totana are arrested for suspicion from corruption practices at the exhibition
As the research resources were informed, the civil garden arrested the age of the city of Totana, the "power" of José Martinez Andreo, the local police head, the secretary of the Office and one host officer, for doubts about the burning of criminal acts at the exhibition.
The senior was arrested in his apartment and transferred to the Officer, where there is now a number of police officers who have also been delivered to the Commission for Education and the Civil Business for Industrial Area and Citizens.
These three prisons arrived at the sixth months past in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during the operation associated with the transmission of ≥ 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the ground, which was appropriate to stop there that Nuaria’s company, after payment of illegal provisions during the last election period, could set up 4 000 homes.
Moreover, two other persons were not arrested, but they were accused of a decreased procedure at the court of the first instance of Totan.
The first six arrested were sent to the court today.
According to the information resources, the previous committee of Totana and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales is investigated.
The next was accused of his former wife, the owner of the reality office, registered today in Totana and his current friendship, who lives in Murcia, the main city of autonomy.
Manuel N. A., manager and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (Province Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and has not been transferred.
The investigation is conducted by a group of criminal acts in the exhibition of an operative central unit of the Civil Garde, whose members other than prison, have also conducted eleven supervisors, a company associated with arrested companies, with the seat in Madrid, Vigu, Murcii, Pontevedre, Las Rosas (Province Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then imprisoned in Totana, and it was in a very famous company owner of the product of a green meat that could be served as a conqueror.
The Nuaria group was convinced by the establishment of the largest residential complex of the city of Totana, which would represent the exhibition of more than 5.000 homes, golf board and two hotels with "spa".
The company obtained 2,2 million quarter meters of the ground, which was overseen, and its project had doubled age with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group creates firms such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which support the market with immunity, Conycase, which is a parking in Coruñ, Venezuela and in the location of Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which is directly marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on propagation, sale and montage of building elements.
And that's happening.
1st
You're not opposed, we're leaving the book of the months, and we may be attacked between other assessments and competitions.
I've got something in my head.
People, life's a change.
Of course, you can come with ideas.
2nd.
Our finish writer sends us this comment from the most important issue of the Finnish news of Helsingin Sanomat (in the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which calls on what the newspapers were printed on November 18, on the same day that there was a statement of Blackburn's criticism:
"The subject of the philosophy was in public debates about tragedy in the school in Jokel.
The hour of victims, the student of the Mediterranean School, quoted in his messages of Platon and Nietzsche's works.
Pekka Elo, a adviser responsible for the philosophy, requested on the pages of Helsingin Sanomat journal that Professors would have a critical position to Platon and claimed that it was not necessary to examine Netzsche in a well-based filosofie course in the Mediterranean Schools."

A colleague shall inform the introduction of a criminal transfer from the Internet to the criminal law:
A. Placement of one song would be a criminal act from six months to one year.
In contrast, when you cut a table in the price less than 400 euros in the trading, it is considered as only a transition (§ 623.1).
B. If you take up to 1000 euros in the trade, it is already a criminal act, but the penalty rate is lower than the download (§ 234 of the criminal law).
C.d will steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still less than for download (§ 244.1)
D. It's less serious to take the rubber than to change compacts.
Participation of the extent has a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of the penalty law) and, in exchange of compacts, the rate would be from six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Court of Justice).
E. Sexual disturbance in employment shall be considered less seriously than the DVD film station under § 184.2 of the criminal law.
F. The non-distribution of films protected by copyright is criminalised from providing pornographic materials to youth (§ 186).
So if my colleague doesn't hurt, he's cut off his hand to someone, and it's right.
4.
My medical medication has a few of his articles on wonderful research named "Pense makes the brain activation, especially if the ends get less."
Or the feelings of the monthly payment of employees depend on how many colleagues it makes.
The investigation was conducted at the Bonn University using magnetic resistance on the tomograph and results are published in the last number of Science magazine.
According to Bernda Weber, the author of the study and the leader group of Life&Brain's neurologic view in Germany: "To the greatest activity has been affected when the research member and his colleague were correctly responsed."
The research work observed that if both succeeded, they received the same payment, the activation was quiet, but when one received a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion requires so many times.
Balkans
Carla del Ponte has eight years of disfellowshipped from the State Procurement of the Court of Justice in Haag a crime from the Balkan War.
Her mandate will expire the end of the year, and Carla will devote the mixed feelings, because the main victory of massacres in Srebranica, where 8 000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader of the Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadžič, are still in freedom.
Their names are in the list from which the documentary film of the Swiss Revisor Marcela Schüpbacha "Karlin list" (2006, Spanish not known), which follows the temptation of a detective triller from Belarus after New York to the work of the Swiss' clergy in the investigation of the offended criminals and the pressure of the relevant states to trace the network.
What assurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance of a vehicle protected by a driver in case of accident. It represents a significant expenditure that depends on different factors such as the box, the status, the heading, the length of the type of driver display, the type of vehicle to be enquired or the use of the apod.
It's just the beginning to have a car.
The choice of suitable vehicle assurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
In the first row, we need to explain what we're talking about.
The vehicle security is an agreement between the security and the security.
This commitment takes the form of a security compliance, which determines that the insurance will receive an agreed adequate amount in a certain height because it will take payment damage in the case of an accurate event.
The insurance price, which is determined in the light of different factors such as the depth, the status, the seed, the length of the drive show, the type of vehicle which is assured or used by the cover.
The insurance companies set their prices on the basis of, so the more likely to reach the havary is the highest rates.
In this regard, as well as 25 years older and women, they must pay less accurately, because they show that they have lower risk index in view of their care.
On the same basis, the insurance company concluded that those who live in marriage are less havary than free drivers.
The way that the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of the driving and the probability of having an accident.
The growth of driving frequency increases the probability.
There are many variables that the security considers when determining the price of a certain.
Therefore, the driver must simplify the ability to choose the assurances that best correspond to his assurance profile.
We will show the most important changes here for the choice of this type or the type of assurance, which will also be a reasonable price other than that of the type of insurance.
Youths of fifty years are met with different accidents, such as a little experience with management and short types of driver demonstration, when they want to take care of the available price.
Although ideal for good covering is a guarantee against all risks, there are also more important variants.
Incompatible drivers can choose a guarantee against all risks with a low-conscience in order to obtain a clear cover of all risks, but more acceptable prices.
This species would suggest that the customer should participate in the replacement of an accurate event.
"The part of the refund of the accurate event that the customer provides will be determined before in order to determine the price of a certainty that will be higher than the lower participation," explains Luis Noguera, the main leadership company of the first Europe in Spain, of the assurance manager on the Internet.
Other options are to make sure that other operators are enlarged so that the customer will strike against the damage caused by other persons, but not against damage in his own car.
Moreover, he would be assured against steel, fire, and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendation.
You're the youngest twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid the havary as possible, because it's because your bonus and allows you to reduce the safe in the future.
Bonus is the reduction of the basic rate which the assurance company has.
In contrast, the little is the increase of the basic taxes mentioned.
"Bonus and littleus will depend on security and her profit.
If she had a good year of security, she would be able to increase the bonus," explains Noguera.
After exceeding the limit of twenty-five years, the drivers have easier when they are going to settle insurance, because the index of the risk of the client is reduced, thanks to the purchased experience.
In this context, it is most recommended to make survey against all risks with the light.
"Young people are usually unable to use the experiences obtained in the time when it comes to the havary and even in the management," assures the manager of the European Society in Spain and adds that the number of havarians occurs in the second year of the management when it has already been convinced by "the fear of a new one".
However, if the client is married, but she has no children yet, it is better to make sure of all risks if it allows its economic ability.
Children's families are assuredly considered as a customer with the lowest risk index and thus their advantages will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be to ensure all risks with a securities (which could be made 300 euros) or at a high bonus, the assurance extended to the other operators starts for a third year from the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is more calm and their companionship is higher, so they can allow them to get the highest slider," advises Luis Noguera.
The investigators are recommended to ensure the risks with a securities ( 150 euros) or the assurance extended to the final operators of the operation if a high bonus has been achieved.
It is important to say that the assurance of the car is not only because the protection of the drivers in the case of havary, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a fair deal with the adequate simplification of the possibilities of assurance, which would most likely give us due to our personality.
Celtic is trying to get on ́Milán point, which means osmifinal
Family and Celtic will focus on their powers on the San Siro station in trying to get a point that they miss to achieve their relevant targets at the end of the "Champions" law, because for Italy it would mean to be the first and in Scotland it would decide about the location.
The Italian have ten points and have already provided the process in the fifth stage of reduction in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but another is to make sure that Shachtior is not going to get six points to play with Benfika, who has four.
These two groups of D will be played a week before the sixth round ends, since Milan must play in the Intercontinental Hare in Japan, where the first triple of the threeth in the semifinale, in order to put the final of the sixth.
So this group will be closed before the final and undetermined outcome of Giuseppe Meazzy station seems to be the most probably, even though both men are trying to escape for winning because the Italians want to tactify on the home ground and Celtic knows that after the fire he would be the first and would make a better place in the osmifinal.
Gordon Strachana's husband could even make a loss even if Shachzhor doesn't win, but can't agree, because at the same number of nine points, Ukrainians who have spent a week in Glasgow (2:1) but have wined in the first direct run (2:0).
And thus players’ Milán will try to prevent Scotts evening, who will make sure they will get into the semifinal in the reorganized Champions League just as they have hurt them in the same way in the past competition with Kaka in the long term (1:0) after status 0:0 in the basic game time.
It is hoped that they win the "rossoneri" will be Shachtior, for which he has the price of the victory, only if Celtic had lost, both for the process of octofinal and for the EUFA.
Benffi, although it is the last and has no opportunity to continue in the highest European competition, it could achieve a third place by one victory, so it would play in EUFA.
The first concert in the tournee Spice Girls attended 20 000 people in Vancouver
The Group of Spice Girls started in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000 birds of her first tour since she fell in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place station in Vancouver, they declared that their new connection to their groups was "good".
Approximately 20,000 people have bought income to be present to a concert, which also included videos relating to the history of this group, which had been sentenced at the end of the ninety years.
The return and world tours will be played at the same time when the new album is issued in Spain, which provides the selection of their main successful tracks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Vodoo".
The five Spice Girls discovered on the wheel of a whistle that gave them the husband "Posh Spice", the British Balist David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the public that flipped GM Place, although Victoria's nervous appealed to him a few days ago.
Beckham, before the beginning of the presentation of Victoria Beckham, said to the British star, "He didn't see our bones, so I'm nervous about what he's thinking about the imagination."
"Sports Spice", whose department from the group in 1998 "for the disputes between us" caused for two years the release of the five-digital group, also showed its nervousness in meeting with journalists two hours before the beginning of the presentation.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world public change changed, the view of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I really decided," said Chisholm about the reconnection of a group that she left herself for nine years ago.
The song also noted that by time, "the people were equaled, and we all have the right thing."
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls came up together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to the CTV TV, the group arrived to Vancouver, the Virgin Airlines specialist.
At the time of the flight, the army was waiting for the airport.
Five have seven kids.
After a concert in Vancouver, a group will come out in California (USA), San José (4.eunce) and Los Angeles (5.a.7.).
It's going to be in Madrid, 23th.
Fears of new gas coverages between Russia and Ukraine
Rusland and Ukraine just spent the price of land gas and thus increased the risk that the Russian supply of this fuel can be affected in the West Europe.
The majority of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is conducted through Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is monitored.
Kyiv warned that, if Moscow will bring the price of gas to Ukraine, Russia will make higher transit payments.
Previous breakdown between these two last year has reduced the supplies to the EU States.
The latest dispute between Kyiv and Moscow comes in the moment when the Ukrainian government and the Russian owned gas monopol, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says that Ukraine will have to work more, because he agreed to pay up up to 50% more than the gas that is obtained from the neighborhood Turkmenistan.
Analytics say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas gas states during negotiation," said the Ukrainian Ministry of Anatolia China.
"The changes in gas prices should certainly be associated with our arguments relating to the higher transit payments (in Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The last contrast between Moscow and Kyev caused the reduction of the supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a sustainable fall of export to Western Europe, which increased the price.
Russian gas represents one quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas resources in the world, but a large part of them remains inadequately used.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Mediterranean Republics.
NHS " must control the employees"
The controller said that the Scotch community NHS must improve the control of criminal registers in non-European employees.
Recommendation from the President of Robert Black's highest control office has come after the workshop doctor in Scotland was linked to the red attacks on the Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black is also afraid that the Scotch NHS has no exact idea of the amount of an employee employee.
But his report highlighted that the final key controls had been correctly on the model of five health offices.
The President of the Supreme Control Agency was concerned without the June attacks on the Glasgow Airport on the staff obtained from the country outside the European Economic Area.
Eight-twenty-year Billal Abdullah, Iraq doctor in Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the aircraft after someone brought Jeep into the door of the main terminal.
It was one of the three doctors who were opened at the Mediterranean Court by the videomount accused of trying to bomb attack in Great Britain.
From the NHS comor, it is expected to check the employment staff on the basis of the exercise, experience and authorisation of work in Great Britain before his employment.
Although the Scotland Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland for the control of criminal registrations, this agency does not have the right to obtain such information outside the United Kingdom.
The report of the President of the Supreme Control Authority states, besides recommendations that the Commission should be allowed to take place by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employees with controls in some countries.
"Although we have proved that part of personal records contained evidence of these controls, they are not regularly conducted," reported the report.
Mr. Black said that the Scotch NHS agrees in many ways with its own policy of business checks, but added: "Our message warns the system to be improved in order to ensure accurate information on the amount of the staff."
President BMA Scotch Dr. Peter Terry said that it was "very impossible" that business controls would identify the potential NHS employees that could burn terrorist action in the future.
"The report points out that current business controls in Scotland NHS work well and that there is no more value that these will be brought on the side," he said.
The Scotch Health Authorities reported that it was currently 1 161 workshops of doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Control Authority warned that these numbers might also be higher because the Commission had a problem to identify the personal authorised to reside.
The investigation also proved that the control procedures set out in NHS authorities in the Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glassgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are increasingly performed.
They included the controls of pass, work authorisations and →.
The Scotch Government is currently transforming the policy and the employment control Directives for NHS occupational workshops.
Ministry of Health, Nicola Sturgeon, said, "I wanted to perform this job without the terrorist attack on the Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scotch government, in accordance with the health committees, considers the recommendations of this report and ensures that the best procedures appear in the updated pre-employment controls of all staff, including the employeees, which is planning to issue the next month.
Joy Division controlled film prices
Control, a life-descriptive film on Joy Division Ianu Curtis, collected five prices to British Inde and film Awards, mostly prices for the best movie.
The prices also obtained the star Sam Riley, who worked in the storage role of Curtise, register Anton Corbin and Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best herick of the Thriller of the Scanners on the scandal.
And the star of Daniel ́ig got Variety award because he got a British movie on the world scene.
The prices were celebrated in London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's road to praise with Joy Division until his self-mortality in 1980 in 23 years.
This black white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was only 3 million free.
But he obtained the Netherlands photograph of Corbino, before known thanks to the iconic album U2 Joshua Tree, two prices - for the best regime and for the best debuting register.
The Rock music was the advancement of another evaluated - because Julien Templa film on songs Joe Strummer received the price for the best document.
Viggo Mortensen received a plaque for the best herd for the role of the Russian Mafian Boss' leader in the Londry Thriller David Cronenberg's Presence.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation based on the roles of strong guys, gained the price of Richard Harris for an unusual contribution to the British movie.
This fifty-year, among whom the films belong, for example, Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming another part of Indiana Jonese - the Kingdom of the Christian Lebs.
Winstone said he was proud of this price, named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"The people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I had enough happiness to meet Richard Harris sometimes.
It's my man, a big hero of my time, I'm very honoured."
Independent film prices, known as Bify, are made by a portion in which filmers, hercers and festival organisations are sitting.
Middle stations and patterns of Bif belong to Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorism
The Saudi Arabia notified yesterday that it was arrested by 208 militaries for a membership in cells that were prepared without an attack on farmers, as well as the spirit and security folders.
The State TV of the largest exporter of the rope reported that one of the cells wanted to enter the rockets into the country.
Simpatizants al-Kaidy have led a campaign against monarchia, the United States associates, since 2003, then from invasion to Iraq.
The television reporter noted that the eight military cell conducted by foreigners planned an attack on appeal in the Ash-Sharqiyah province.
The Saudi Arabia has a powerful reaction unit of 35.000 members on the defence of equipment from an unexpected al-Kaida attack to the largest world companion for the processing of the rope in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report was sensitive to the internal declaration of the Ministry: 18 prisoners belonged to the cell conducted by the "expert for the fuel of the cancer" that was proclaimed into the country.
She further noticed that military people planned to pass in the Kingdom eight shots.
22 arrested were to prepare murders of spiritual and security works.
The Government asked the spirit of a more effort to protect Saudi to go to Iraq in order to join the Al-Qaida soldiers fighting the United Armies and the Swiss Government supported by the United States, which Sunniten Saudi consider as a Caesar.
Al-Kaida soldiers believed that the authorities bought many spirits in Saudi Arabia to support the king's family governing the government.
Militants - supported challenges by the leader of the Al-Kaidy Saudi Saudi Usami bin Ladina to focus on the West Saudi Government - were focused on aliens of resident complexes, government buildings and energy equipment.
"This war was a major effort for security forces in the past... five months," said the State TV of the internal speaker of the Ministry.
It was also arrested by 16 members of the "medical cell" in Media, which was intended to promote "takphiric thoughts" - the idea of Sunnith Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims designed as unbelieving and disfellowshipped.
Among the prisoners were 32 people accused of providing financial support to military people.
The climate on Venice is possible to see the future of the Earth
Scientists reported yesterday that Venus could ever be a pleasant place for life.
Data from the European station shows that the planet is still more like its main double earth than it was thought earlier.
Outside is the nearest planetary neighbor of the Earth.
These two worlds are the same large and running after similar loves, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that a billion years ago there were subminans similar to those on Earth and could also be residents.
But the clear-screen effect caused by carbon oxide, the atmosphere of solar radiation and the lower rate of turnover sent Venus after totally another way of development.
Today the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is too heavy at the tavens of the sea, and the rain of the storm and the power of the urican.
The findings from the Sodium of the European Space Agency Venus Express, who studied the planet one year, offer a close view of how the Earth could develop in case of disasterous climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Oxford University Physics Category and one of the leaders of the mission Venus Express said, "It is more clear why climate is different to Venus than on Earth, although the planets are differently similar.
"Our new data are allowed to set a scenario in which Venus started the same as the Earth, perhaps with a people's population, a billion years ago."
Police kept "the beloved uran"
Kilo of the radioactive material, evidently embraced urane, was arrested by the Slovenian and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police speaker said three people were arrested and the material was checked.
He didn't confirm that it was a famous uran, but he said that the substance could be sold for a million dollars (480 000 litres).
Continued doctrined
Mitt Romney said that for the president's candidates it wasn't worth answering the questions from the snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates immediately agreed with the YouTube debate in which the general electors replaced their questions on the video and transmitted them to the published candidates.
No of the issues sent in the middle of November 28 was as comic as a snowman who asked the democrats for global deployment in the debate on YouTube second side.
However, the questions and answers this time reflected many of the status of the Republican Party on elections in the next year.
It is not exactly like CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, to select clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time for the only subject, was focused on advancement.
This is one of the most powerful issues of the Republic.
CNN requested the panel of non-determined electors to turn back to the coach when they heard something comforting: the voter menal was agreed when the candidates spoke of a strong access to the chairs.
The strongest and largest exchange of views has occurred between Rudy Giulianim, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who was in front of key rapid votes in Iowa and New Hampshir.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to raise the story of a man who was as the recipient of New York, mixed on illegal accommodation.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former massachusetts State's ex-immigrants for his home.
These two reserved particularly when the wallets asked whether some candidates would support "amnestia" (in order to give illegal immigrants a normal position and a possibility of citizenship).
Further candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, congressman from Colorada, were able to reach their little in a moon on this subject.
No one of these two has a chance to nominate, but both remain in the game maybe they have started fighting for immigration before and more stronger than the end.
At least, the candidate has the same view: more attractiveness to the chairs, no tolerance for illegals.
This subject, together with both food games from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps the republicans to forget or minimise the dispute between freedom and Christian conservators.
But the debate started to be very inappropriate when it arrived on other subjects.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported the shooting weapons in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated tobacco technology should be considered as a torture.
One teacher asked whether to candidate to every Bible word.
Mr. Giuliani, by means of this, reached up to the view that, although the Bible is his favorite book, he just does not believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another teacher asked if Jesus would support the punishment of death.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all the conditions in the first place in the recent investigation in Job thanks to his Christian conservation - said that the punishment of death is inappropriate but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too wise to candidate to whom he had served as smiles.
The government remains unusually open.
The growth of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa is covered with recent success in receiving money and voiceful joy of Ron Paul at the central debat.
These two have turned away from the bottom, because both sides are still unable to agree on known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very quickly and convincedly with a winning report on the American Size on the lips, located on both sides.
This time the side is displaced and the result is far to the uniqueness.
Labourist diseases
Gordon Brown found a past to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it's a majority of British political scandals, this is not particularly piquanty.
It doesn't seem to be sold by the same rules, no properties in the Paris hotel were mysteryly paid, nor were any extra-married fingerprints charged.
But a barricad Gordon Brown would be surrounded without being revealed that a rich businessman has masked the contributions of the Governing Laboratory Side at 650,000 litres (1,3 million dollars) under the names of other people, and that the party has not announced.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister dismissed the elections and threatened British intellectuality by claiming that this decision had not been affected by the investigation, it had been able to ensure that the government would be able and effective.
Instead of formulating this with which the most amazing representative of the Liberal Democrats, the fearful Mr Brown has ever changed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unrepentant salvation of the Northern Rock bank has shown weaknesses in the management and challenging trial under the hand.
The badly thoughts on the change of tax law were connected by the firms against government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has discovered an unrepresentable administration of deficiency.
Three generals in the department restarted the rebellion in the dramatic Lords; they protested against armed expenditures, because they claimed that to be the captain of armed forces was a part of a contract.
Now there are many gifts from David Abraham; Peter Watt, the general secretary of the inner discipline (and their former guardian), has already resigned.
It doesn't mean that Mr. Brown would not turn back to his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the point of interruption that they are looking for for a difficult governance.
People don't believe politicians and don't have them, but they're going to take their uncertainty when we're taking a new party.
When it seems that any premium is probably increasingly no more, and it doesn't have to be in the office, this is the decline: the State administration becomes a dealer, the ministers start to make a breathing, the pressure is looking for bad news and the government becomes unconcentrated and defensive.
In one way, Mr Browna's position is particularly compatibil, because it cannot take place to other political leaders.
Anyway, he'd go away from Tony Blair, he was his first dealer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the financial authority are related to the decisions made by Mr Brown as a Minister for Finance.
And even though it was not directly involved in blairs, such as long investigation of the financing of political parties caused by "valuation for money", electors could quietly bear that it was.
However, Mr. Browna's hatred is not as bad as they look.
The crowds are not so furious as the conservators are doing.
As regards Mr. Bean, no one died or was lying.
And the treatment, whatever it can be painful, is to provide what the stalinistic trends of Mr. Browna promised: a relief, strong and easily brutal government.
The latest breaking around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says that he did not want any publicity for his goodness.
It could be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against anonymously large political donors are simple and exists: the public has the right to buy access to those governing countries.
Mr. Watt, who said he felt about the procedure of Mr. Abrahams, but he didn't know that he was illegal, he would certainly be earnestly heard; too, Jon Mendlesohn, the main-equipant of money, who had learned about the disgusting gifts in October.
But yet, Mr Brown is not a bit involved; there is nothing that would indicate that he had shared these fairs, even though the main part of the payment passed up after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half of the job.
He was very condemned by his own side by this violation of the laws, but he determined his determination by seating after a certificate instrument, the Commission for the investigation of this matter - will also lead to a bishop in the trial and the judge.
In this case, teachings are not suitable.
If the law was violated, it's the police matter.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, for example, to find a permanent president of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has no one for six months, and to replace the reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require those who are in difficulty to cooperate with the conservators and may also give their special financial relationship with the Committees - the bitter pills for the dedicated party, Mr Brown.
But he'd have to take some of the simple facts.
Conservatives now have a sound speed in the investigations; he has two years to get from the electoral box; and the only way to gain victory is an inappropriate integrity and higher competence.
Cards
It affects the crisis of subordinate hypothecs of the American credit card market?
When the blood is in the water, naturally, they will be resurrected to have a gross floor.
Now when the American market is increasing, the preachers have focused on the outer credit card market.
Goldman Sachs' analyses say that losses on credit cards, if the hypotech has been ordered by the subordinate, could achieve 99 billion dollars.
The pressure knowledge is clear.
Increasing number of cases of incapacity of payment (for more than 30 days late) and repealed characteristics (contingencies that the provider considers unemployable).
The HSBC bank notified last month that on the US market, 1,4 billion dollars had lost 1,4 billion dollars - too because of non-essential credit card payments.
But it's still soon on the panic.
It's still a little bit of the decreased and uncapable payment.
According to Moody's evaluation agency, 3,89% of the incapacity of payment was in the third quarter degree of the total percentage point under the meaning.
Increasing measures are partly explained by the technical deficiencies.
The change in the American personal bankroot laws of 2005 leads to a decrease in the number of reported bankroots that make a large amount of loss on credit cards; therefore, the reporting level (and the number of replies) would be deteriorated without prejudice to whether the general submissions for the expenses were deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good pair of payment, which shows the amount of the debtors of the monthly debt.
And confidence in valuable papers guaranteed credit cards is strong, even through the parallel in other structured financial angles.
Mr. Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup's research company suggests that their volumes in 2007 will be more than 25% of the inflation.
The right paths for the enlargement of infections between the crisis of subordinate hypoteches and the credit card market are determinedly: when the payment of the income in the insolvencies is deemed more debt to the credit cards.
However, credit credit cards providers are more than money rates than the values of the hands of the subjects, so the falling prices of homes do not need to mean a change in the confidentiality of the payers.
They may even be worth money providers.
The motivation of consumers to pay hypoteque is lost when the value of their owner is decreased under the value of the money; therefore, the debt on the cards is moved up to the list of priorities for payment.
Caret providers also can be more flexible and more flexible to react to more bovine submines than suppliers of hypoteque by changing the rate or limits of debt.
This should be theoretically decreasing the risk of the change of the prices of the main objects.
"It's not going to happen that ≥ one beautiful one just so all the payments have been reviewed," says Gary Perlin, the financial leader of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosion in the subordinate hypothec is low, the risk of progressive weakness is far more real.
The lower price of household and debt debt puts America into recess, the credit card sector will be before the darkest future.
Take care of the bastards.
British banks admitted the wine in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who had to be judged for their role in the subway associated with the former financial leadership of Enron Andrew Fastwow have changed the statement in the middle of the middle and admitted the wine.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were in the seven accusations of subcountry when they had to participate in financial subways in 2000 with Fastowe -- to enjoy their employees -- they had a copy.
They had to stand before the court in January.
However, during the judgment before the American Periodic Court of Justice, Ewing Verly Jr., everyone agreed to a single subcountry.
The case of these three former leaders of the Greenwich NatWest Company, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, figured on the front pages for two years that continued the exemption.
In the United States, their case is one of the uncluded parts of the investigation started after Enron in 2001.
The accusation against them in 2002 warned Mr. Fastowa that it was a goal of government investigation on the short of Enron.
The complaint against bankers -- who served the "NatWest Trinity" survival -- says they came to Houston in 2000 to establish the undertakings together with Fastway and his former main officer Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partnerships controlled by Fastwee, which was the text of many enronic underways that enroned after a spiral direction to report the bankroot.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank evaluated its share in this salary, but our three British Parties did that he had a significant value.
The company under Kopper's control bought a bank share in this stock for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper for the share of 250 000 dollars in this company.
According to Fastow's complaint, Enron claimed that the energy company would pay for its share in this company by Greenwich NatWest 20 million dollars.
In general, 20 million of them went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers received 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others improved $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted the wine in two cases of appeal for his role in Enron's destruction.
The British three were arrested in three months later.
Fastow is currently in the execution of six-year-old trial in the Federal Research in Louisiana.
Kopper is in the trial of three years and one month in the equipment in Texarkana.
All three Britannians moved to freedom to buy 1 billion dollars, which invited them to stay in the United States for the Court of Justice.
Enron, when the seventh largest company in the country, came to the bankrot in 2001 after the years of the ethnic tricks had no longer been able to hide the billion debts or to show a disadvantaged speculation as winners.
The refund was canceled by thousands of workplaces, more than 60 billion dollars of market value and more than 2 billion dollars in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and the former leader of Jeffrey Skilling were judged last year for their tasks in the fall of the company.
Skilling is in the execution of more than 40 years old.
The judgments of Lay for the injury, injury and other accusations were deleted after he died for heart disease last year.
Moscow Incapacity
The airport price of Gulfstream G550, equipped by Rolls-Royce engine, and with sufficient fuel volume for nonstop years from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at 54 million dollars.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is detailed to return.
"He can take to 18 travelers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one of them is interested in so many places because it's for a family or a fire president."
Mr. Firer was sitting in Gulfstream's town last fifth on the Millennium Exhibition, which is the four-day orgy of the consomm shown in the mother's exhibition center on the periferia of the main city.
Besides Gulfstream, they set their stations over 200 other luxury suppliers, who hoped that the rich Russian weddingly attacked everything from the mahagoned jachet after the diamants obtained by the cars for which they would not be disturbed nor 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked carefully on the oranch Porsche in the board.
"It's a beautiful car, but it's fifty and decades against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market of private airports."
On the waves of the rocks, they'll get money into the Russian main town as if they had Dallas' days.
"We have passed the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans were very rich and went to Europe, where they looked as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, listener of the fourth year in the Davis Centre of Russian and Euro-Asia studies in Harvard.
Similarly, as saudians in the 1970 ’ s and Japanese in the 1990 ’ s, Russians are the most prominent world losers.
The most exclusive luxury marks are looking for their part on this Klondike.
In the other place in Moscow, this week the Luxury Industrie of Donatel Versace, Toma Forda and Bernarda Arnault, President of the LVMH group, came to change ideas of how to sell dear goods on the markets, such as the Russian.
(Conferences are the International Herald Tribune, whose own company The New York Times Company.)
Russia, according to the list of the richest people of the magazine Forbes, has 53 billion dollars with a total name of 282 billion.
Moreover, the local main institution in the Center for Economic and Financial Research reported on the development of personal riches in the former Soviet Swazi, which provides in Russia 103,000 "three" millioners whose ownership is 670 billion dollars.
(The World Bank states that in 2005, 15,8 % of Russia lived under a minimum of existing.)
"In Moscow there are hundreds of millions -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, the sale and marketing representative of the Londres' curtain David Morris.
She was first on the field, together with the Russian distributor of this label, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are unusually adjusted and men are everyone for the whole time."
When they were spent in the dinner chat on Sunday Halls, Evgenia Yumatova, and about five years older Sweetlana Turovkova himself and their clients were marked as millions.
"I was looking at that car and I couldn't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who was in a label clothing as a veteran of red coppers, which looks like Joan Rivers as a home road.
Veletrh seemed to be focused mainly on red riches, markedly managed Russian purchases who are willing to sit for a few hours in the road operation so that they could go through the storage that Cedillacy Escalade cries, platin fisheries, Mövenpick, cowboard tables, apartments in Dubai, Gund floors and wooden.
The simple public members could buy income for EUR 30 (44.57).
"Russians are interested in what the label is the best and best," said Mr. Giirath, who patrioticly buyed the stand of the Netherlands porcelaneous manufacturer Royal Delft before the reproduction of the image from hand-made blue caillo in the survival size.
"Ok, of course, Russia's interested more nice."
In fact, the sellers now say that the Russians with old money (with the Russian measurement is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from black logs to a few known labels of limited editions that would never be shown on the purchasing campaign.
Even so many thousands of people, billioners, missionaries of millions, or simple tourists, every day they were driving the halls.
And some of them bought.
By the day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, local general manager of King Koil, was selling two married gardens from the wheat, the cashmire and the bathroom, prolifered by gold nets, after 70,000 dollars.
Similarly, Mikhail Lyubimov said, A1 Moto's sales manager, which makes a high-end car with high-end alarms that his company sold the Oranz Porsche for $170,000 to the Russian millioner.
On Wednesday, Andrej Karapetian, president of the company L.A. Connection, who wants to manage the luxe cars, sold three rails into the car in the area of connected railways for Rolls-Royce Phantomy after 55,000 dollars.
He showed the reporter about the car proposed for the Russian owner of the casino, which had the extract of the Svarov Crist that looked like a rulet.
Price: $22,000 for four.
"The Russian millioner, who wants a car from a pitch of wheat or a portrait of his wife from a kitchen-shirt, still doesn't need to drive on those wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll put them into his garage about 30 to 40 cars."
Although many Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millioner" doesn't mean anything too exhaustive, in view of a large increase in prices of the current potential.
"If you bought yourself three or four years ago in Moscow's apartment, you're probably already a millioner, at least on the paper if it's not ready," he said.
"There's more than you think."
Those who are not millioners could at least have been able to preserve wealth at the station of the Russian company Alliance Continental, which is involved in the management of actives.
The community has produced four red phone buildings of the British phone columns of false banks in the value of a million dollars.
After Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said that his team printed for Veletrh Millionariers 500 000 false banks.
Nevertheless, the students stopped to shoot around the hook of money, or to leave a friend photographing by the mobile phone, how he rests at the replacement riches, or simply shoot a couple of million caps.
"You know, everyone in Moscow can feel as a millioner," said Mr. Karryev.
It may cause a disappeared operation in New Jersey
It was a day before the Festival of Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the restaurant on something better and watched the health that came to the white new Ethiopian house at two houses after West Scott Avenue.
Soon the car was joined by the police guard.
And then another.
"So I saw the delivery of the court doctor," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant controller.
"In that moment, I felt that someone died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, an executive assistant of the New York Police Director.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a non-liquid plastic chirurgical procedure, whose identity police refused to provide that worked in the house number 212 at West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet discovered what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicological tests that have not yet been known for weeks will help to solve a mystery death that has sent the newary police a wall of disturbance.
After Arroy was a assistant of the police manager, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many of the division.
"He was loyal, anxious and strongly working," Mr. McCarthy said about Miss Arroy in the phone interview in the middle.
"He was my shot.
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy noted that Mrs. Arroy was a wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ancient newary policeman who works for the Commission for the control of alcoholic drinks, and that she leaves two sons behind him at 14 and 11 years of age and an unnecessary daughter.
Eileen Walsh, the speaker of the State representative of the Union, Theo J. Romankowa, said that the detectives are trying to check whether Arroy died for the success of unlimited surgery operations.
"It's one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"The investigation is still running."
The offices indicated that they arrived in the house in three hours after the afternoon 21.
November and found Mrs. Arroyo on the cover.
She was announced in the place for the dead.
More than a week later, the offices have still said a little about their investigation or their owner of the house that appears to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh didn't say if the offices heard Mrs. Castro.
Researchers are trying to determine whether the part of the house is used as a Orientation.
In the middle of Mrs. Castrové's house, with a devastated round carrier in the pre-ground and a dalmatin backward, no one answered
At the door that led to the store, he stole in a open garage the blue bar with the title "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is used as a replacement of the vanil in eating and cosmetics.
Two horse wheels on the one side were weakened on the other side.
Mr. McCarthy recognized that after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroy gave him an unvaluable help in trying an unconscious and cruel political culture of his new city.
"He said, 'On this or this you should take care of,' said he.
"He was here when I came, and she was here when I left.
It was crazy."
In fact, Fed reduces the rates, leads to the strengthening of the world bursts
The prices of action on both sides of Atlantic have noticed that on the market, the Federal Bank will try to calm the payment submissions by further reducing the rates were strengthened by enhancing the statements of the American Central Bank's premises.
In London, New York, and in Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in order after Ben Bernanke, President of the Feder, said that, in response to continuing pressure on financial markets, they must be "flexible and pragmatic factors".
In the light of the evidence of the efforts to calm the markets for the signs of credit fees, Mr. Kohn said that recent disturbations "partially have rejected some improvements in the functioning of markets to the end of September and October".
He further noted that if the increased instability remains, it will increase the possibility that financial submissions of household and fire continue to be worse.
Investors consider these statements as a signal that Fed is ready to add further fresh dose to the American markets, and may also be further reduced by rates to stabilize credit subminans.
These notes also helped to quiet Wall Street with other bad reports about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed recorded low numbers.
The results of the financial faith were supported by the notice of the investment bank Bear Stearns that it would decrease 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world work and strength, in decreasing the costs for the compensation of difficult losses caused by a result of subordinate funds for residence in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be canceled in London, where the bank works 1.500 people.
In New York, the industrial index Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2,55 percent, and closed at 13 289,40, while the more used index S&P 500 increased by 2,65 per cent.
The London Index FTSE 100 increased by 165,5 point, or 2,7 percent, and closed to 6,306,2, while the value of the British blue-chips increased more than 39 billion.
The German Index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
Before the time ago, credit insufficiency on the markets was shown in full strength after the European Central Bank's three-month money packages were paid by the European commercial banks by 4,7 %, which is most than April 2001.
The pressure on the Classic Bank to follow Fed and the ECB and to release the above-value markets in Londres has increased with the extent that the amounts of three months of the British interbanc interests "Libor" have increased after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to its maximum from the end of September - 6,59 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilematos here, one almost the same hard as the other.
Who's going to be the number of six on the bridge this weekend in Candy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And in the larger context of nothing less relevant than the first test against Mr. Lance, who's going to make this decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election committee, who is at the best time at this stage, has Peter Moores, the main trainer, and Michael Vâhan, Ithan, with a decision to help and because the chair of Hugh Morrise, the main English team manager, begins to fulfil the post of a national election, not necessarily.
Whoever is set on the sixth place on the wheel will be anxious, but life often is not fair and sport no longer.
It is not easy to find what one will get on the top of his profession, while someone else will never get through the lower level, sometimes because of the lack of happiness more than the ability.
Not only in the crisis is the choice adequate and requires a trial that finally must be entities.
Is the time to move Bopara up?
It's fair to Shah, if so?
At the same time, they could ask themselves in other instances, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both of the young leader workers with good education and assembly reviews, should be increased in the committee - the place is only for one.
Who's going to say what level is right for the crickets if he doesn't have a chance to slip or screw on the other one?
Naturally, it has numbers of great influence on decisions, but the same owner and opportunities.
In the team, a cricketer must at a right moment take a look at whether he should take a wicket, and a chairman of a regular chance at the starting positions, if he should sometimes make an idea as a single-day cricket.
Taking the selection view is more complicated.
For example, in the lowland, there were many better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems sure, even if Stephen Harmison was declared as a healthy and awarded as a developer.
Anderson took 32 weeks in the first class at 33 overviews to everyone.
Chris Tremlett took the same depth only 29, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hoped in the next.
If he's going to play on the stadium of Asgiriya Shah, or Bopara can only be a thing of view.
The choice may divorce or reach both carrier, or it must not have a big effect.
Four years ago on Mr. Lance played Gareth Batty in each test and in the first class gave good performances, five weeks and 40 transitions, but Paul Collingwood, who was at the same time fighting for his place, who finally became a stable test cricketier, which is more, even though in Australia had two times hundred points, may be undervalued.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vängan and Moores, after another discussion in the pressure on today's train, clearly at the stadium of Asirgiya, will follow their conservation and give Shah more experience before Bopar's youngness.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, he speaks his accurate and valuable test test changes to 88 points in Bombaji and 32 hundred in the first class to six Bopars, which is seven years older and has a good stand against the spins.
However, Shah made two changes in May against Caribbean in the Test on Lord's, his home chain in Middlesex, only ten transitions, and this, together with the immediate refusing electors, when Văchan wanted to replace him on another stock, his burning seemed to have taken something from the elan that was so evident in Bombai.
In contrast, the Esex University has joy de liver in the bones.
On the cricket's grid, it's nothing to treat it, and his behavior outside the wheel symbolizes a recently converted car with a fire on four rounds on the exhibitory days of the English team sponsor, Volkswagen.
He went out with easily hurt and clearly shock, but as the first thing, he broke out his Vodafone (obviously also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his partner, who recently looked for it to ask him, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is absolutely better in the field, its middle-a-smiley surroundings on the current games that seem to be able to make it, divorced and burned with self-conscience and handsome.
Choosing a right person is one thing, choosing the right time is different.
Maybe it's just the same choice art.
I personally claim that Bopara gets his chance now, but I don't want to say that Shah will highlight, if, as the cylon tea letters indicate, it will be he who will play next weekend.
Business carry out of the work - and fight against al-Kajda
The buses full of Iraqs from Syria began to come to Bagdad yesterday and have been able to flee with money or the time of the vision, and others who hoped that the city would return to the normal life.
Some even returned to fight with the armies who had removed them from their homes.
Mansuric bus travels were already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the Official Government Conference on this bus, full of actors from Syria and Jordan, who returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after that they killed many doctors in Bagdad," Sabah al-Kubaisi, Sunnith doctor.
"Today, I came back to what I saw in the TV and about what I read in news, about what happened in Bagdad and how safe it is now.
"They say that the Mahdi Army stopped killing people," he said, "which means the shit military military of the Musady al-Sadra, who has temporarily ordered his people to interrupt war.
Casim al-Atwani, an eighty-year-year-year-old shit artist of the major Sunnith Republic of America, returned with his two children, because he couldn't renew Syria's vision and because there he did not allow the Iraqians to work.
His shit neighbors in America called him with the support of the American armies that helped the local household to remove Al-Kaid from its positions on the west of the main city and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunnith and Shit, who from his house in Sleikh in the north Bagdad, has removed the granat attack after he invited his fellow believers to rise against Al-Kaida.
He came back to fight.
"I'm sure that a few friends called me and told me that he's divorced in Sleikh milicia against Al-Kajda and that he's supporting me and my boys.
That's why I came back today," said the twenty-year Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many talked about the attractiveness of silence in the main town after strengthening the American military presence and the growth of local "groups of reproached citizens" that were armed in hand on the side of the American armies protect their quarter.
But more about the fact that the constructions have been made to return around the vision and inhabitation of money in Damascus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqians have fallen in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, one-twenty-year father of three children, expressed the vote of the suspicion divided between the rebels that Núri al-Maliki, the chiet Prime Minister, requested the Syrian government to reduce the limitation of the visibility of the rebels and thus contributed to the return.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people have passed before Iraqian sectoral murders.
"All was fine before Al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed the government to stop giving the Iraqians a vision to have to go to Iraq," said the Sunnith leader.
"I can't believe the government that supports criminals who burned me after my home."
The partial debt for weak violence is the fact that sunnity was extracted from shinits and in contrast, which decreases the stress in many places.
The fears are shown that the emergency of the sectoral pressure is again reflecting and leading to another fight.
Small Saars, good education
The smallest country of Germany plays a leading role in professional education, highlights even the international attitude of its high schools.
Only in one educational area, Saarland is concerned about the same deficiency as the rest of Germany.
"A man who doesn't come from Sarska, I explained that we're not a French, yesterday -- this self-ironic password appears in Sargy at the 50th year of birth of this smaller generation country.
Instead, France and Luxembourg play a great role in the Sargy Education System, which is monitoring the Education of the Coloin Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools are so traditionally working with surrounding countries.
The University in Saarbrücken was based on France in 1948.
Even today, students can finish the study with a double or even three-drop diploma.
Therefore, the higher part of the students, which is 15,6 %, corresponds closely.
Because the excessive number of Sarai children is to accept a high school - many of them, even without a gymnasium study.
"In Sarska, a professional educational system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, IW educational expert.
More than every fifth young person gets the authorisation for study on professional effects, Saarland is more than 7% over German media.
In comparison with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sarvia to combine practical and academic education.
The options to study two around are, in view of the start of the second person, the best in all Germany.
In practical oriented education and a delaying request, the number of solvents of engineering in the past years has fallen.
Therefore, the Sargy Ministry of School now has ordered high schools to create a promotion campaign for engineering.
"With Pisa's first study, we have conducted a few refores at the general educational schools," says the speaker of the School Ministry.
Therefore, the government has conducted comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order to begin to do what is first, the last year of the mother school is free - model that also collects other sex countries.
If the results of the throat are significantly improved, they will show the future comparative studies.
When Pisa studied in 2003, the share of risk gains was decreased from 29 to 20 %.
However, Sarah has not improved as much as other families.
The bathrooms can count better.
And to discourage the Saars study Pisa is inequality of the knowledge of foreign languages - in other cases, Sarska could just be quoted in this area.
The language of the neighbors is to be binding in gimnasia - even though the people of Sarska are not the French.
Heaven moves hours
What they don't see will go in Venezuela otherwise than in the rest of the world.
9. The President Hugo Chavez allows you to move hours in this South America for a half hours of the hour.
In Spain, there is a funny figure between the Chavez.
The Official Journal of Veniceuela reported that the hours, according to the new law, will be moved to at least four and half hours.
The South America state will be this step in the time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, has dealt with his decisions, otherwise, by providing the United States to the world the whole hour of time division.
In the middle of the local time, Chavez also announced that because of the box with the hands, he interruptes relations with the neighborhood Columbia.
This Levite nationalist declared that until the President Alvaro Uribe will be preserved by the President of Colombia, it will not be held with him nor with the Colombian government.
"I can't, because of my self-respect," said Chavez, who promotes the reform of the establishment, which the citizens of this land must vote in the Sunday reference.
This reform would strengthen his power in the country.
The Uribe's decision was devoted to reject Chavez's approval to negotiate in Couria with Marxist Republics on the release of hands.
The Uri's decision by Venezuela "fly in his face" criticized on Monday of Uribe Chavez.
Also in Spain, everyone talks about Chavez.
The new mobile call here was called "Why no these calls" (Why are you not quiet anymore?) - so it sounds that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
The Spanish King Juan Carlos expressed her, who, on the recent Iberoamerican top summit, the voice notes of this Left Populist were so deceived that he was so deceived.
Germans threaten lower payments in 2007
According to the prognoses, German employees are threatened for years to decrease real wheat even through a strong conjuncture.
Experts have rejected their pessimistic predict.
According to the estimates of Hanse Böckler, employees can actually calculate in 2007 by getting lower flight than in the latest year.
"Win has a small increase in payments, increased tax from additional values and increased prices in food and energy," said the Journal of Bild Gustav Horn from the IMK research institution (Institut for macroeconomy and Conjunkturforschung).
The new pressure on employees may also be expected in an unemployment assurance.
The Minister for Financing Peer Steinbrück, new newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung, said that the planned reduction of contributions to unemployment to 3,3 % is correct and reasonable for the new year.
However, the Social Agency should not again fall into the disturbance that she should ask for payments or contributions from the youth, feeling that this social democracy policy is the newspaper.
It was reported that the price exposure of food and sugar products had caused inflation to its highest state in the last thirty years.
In the annual comparison, the price was totally three per cent.
Outside is a big dual Earth
Through its life, the enemy atmosphere of Venus Earth is more like that it was supposed to be. The European Cosmic Sond Venus Express on Venus mentioned the events that also appear in the winter on the earth: the bleeding in the atmosphere and the aggregate faith in the field.
Almost three decades ago, the guy thinks he's blue on Venus.
The current European Sond Venus Express has made evidence - captured electromagnetic wings in the area of the atmosphere. On Venus, they fly from darkness to darkness in about 56 km, wrote in the deep magazine Nature Christopher Russell from the California University in Los Angeles.
According to a known theory of the original mass on Earth, the blues could produce life. Bourers were evidently called in the ocean reactions leading to the exhibition of amino acid, the basic stones of life.
"If there was sometimes life there, it must have been a long time," explains Sean Solomon from Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today there would be something alive on the surface of Venus. Atmosphere is about 100 times worse than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"It's only a potential bird of the Earth, but it's two," said Russell.
Why Venusha, which is so similar to the earth, has started to develop completely differently, is the basic question of the mission of Esa.
Since the beginning of the 1990s no investigation was sent exclusively after Venus study, the start of Venus Express sondy was in the research of this planet as a milk.
According to the latest results of research that approached several of the articles of the Nature magazine, Venush’s uniqueness in the Sunday system was not only highlighted.
"They also showed that our neighborhood planet is more like the earth than it was supposed to be," said Esa.
Besides the already known crowds in the north field, the people found a dark faith in the southern field, which is essentially attracted.
This phenomenon takes air streams on the north side, writes a research team under Guiseppe Piιοoni from the Italian Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second internal planet of our sun systems is the same weight as the Earth, and with an average of 12 100 km is almost the same.
This planet named Jitrenka or Event will run the sun in 225 days.
However, around his own axes are very smaller. One day on Venus, 243 days on Earth.
Although Venezuela does not accept the surface temperature by 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars of the Earth, both planets have come out of very similar subminans.
The water was replaced on both sides, but it remained in the oceans, while she went out from Venezuela into the universe.
While the carbon oxide on Earth is connected in carbonates, the Venezuela is the atmosphere of the atmosphere.
Köhler takes Markel's meeting with a department
The Social President Köhler requires the end of parties' disputes for the adoption of divisions in the Office.
The SPD immediately criticized its attacks on the office after the meeting in September.
Social President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's story and calls a big coalition to finish the ship around the receipt of the dalayalams.
"They shouldn't be presented as a nation who is not in this question unique," Köhler said to the economic journal of Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed understanding for the decision of the German officer Angely Merkel (CDU) to take the further in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, the human rights have a universal validity for me," Köhler said.
Although the Social President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in the policy, he did not prevent Markel to stop when it was estimated that he would create a new policy against China.
"The local officer did not leave from the traditional political of China.
China also knows it," Köhler said.
The Minister for the Ministry of Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) directly showed his independence with the adoption of a dalayalam, and it was attacked by a number of coalices.
Steinmeier tried outside the "precedent" coal policy.
After the adoption of the Dalayalams in the Office of the Office, German-Chinese relations have been harmful.
Not only the Chinese Government rejected the invitation of the German Ministry of Financing Peera Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the SPIEGEL journal, the strategic dialogue of the Ministry also has been distorted by both countries.
The Chinese president of the Government Wen Jiabao called the officer of Angela Merkel to recognize that the acceptance of the deals was a mistake.
China does not admit when European policies officially accept Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao highlighted China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalailam showed that Tibet and other Tibetan vessels, which also are confidential in the country of China, are trying to separate from China.
Sheuble warns against similar disasters that have gone out in France
Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar disasters that have gone out in France.
We have to do everything so that social insatisfactory in Germany does not increase violence in the street, calling the social ministro inside.
Barikades burned, the guardians shot the police brooks. After serious young people's concerns in France, the Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is a similar development in Germany.
"We need to take care of that too so that we do not create such social stress that will rise to violence.
We have to breathe it seriously," said in the Hunvery newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young man is able to compare the change of community.
The social government, the country and the foreign already work for the elimination of problems, said Sheuble.
What doesn't mean only integration of migrants.
"On the summary of integration after Islam, we're mentioning first success."
However, the view is still in place.
Sheuble showed at the same time that the planning and social problems of German objects are not comparable to those French.
In the past nights, youngness with police in the north areas of Paris was a strong street fight.
Even in Toulouse, she burned cars and public buildings.
The major integration efforts of the German government requested the President of the Turkish foreign in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
As regards the disaster in France, Colat warned against the "simulation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Yet, it should be done.
Colat showed that among people under 25 years who enter from the family of migrants, the unemployment measure is "increasingly high".
Moreover, it is necessary to ensure more than a number of studies.
Colat said, "We have to give the youth to the youth."
The President of the Turkish community, however, added that in Germany there is a higher social control of the family in France.
Moreover, many youths in the family of migrants do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
He asked, "It's first, but we need to take care of."
We have to allow young people to start working and training.
Meanwhile, she stayed at the Paris vessel Villiers-le-Bel very quiet.
There were hundreds of police officers in the ship, and over the rubbers passed the light.
The authorised authorities reported three prisons and a number of covered waste and cars.
From yesterday, there are about 1,000 fixed order forces.
Police will include as necessary, and she will notify after visiting the Ministry of Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In disasters in Villiers-le-Bel, some 80 police were hurt at night on the attack.
Next night, Toulouse's concerns were taken.
She called a Sunday transport accident in which two youths came to life.
According to the first discovery of the State Representative, the police will not bring any wine on the death of young people.
In the River of Angely "Oblacks"
The Office actually remote outcome shows that the coalic is programming at the end and that we can't even expect anything more from it.
In what country does this office actually live?
After its unfortunate, mildly disappointed and poor debates on social snow, we have to find: not here - not in this country that it should finally be governed.
In view that it is too focused on the policy, Angela Merkel answered a lot of arrogant.
That's the province, she said who showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Spolk's snow, she appeared to see how much it deserves.
Markel wasn't feeling a real interest, so the feeling of problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblaková" was presented: a political policy that results from the finals that run into the foreign policy, and there is just a mill.
For example, climate protection: without stop, it is praised for the conclusions resulting from the summit in Saint-Anddam, but it does not say anymore how the climate objectives are achieved in Germany.
And, at all, such a self - so much uncleanness would have forgived the president of the CDU two years ago.
Now it's limited to a plane of phrases that could increase the spouse between people.
This approach harms its pragmatic imid, which doesn't deceive because the problems are resolved.
But in the race of Angely "Oblaks" are the internal political problems of the environmental matter.
Child poverty and care of people with low wounds?
There's been a couple of more closer to these subjects.
Notice how often Merkel's when relating to children's addictions is rejected.
Merkel must start three times from the beginning so that it may be able to express at least partly correctly.
When things start to be too specific, it's broken as in a totally alien teren.
Department of Attraction
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates at Youtube has been discussed in a debat - and both of them must now be afraid of the outside candidate.
It has already been shown to both candidates.
Mitt Romney preachs his companion Rudy Guiliani that from New York he has made a "profession for illegal accommodation".
Giuliani Âe replies to the easily recipients: "I think that his own house was just one such appeal," he replies and predicts the former Massachusetts that he personally employed immigrants without documents.
The candidate is given to an attack, because the Republican Foundation has no favorite yet, eight presidential candidates use these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their subsidiaries.
Half-minute, Internet engineers and via Youtube videos only serve as such a key topic.
"We have enabled Hitler to get power," advises John McCain to his cousin to Ron Paul, who is the only one who makes an immediate station of armies from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain doesn't strike out with his discounts or Romeney, because he refuses to judge the torture method called "Waterboarding", in which it is simulated tobacco.
The reactions of the public in St. Petersburg show that the important subject of the campaign is not a war in Iraq, nor a torture method.
The community shall take place in the hall whereever the preservation of values is highlighted and the future increase of taxes has been rejected.
So he's going to show where the weakness of both favorites are.
"I was missing this time," explains Romney's broadcast and asks a page-based and TV public for forgiveness for being still a driving-up in 1994.
Giuliani is in disappointment when it is to make a literal Bible study.
Musharaf the first government in civil
The day after his exit from the position of the Supreme Commander of Armageddon, the Pakistanian governor Musharaf made the President's swear.
This ends eight years of military government in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Parviz Musharaf, made the President a vow on Thursday, and thus continued in the Presidency Board for the next five years.
The Pakistanian TV transferred a live ceremonie, which was held in the presidential palace in the main city of Islamabad.
Musharaf swore that he would honor the establishment and strive for the good people.
In the middle of his office of the Supreme Commander of Armageddon, Ashfaq delivered his truster to Kiyani, who was under international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he got power in an unclean military crowd, the former general rules first as a civil head of the State.
By declining from the position of the top captain of armed forces, Musharaf fulfilled one of the main opposition and the West requirements.
Another central request is a cancellation of the exceptional status which Musharaf reported on November 3.
According to Malika Muhammad Qayyum, the Supreme State Representative will cancel the exceptional status of Musharaf soon after his promise, and thus will comply with the requests of the West.
The highest Court of the country, which Musharaf, after announcement of an exceptional status at the beginning of November, had sentenced to his lodged lawyers, refused the next week to reject all reports on the successful recurrence of head of the State of 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the attack of the military conveyment in North Vaziristan, and four other were hurt.
The speaking army indicated that the bomb exploded on the street near the border with Afghanistan.
The father's crawl is back
The glorious German group of seventy years plays again. Three members of the Harmonia group rebuild their electronic syntheses at the concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live in 1974, a sister from the most successful period of the cappella.
They've been more known in the box this time.
The reported sensation then consists of the exhibition of three resident gentlemen, who first look like they're just kissing dinners.
Everyone has a box, cabs, and mainly buttons.
The 30-year-old Dieter Moebius is sitting at the snow.
On his left, Michael Rother's seventeen years old, who has a laptop and a kytar before him.
Threety-seventy-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, which is focused on synthesizers, is from the view of the wheels right.
Everyone adds sounds, sometimes even beat.
Sometimes, of course not, a traditional track will occur.
It doesn't seem to be too bad to the masters.
Among the lovers of the crawl, he called a revision of the Harmonia capelle.
One thing is here, and the repeated questions showed that this name is part of the collective report on the pop, but it is not so quiet that someone can painfully hurt this chapter for twenty-three years.
But why could Germany not celebrate his live legends of the seventy years?
And especially when you're a musical, falsely called crautrock, in England and in America, it's higher than in your own country.
In 2003, when the musical business was assigned to the remaining members of the Country Group of Can Echo price for lifework, the salon was full of the tazing views of the German pops of fans.
Moreover, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked for their manifestation of the groups of La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the widow of the whiskys had no longer known the border.
Michael Rother starts on the Concerts of Red Hot Chili Peppers with them as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance home and love in the foreign is one thing.
With the Harmonia capelle, we are increasingly disturbing memory, this three was only two years and no longer had the effect that others had given to them.
Moebius and Roedelius already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under a promised name Cluster.
Beginning they played in the Berlin Division of Shaubün.
Then in Düsseldorf, from the economic divisions of the grammophone company leading to the church.
Rother shortly helped the powerwork group, however, the story had reached as a cytarist at the Neu! cappella, which may have been the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, Rother followed musical capely Cluster to the exil in Forstu in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, the destruction of the 16th century, lived as members of the community that went out of the city.
They didn't live here so ideologically as in the commune I, where Roedelius had to be shoot as a boss.
It was more life in such a spitzway artistic apartment.
The name for this art is particularly removed from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein fishing assembly, whose mark was dataly found in the farm.
A lot of that Harmonia kept.
The first album was called "Hudba from Harmonie" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so quiet and humble, the capel suffered by financial movements.
The collection of rose has not served only self-appreciation.
Now issued CD "Live 1974" was held at a concert in Griesse before a recorded little, a 50-year-old cow.
Rother said that he wanted the members of Harmonie to be exhausted and eventually hungry.
For Roedlia and Moebia, that was a completely unrepentant request.
In 1975, the capel announced its outcome.
Rother ended in the isoteric sfera and his future was made with the "Heart's burning" album.
Capel Cluster lived again in the eighty years, and since that time, it's more successful than Harmonia was.
For the live album from Grissemer, we can be thankful for Herbert Grönemeyer.
His repository company Greenland took for the purpose of carutrock to be observed as a puppy German contribution to life music.
Capela Neu! was considered Rodelelio's only work at that time.
The body resurrection of Harmonie will run in the World Cultural House of Berlin.
The outcome of Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
It will be Brit, Julian Cope, the old pancaker and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler".
It also participates in Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
This is what we planned to have a total width of the impact of the craft on the future pop music.
The empty place of the glorious group will just fill the Harmonia.
Witness Brian Ena received by the most wonderful sounds in the salon, "The only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are images on which the Harmonia producer is in the agricultural seat.
It also contributes to the creation of legends to providing other black white photographs on which now are the divocted cabs.
Before they were three veterinarians again improvization.
I'm not going to be nice to microphones on the varhans and bubbles, so that they're going out of the tools that never heard self-produced tons.
Today, the electronic music looks like a electronic music.
Three in the technology of the puzzle.
It does not change anywhere, nor the congregation of the World Culture House.
Under the lead of Barbara Morgenstern's sound darkness, and in one beautiful place, emfatics are sing "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
Krautrock was a very ecological idea.
I never cared about the rock.
The roots are more than in blues found in musical high schools (Can), in ©s (Kraftwerk) or in refuge from artical and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever says "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia doesn't want to get out of peace now.
Even the most obvious thing is thinking exactly on the scene.
Where's the music starting, and when does it end?
This human question will be prepared for nerves or will make it possible for him to live in a lowly time of happiness.
Richard Gere isn't just too cynical
The Hunting Party and the Morderischer Peace immediately opened two films on the Balkan war.
But no one of them is convinced.
The film's suggestion is too big attitude to the activity and shooting, or they're too funny.
That's not the Hunting Party, nor the hero like Richard Gere.
Good news as the first: War crimes Karadit and Youth are still hidden in the Balkan Mountains, but just there, in the deep ground of the Bosen War, heir Richard Gere will be able.
At the last time, we lost this beautifulest man of the eighty years of age, not only because he played in many pleasant, unsearchable roles in women films, but in connection with his printing ́ems on the subject of buddhism, a man will take a pleasure to another film with this herd.
Yet, Richard Gere is once the strongest argument for the Hunting Party - Where is the lobster becomes a profit (Why must the names of films be so long and increased today?).
Gere gives a busy performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is in principle who Gere could happen if the judgment and movies were not so merciful: a man who has his best years ago, but like a memorandum still keeps a certain careful result.
But despite this trumf, the Hunting Party is together with the German movie Mörderischer peace, which also comes into the cine this week, just by continuing a number of unfortunate films on the Balkan war.
With the movie of Morderischer Peace, we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save Serbian girl from the Kosovo shooter, as one of them loves her.
Although it is grateful that the Serbians are not present here as the cause of all evil, this TV movie is changed too soon in shooting and action.
The movie will remain a lot of similar series of Cobro 11, even without a distance, but for the war.
The Hunting Party's movie can be expressed at the point why the Balkan War hasn't yet been able to broke a good movie.
Three American war journalists who are dealing with a "folk", a Serbian surrounding crime, may be a new "Apocalypse" at the other time and under the leading of another register and scenaries (herein's the murder of Richard Shepard) could be a new "Apocalypsy".
Because both stories are surprisingly like that small groups go into the forest to make something that is not able to army, but their ways will become a way to foolishness.
One of the failures of the Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the animal and emotional cycle represented at the beginning.
Instead, his proposal is also a romantic affair with the murdered Boss Muslim.
The Hunting Party can finally be described after the reporters in the last five minutes of the film will say what happens to the NATO, → and all the criminals of the world in the past five years did not say: to catch the crime and leave him the righteous destruction of the Boss Muslims.
It's so contrary to the logic of the film creation that it's going to turn to the International Court in Haag.
Then this film has a deep human message.
It rejects that Karaovat and Mladić are still in freedom, and the Americans and France (they are particularly unique) that, on the basis of secret political agreements, the investigation is not adequately intense.
But the good and evil are sometimes so similar, that the woman will attack us the fear of Brecht.
It refers to the tree mask of the Asian demon on the workshop of the writer: "I feel compassionately looking at the beachers living on the head, noted: how bad it is to be."
In films such as The Hunting Party, they appear exactly like the increasing heads that indicate how helpful it is to be good.
This problem is not limited only to the theme of war on Balkan.
Recently, these news recorded that all Hollywood films about Iraq were a big failure.
To this, only one can be added: No good film on South Africa has ever been listed.
As long as it applies: When the stars fall on the crisis or pass through the mine field, it will produce a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the limit of crime with Angelina Jolie or Blood Diamanten with DiCapri.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close.
Finally, they had to run ten years before Hollywood could take a good movie about Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films have to be watched - films that today are considered as classical Vietnamese works - "Lovec jelens", "Apocalyps" or "Followed News" - were not celebrated in any case as mysterious works.
But maybe today, when every mass murder is opened on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Then, the scenarios do not have the ability that is needed for an unfailing report of good stories.
"By or not" or "Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how the Nazi regime was actually governed in a terrible way.
Maybe man shouldn't want to be good if he wants to do good movies.
Maybe he's got to create a sarcast-declined artificial view as Romano Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned on the parallel between his his historical Romanian "Limprier's dictionary" and "Balkan war", he said, "The period is only in that some things never change.
Great people will be very dangerous, people will be killed in a terrible way, and there will also be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust closes the criticism for the refreshment of olympias
The decline of anxiety from the management of the Year Olympics in Hamburg has reached a critical criticism of the policy and economic.
Many people want to continue to fight for the heavy heating in the water.
But Von Beust is trying to make reality in the shopping of the chance.
Clause of the business company in Hamburk, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, in the middle of this decision, "with regard to the business as awesome".
No other project lastly tried a great motivation in the city as a olympian thought.
"Unless this goal, this sports political supervision would not be possible to maintain in such a high way."
Schmidt-Trenz invited the Senate to not bury this project, but created a new concept, "which comes from a changed time plan."
Ancient Ole von Beust remained in the middle of his previous responsibilities, which indicate that the olympical ambition of Hamburk at least 2028 is unrealistic.
"No Hamburk, but the German Olympian sport's association will decide about the olympical candidate," won Beust said by the WE ONLINE newspaper.
He showed that at the beginning of Sporto’s association will decide on Mnichov candidate for winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 time plan."
Yet, this dream hasn't ended yet, says von Beust.
Hamburian sports’ union (HSB) indicated von Beusto’s statements for the political.
I think Hamburk doesn't want to take care of the Olympics in the next 20 five years.
"It's still too soon to destroy the chances by marking the plans already in this early phase as buried," said President HSB, Günter Ploss in the middle.
It would be in contrast with the responsibility of the head of the senate, which he carried on the Valley Room of the Universal German High School Sports.
Von Beust here has not announced the candidate to Hamburk at University in 2015 as a refund for the order of Olympics.
The high school sport of Hamburk's association just nominated the next week to the candidate city.
The SPD Fraction in the Hambury Parliament of the Senate stated that it was a very valuable time that could be used for the exhibition of residences in Hamburg.
"Woe Klein Grasbrook has been broken in the Senate for years because he has set up the olympy order and the building of the apartment," SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quist said.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook still planned olympiade with that the whole will be used to residents, the CDU solely set up on the "olympian factor".
Recording on the 2012 Year Olympics games has been called for his time in Hamburg a big surprise.
Hamburk's gone to Lipski.
It's not Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the expressions of Sweden and wood beds, doesn't think about Andy Warhol, but about Ikeu.
Or yes?
Tree beds currently produced in Sweden are on the list of Warhol's works of dark shadow.
Most of his in the list of ninety-four "Brillo boxes" type Stockholm are falsified.
After what the Swedish news "Expressen" has expressed doubts about the right of Warhol "Brillo Boxs" in 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet Museet Museet in Stockholm with an exhibition that brought discovery; six "Brillo boxes", which in 1995 the Moderna Museet renewed by his former manager Pontus Hultén, are copies - as the extent of the other "Brillo boxes" type Stockholm, which are on the international artistic market.
The preaching events are a famous, mature, artificial and currency cycle.
Warhol produced his first Brillo box in New York in 1964, painted the wood beds based on the red-modrolled design of paper boxes of the brillo woods.
His presentation in Moderna Museet in 1968 preached - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo's beaches from the carton. They did not enter (from the financial debt) from Warhol, but were directly added from Brillo company.
It wasn't about artificial works, but about their proposals, just exhibitions.
Warhol, obviously, also allowed in 1968 to produce a few wooden Brillos in Sweden, but they are not built in the Modern Museet.
The more recent witnesses now talk about 15 beds that rightly entered the artic and architectural history as authorised originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were charged for more than $100,000.
The problem now consists of the legendary manager of Pontus Hultén Museum falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made in Sweden and built about a hundred beden, then Warhol left him.
In the ability, 105 Hultén Beden were made in Malmoa for the exhibition in Petrohrad just in 1990.
Warhol was three years after death.
Lars Byström, the top conservator Moderna Museet, examined outside the six Brillo boxes that are in the property of the museum, including three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private assembly, from which two were prepared in Sweden in 1968, and after their cross-border boards were cut down with base color and rounded, they were cut down with oil white.
In contrast, the copy structure of 1990 showed that the color had been nased without the previous basic shape directly on the overscreen board - besides the acryl and not the oil colour.
"This bed was not authorised by the artist and should be removed from Warhola official list Brillo boxes," the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve said: "If the organization of Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York doesn't come to other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six of its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copy".
In July, the Authentication Board has announced that these "switching accusations", which were brought up in the case of a box with a middle work, would be interested.
But the organization still keeps in an unforeseen silence.
Revolving soldiers in Manile is released
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers, who were again at a hotel in Manile, and requested the president Glorie Macapagal Arroy.
Antonio Trillanes, managing and corruption of the president at elections, reporters in the hotel said that he refused the responsibility for blood-proliferation.
The soldiers of the government have previously attacked with the composition of the airport to the hotel.
A few hours ago, two decades of soldiers were ope in the building.
On Thursday, there was about half of them before the court for a deceased trial to return in 2003, including Trillanes.
