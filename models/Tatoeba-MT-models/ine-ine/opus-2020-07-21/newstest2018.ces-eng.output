Movement for Civil Rights has issued a way of warning for Missouri
The National Association for Evaluation of Colour People (NAACP) has published a warning for color people traveling to Missouri on the basis of discrimination principles of the State and racial attacks.
“This is the recommendation of the NAACP for the State of Missouri from 28 August 2017, which calls for African travellers, visits and people of Missouri to increase the attention of a series of racial reasonable incidents that are currently in the entire State, in the state’s state’s statement.
The NAACP concluded that this step has been added on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which facilitate the extent of racismly motivated action before the court, as the result of the negotiation of organs acting in a criminal proceeding, which are unrelatedly targeted to minorities.
“The violation of citizens' rights.
People are stopped by police officers only because of the color of their floor, they are attacked or killed," said the NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel for Kansas City Star.
"The greatest amount of silence is too deceived."
It's the first warning of its type, which the organization issued to the United States.
Among the incidents that organized, racially motivated advantages were regarded to the students of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, the men of the black floor from Tennessee.
Sanders died in troubled circumstances at the beginning of the year after his traveling through the state came to the benzine, and the police took her into a liaison without accusation of destruction.
The road of the recommendation also warns the recent statement of the State's highest State representative of Missouri, which states that the black bottle drivers have 75% higher chance to stop the police.
"The aim of the road recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and partners before what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"The people must be prepared - they should carry money with themselves to the case of the cow or warn their family that they want to travel by the State."
According to the current numbers of the FBI programme to report hatred actions in Missouri in 2015, a hundred cases of hatred behavior occurred in Missouri, which results in the sixteenth place between all States.
The way of warning is too response to the new law of Missouri, which facilitates the distortion of discrimination under the provision of housing or employment.
The American Union for Civil Freedom (ACLU) issued the road for Texas and Ar’nu after the States approved immigration law, which allows States to keep people on the basis of the violation of this law, which, according to LU, is to improve the racial profilation.
The Road of Recommendation is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but at the last time, the lawyer groups have led to these measures in response to specific laws and trends in the United States.
The model was killed by the boss.
Her family hasn't been calm after 12 years!
Sally Anne Bowman model is killed.
In 2005, a girl from Croydon was killed by the leader Mark Dix, directly in the restaurant in which she worked, and she had been killed.
The victim of the murderers together should have sex and smoke the marihuan after he killed her.
Then he was sitting in a near-term coffee and watching the careful crime work to search for the workplace.
Dixie, the former leader, was sentenced in 2008 to take freedom for 34 years for murder and violation of Sally model.
The judge admitted only the attack of the youth, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a dead girl to lie on the street.
After three years, the police witnessed him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her former friend Lewis Sprotson had a trial night.
Wrah said, "He was seriously hurt, and after his attack the girl began to cry."
"He even attached attention and taxickers," he lied.
The girl, according to his responsibilities, had to protect what she could, but it was bad.
Lewis had to put her in the street.
Dixie's version was shown as a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he spoke about her endurance and kissing a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied, and he had to get marihuan.
Before the incident, Sally was with his former girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, he said to the police himself, Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started crying for help, so he attacked her back and put her hand through her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family takes the other attacks from the vandals to destroy her grave.
He's been hurt four times last half year.
There are such a crushed people who bury these graves.
"So our daughter is not there anymore," the Mirror's mother caused Linda's deceased girl information about the disappearance of the urna with the pool.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they had to attack when she went out of the garden.
The design vibrators are also decades of thousands.
"Cheises are not adequate or conserve," says Martin Raj, which operates a busy intimity boat.
In it you'll find design and luxe erotic helps.
In fact, those from the Czech designer Anny Mares.
It's started unfortunately, a bullet twelve years ago.
Martin Raj and his friends went to the cycloplane after Moravia.
One of them has not only brought a round, but also the boxes are filled with unusually looking vibrators.
"That's different boxes and delfines, and all it was green and yellow and just different," they tell me about eating.
His friend decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of the designed erotic aid of Fun Factory, which Martina had experienced, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion went to make other professions, he replaced him.
Today, it operates in the Prague Benedict Street butic Intimity, where it sells erotic help in a way that usually offers luxe cabs or boots.
Why not?
It is also the design subject.
Wait a minute, you're talking about this at dinner, you say?
Come on, come on, get the puritans!
Just the Berlin Trade of Fun Factory, which on the recognised designer Karim Rashid, served for the Intimity Body as inspiration.
It was opened in 2010 and it was completely another concept of erotic trade than all of them here.
No hidden exhibitions, all made in beautiful, decent, products made rather than in parfumeria.
Martin, with his business partner Zdenik Shebelka, began to consider how to take the practical business where it should be and how it should be named.
The name of Intimity was loved by both.
"Intimately, it's finally related to it and it's, it's, it's, it's, it's not, "saying.
She followed the purchasing of the Internet domain and searching for the appropriate room, which was parallelly with different internal visualizations.
Finally, she wined the variant, which distributed trade in the garden of the bedroom and the bedroom, which leads to bed.
The Dagmar Stepán from FormaFatal study prepared for us.
We found space in 2013.
First, he didn't appear to us perfectly because he was not on the main street, but again he was sitting in the name of Intimity.
He's intimate.
He's in the street near the main, so no one's cutting the clients," he's praising Martin Raj.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a trade that would be different, with a markable beautiful goods, in the area where women, which are mostly our clients, feel well.
And not to think they're going into such a business.
When I entered the Intimity boat a half hours ago, the street was going to be empty.
Moreover, I didn't even feel that I was going to trade with erotic helps.
I was soon surprised by the door by a clean internal elegance that I know from the bottles with mode.
Although there is only a female service in the business, that women don't want to ask for help, it doesn't mean that a man's feet would not be welcomed here.
Most of the gentlemen here are going to buy gifts for their girlfriend.
"The man can't consider the right size and choose more," Martin laughs over the common error.
That's the prejudices, that's the calmness that women have a great help, and that's not the truth.
So a man in good faith will choose a very big vibrator.
Similarly, men love the black cup, where the woman is just running to the red color.
Absolute bestseller is currently the product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face, it must be that I don't know who's running, because Martin's just explaining how it works.
It's such an insufficient clitorism stimulator.
Pere, a teenager in me, needs to look at the wonder of what a serious tone is given to me.
It wasn't like it wasn't.
And that doesn't really mean.
It's for a good price and has a perfect reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so well accepted.
It's about the last revolutionary news.
The revolution caused a vibrator in the sea coast.
He was concerned that women started more interesting on design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for we-Vibe couples.
He completely destroyed a tab that may survive in some men, and that they see competition in erotic helps.
"They're different variants," he's going on.
With one engine, with two engines, with a remote control.
That's a favorite category.
When a woman is kindly connected, a man can have a controller in his hand and specify the vibration intensity.
On the contrary, the closer step is a category of vibrator adjunctions.
So at least with us.
Czech women seem to predict multi-educational aid and buy classic vibrators, though they should only use it outside.
In Western Europe, mainly in the younger clients, it is very tragic.
What about men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I think it's supposed to take a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin says.
"And we have help for them, but in a ambiguous way." Mostly, the masturbator is selling, in this case from the producer of Tenga.
It doesn't look like anatomic vaginal imitation, but "which is like a cup gel or a cup or a future object.
They are very focused on ambiguity and life in use.
In Japan, it's totally different.
He's calling it a miracle in me.
I had the Japanese's suffering for herotic helps, I'm going to do it.
"This is the Internet reality," it's explained to me.
It's totally different.
Here in Europe, erotic helps are more associated with the use of women.
In Japan, they are totally normal for men, and they are tobacco for women." Only for interest - what the Japanese tag Tenga, which is in the Intimity bottle, sells worldwide, still creates half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czech and the Czech are not any drivings.
Instead, we're increasingly a nation.
Of course, to the country, such as the Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical trade client is moved between 35 and 50 years and "uses a certain experience with sexual life, but with helpful help.
It's gonna come for something nice, more quality that will complete a partner life, or for yourself." To return, Martin Raj's business partner Zdejk Shebelica's cares so that they are convinced that every product is perfectly low.
We also don't want to go to a special type of bondage and latex because we don't have room, but it's not going here.
Such things could reflect the things we're trying to do.
What are people who had the ostes to the sex shops because they feared that something like that would be on them.
As regards the production of products made on the pools, it is likely.
It is also given by the selection of renamed tags.
Some of them even obtained design prices, which is, in fact, Red Dot Design Award.
The first evaluated was a mentioned maritime horse, and this changed throughout the sector.
It started to leave from league materials, and rather to work with healthy unusual, began to produce other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that some of them stand after the design of the Czech Republic, even though the agency designer of Mareš.
I have to say that I am very surprised how many people have the design things Whoop.de.doo from Anna Mareses, although they're relatively lovers.
There's clients who walk directly for Venusin's bottle from Anna Mares.
She actually took a major job by opening exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic helps are different, beautiful, with history.
Anna's story started as school work.
Now it's about a prepared product that is also produced by us.
I wanted to have the process of production under control, and I also wanted to see what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not a big robot, but a little series, it's certainly more precise than a big series.
Maybe I'm going a little contrary to the run, but I think it's important to maintain the development in the Czech Republic.
It could be quietly that we're going to have nothing to do for a few years," she describes me the consent of Martin, which agrees that our company is more openly.
It does not match negative or rejecting position.
They're most like people's complaints.
"But then you will start to smile." Currently Mares has a vibrator offer that you can leave to make a personal message, and it also plans its own rubber gel for years.
In the next year, she should get vibrations and other news.
Foods of healthy sex
I'm interested in where the border of what's fine.
Is there something that Martin Raj wouldn't sell anymore?
It's very hard to define.
What one comes normally, the other can seem to be absolutely unusual, so we are more limited to the sort of label manufacturers.
None of them is allowed to be extrêmed.
Before we scare, I have the last question: What was the most stupid question they received?
Right now in the week, the e-mail was coming in which the lady asked a masturbation help for her friend with the nature of twenty-eight metres long.
So we had to write that we had nothing like that.
It's still a question if someone of us did not make a shame," Martin measures me as a suspicious view.
And that happens from time to time...
Tomorrow for Karla Gotta.
After two Alzheimer cancers!
His friend Karel Stédrý fights with a serious disease.
The best friend Karla Gotta fights with illness that will steal all the people.
"Yeah, it's despite the truth," he confirmed the silent information of Blesco's song himself.
I know about my illness, and then, in view of the circumstances, I'm overwhelming it.
"Barry the medicines that have a pregnant illness to relax," added it thanks to the nearby for support.
The whole developed family seemed to facilitate her life to Karl.
Eve’s wife is trying to be home, what is most like, behind his father's home at the White Mount, and the daughters of the first wife of Zuzan and Teresa, are older sons of Karel called Karlas.
He was two times fighting with cancer and his experiences, and he also delivered the Slovak to support him in his careful treatment.
He's got sixty chemotherapy behind him.
He was able to return to work and to the tennis curt and to the lingeries.
"On astrologe, I'm supposed to be here until ninety," Karel Blesk said.
It's a bitch.
He still wants to sing.
"I'm still saying a song that I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
With the same disease, it's already fighting in the establishment and the flower of Fial.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer in the family?
Look at how to keep on with him.
The Chile Parliament rejected the prohibition of interruption, the law shall judge the USE.
In Chile, there is no absolute prohibition for artificial interruption of pregnancy, thus not to be carried out from health care.
"They hate me that the legislators have committed a complaint to the Constitutional Court and that ten people will now decide what we have considered in Parliament for more than two years," the socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and the end of August should have a new president which is a close opposition according to the AFP.
Law for the destruction of the absolute interruption prohibited by the current president of Michelle Bachelet, adopted the Senate on 19 July.
The legal opposition later announced that the law would be attacked by the court because it denied the law of the unborn child to life.
The lawyers of voting on wearing the law last month have rejected it until the mixed parliamentary committee has been initiated.
In the middle of the lawyers, we were approved and the Senate acted again after them.
According to the new legislative adjustment, it should be stopped to be a criminal artificial interruption of weakness in three cases: if a woman's life is threatened, if the fruits have a survival, or if the weakness has occurred from violence.
Similar exceptions were available in the Spanish letter El País in Chile since 1931, so before the women received election right in 1949.
The absolute prohibition of interruption in 1989 introduced the right dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the President's office.
Chile is one of the small countries of the world where the absolute prohibition of interruption is payable.
Others are Nikaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are approximately 20 women in the neighborhood, which will be repeated to the thirty-year trial.
In many cases, according to human rights protectors of spontaneous torture, which the court signed as a murder.
Is something else sacred?
The other of Trump's White House is now Socha Freedom
The unfortunate change of the regime is critical.
The Americans could speak about it as well as all the rest - see the strictly incidence of Saddam Husain Society in the Bagdad area of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key representatives of Trump's regime, was certainly aware of what it is agreed when, during a debat with the reporter CNN Jim Acosto on the theme of the presidential advice to the drastic restriction of legal promotors, he expressed symbolic security on Soch Freedom.
He's listening to add that Miller didn't attack the shot like that.
That would cause him to get the owners of the aircraft ships and the Sochy Freedom's imitators.
However, he attacked her importance, particularly on the fact that in 1903 the plaquet was placed on the foundation of the glorious Emmy Lazarus, which was up to 17 years after a monument ended.
Miller urged Acostu: “I don’t want to go here to history, but Socha Freedom is... the symbol of the American freedom that stretchs the light over the whole world.
The bathroom which was located on the foundation is not part of it."
Miller has the reality, but as he said, it's not about history.
It is especially about the injury words of Emmy Lazarus, which are reasoning for today - not only immigrants, but the most stupid: "Let anyone come to me, who is a poor who is free to breathe, who is the poor one who smiles with the poor red in the full towns."
And just in modern times, we can see these "poor reds" on our screens anyway.
Miller did not try to criticize the poetry - he wanted to explain that these people weren't welcome in the United States.
This conflict on the importance of society is part of the comprehensive political and cultural war: it is, in fact, a conflict with the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as her friends, who after her death tried to set a plate with a basic base on the socha, had a good idea that it would go into a high political game.
Socha had to express the association of the French and American Government by representing classical subjects, so the freedom of women.
Emma Lazarus changed this importance: in her fashion there is no abstract women's position, but he has his own voice.
He also has a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
Communication fairly with a woman's imagination is a brilliant feminist box and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And the same way Emma Lazarus has changed the importance of the socket, the recognitors of the rights are trying to reject this importance.
The known commenter Rush Limbaugh - Jana Baptizer in Trump’s approach to power - in 2010 argumented that Socha Freedom will not call anyone to the country, but represents the early non-constructiveism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: “Socha Freedom is running forward.
He's expelled the origin of freedom from the United States and offered it the rest of the world.
The origin must not light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh's purchasing for an important thing.
The show of the sockets depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the socket from the view of a deceased and lost traveller, which often comes after long and scary flood through the ocean with a heart in a new country.
It is a view of the world with the eyes of people who are looking for attacks and chances for better life.
From this view, he expresses the socha in a rubber and listens to their needs.
And it's, of course, the perspective that Miller or Trump do not know.
Their origin is not to light the way, but to deceive the hatred that is their only source of power.
Mystery of the world in Athlete 2017: Neil Black sing praise to the Scotch members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle's exhibition at the time when the British team had only two Scotch members
The Director of the Athletic Federation of the United Kingdom Neil Black stated that the powerful box of 16 Scots in the World Mystery Team will be “a great contribution for the team”.
For MS in London, starting on Friday 2017, a recording number of Scotch atlets was selected.
BlackKeeps that in Scotland “a special thing” and the British atletic could learn from Scotland.
"We're trying to understand and adjust it, we'll work on it," said Black.
"I spoke to people from the Scotch sports institution and they think it's what they did.
The representatives of the Scotch athletics think it's what they've done.
British athletics: He has what they have done.
They also think that people are on the streets.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely incompatible."
A few Scotch atlets will strive for medails, including Laury Muirs and Andrewa Butcharta - who will cooperate with Sirem Mo Farahem in a bathroom of 5000 m while Eilidh Doyle was chosen for the team.
“Elith is humble.
"There's input word was inappropriate," said Black.
“Several atlets, whether Scot or atlets of other nations, have come out of a room with a sense of bitter happiness and motivation.
Your and your uncovered feelings, with which Elith has spoken, were unrepentant."
The Silver Medalist Commonwealthu, who will competite through 400 m in its fifth mistery of the world, stated that it is “increasing” in the British team of 16 Scotch atlets.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Only for the last five British and two European records, the refugees for the Mediterranean Trate of Muir set up only in the last year.
The MS will run 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scotches is Chris O'Hare, who runs a trace in 1500. In the year, British Teams and Agency Games have won.
Doyle's focus on its first mystery, which was the only other Scotch member of the Lee McCon.
The team captain led that he was "very proud" to the fact that the team had not only a large amount of her colleagues, but in many cases, they would have to attack the final and medails.
"I was chosen by the final members of the team. It was a great honour for me, but I thought the members of the team had chosen me to be happy about it," she added.
“Of course, I'm very proud of all Scots who got in the team.
He proves where I moved.
It's the athletes who'll think about the front places on the ground.
What about my introduction?
Yeah, I think she was.
I just warned the fact that we could be proud to the aircraft, because it's on the home ground.
It is important to use the support of household fans and to rejoice in the fact that we are back at the olympical stadium.
I got the second chance to get a divorce, and I'll enjoy an inconvenient atmosphere."
Crystal locking on Facebook: don't care about public if you don't bring a electric critical
Our father's authority was aware of his criticism.
The American George Washington loved, but the newspaper did not start to criticize her for anything, starts with foreign policy and ends its political views.
Yes, this criticism didn't delay her cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of manifestation can be removed from us - and stupid, and we will be led as sheep on the destruction."
This brings me to Maryland is Larry Hogan's maker, who's working to start keeping like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions at least 450 people who expressed their opinions freely on his official Facebook page.
This week the American Union for the freedom of citizens inquired her for this action.
The employees rejected the complaint as an inconsistent, and in comments on the Internet, many views of the type "who is interested".
"It's just Facebook," said many holders.
Yet, it's about it.
Especially at the moment when it's about people like Hogan.
In the absolute democracy state, it is an irrelevantly-republication of the Republic.
It may be the second highest favorite of all 50 persons.
Hogan isn't a guy.
It is evident that his state is aware of its own and closely complies with the principles.
It was also shown that it is rotative in using Facebook as a main cup to connect to its electors - except not even publishing the first photo with the holoe head after chemotherapy.
The blocking of people who hire on the website - which is a public forum, named as an official and managed employee payable from the money of tax payers - is inevitable and in the end dangerous result.
In a conversation for Washington Post Hoganov's journal, Amelia Chasse's speaker defended the locking of comments from the moderation of assets.
However, it is too easy to use the image of Internet trolls, spams or divorced people.
Washington Post told a number of people who were deleted by the contributions.
And they are the people who speak to their chosen leaders, the author, the businessman and the pastor, no troops.
As they all mentioned, their comments were fashioned and carefully, not injured.
The shepherd in his comments felt the Bible by calling Hogan’s Catholic faith.
A lawyer of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md. questioned hatred crimes, but her comment was not hated.
"I made notice that I was disappointed by his inadequate reaction to hateful crimes and other current reports," she wrote in the section with the commentary of Washington Post.
"I don't like the idea that, as a certain number of people look at the same subject, some people are designed to promote such collective efforts, rather than to be recognised as a higher group of interested citizens."
What the employees called "concentrated spam rate" would probably be called "country".
Modern Facebook ear allows us to easily manage the contributions by blocking critics or removing negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the street where they would collect and burn all pressures with criticism or arrest or kill protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public factor that will be criticized for Facebook and the rest of social media.
The President Trump sent the complaint from Twitter's chairmans, which has been rejected to his access.
One of the first important Regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first addition in Alexandria, according to the periodic judge James C. Cacherise, where she prohibited access to one of the electors to her Facebook page.
The Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentʹky also expected visits from LU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington’s times, the low price of post practice had the same effect as the Internet.
During 1776 to 1800, the number of daily prints was decreased and the position of his leader was doubted by many anonymous writers.
And even in those times, Washington had to arrange with anonymous trolls.
People, writers under pseudonims such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the news and doubted Washington's decision.
According to historic documents that people in the online project of Papers of George Washington Project, in his Office, broadcasted petitions criticising his statement on the agreement with the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Propertyation with British.
But he wasn't silent.
Freedom of manifestation, ungodliness and fear lies on the basis of our people's own.
And the leader must accept it.
Czech Republic uses free roaming, in a carrier with more data than home.
Czech has more from his tariff than home.
They are most often moved to Russia, but the confusion of data in the year is conducted in Croatia.
However, they have more time to browse on the web, and they do not have any option to connect to the Wi-Fi under the sun.
Beach, buying, and smart phone in your hand.
So it looks like a typical Czech authorised in Croatia after the clients can use the services of dark operators for home prices.
It comes from O2's fresh company.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, the percent of Czech travellers in the carrier has more data available in the area of the puzzle than home.
It is therefore not wonderful that in Croatia, where our minimum is running through the winter, it has been necessary for even fifty-five years ago.
On the other hand, Italy placed the data needed in the cave.
In most minutes, the Czech speaks out of Germany, where many are exposed to work and during the years.
Croatia, according to the date of the Association of the Czech Travel Offices, visits the yearly to 800 thousand Czech, is so our most earlier destination.
However, people here have changed the book for the share of experiences using the mobile phone.
The record was on June 7th.
"To the transfer data there would be ten millions of photographs," she explained the details of the mobile segment manager in O2 Silvia Cieslar.
Though Croatia takes data, the highest number of Czech people moves in neighbouring countries.
In the first place, there is Russia, following Germany and Slovenia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is six.
In Russia, we express a better tourist and active allowance that we don't have so much time to brochure on the Internet.
"Czech also moves to Jadran through the Russia," explained Cislar.
While datamenal operator after release of roaming payments is higher interannual growth, the phone growth is much lower.
The beginning of minutes operated in roaming has grown up for a long-term year to double.
With a huge shock before the rest of the countries, Germany is here.
"Wolking in roaming is more useful by fireman clients on work roads," added Cieslar.
Ronan Rafferty trusts in the home atmosphere in Renaissance Club
The former golf unit Ronan Rafferty will be hoped in the atmosphere at Renaissance Club in the Scotch administration of East Lothian, which is in the 25th year of Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from North Ireland, last year on the nearby Golf Game Archerfield Links after the road to the final, set up Paul Eales. In the years he will play the role of the ambassador of turns in the establishment of the club founder and the CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've followed my Renaissance Club quickly grown in front of my eyes and the airport will show the world his beautifulness," Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to love the primary classic quality of the game.
Jerry took a great job.
He's a bitter coach of this game, and he's proud of his success.
The aircraft is in the right hands."
Anglican Eales will first have a mysterious title, despite the winning of the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during its 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling," said the southport golfist.
“I had no chance to find my winning at Extremadura Open, because the tournament was cancelled after my winning year.
Return to this part of the country is cool.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I'm going to take the past year when Sharon and my wife meaned a very powerful game for me and my wife.
It was beautiful times that I won't forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after he celebrated 50 years from the country of the year.
This event will be his first complaint from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I'm always playing on home ground," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want it to happen to you, and then you feel a big pressure.
I really played again, and I think it's good for me.
I'm happy with a successful outcome."
Three players are also connected to the game by the former winner Masters Ian Woosnam and the victories of the senior tours Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former competition Ryder Cup Sam Torrance belongs to six Scotch players in the game; the finals are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Incoming on the tour is free. Parking is 5 £ per car with one traveler and 10 £ per car with two and more travelers.
All wins will be acquired of Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian country of gold
When Bardina Degei's dinners, he doesn't use a message.
Only sometimes he uses a gentleman.
In his tree chatch, which is located in the main town of Mrs Enarotali in Indonesian province of Papua, the woman usually walks a sweet bramber - in the word of local "notes" - directly in the fire.
After a half hour, we'll get out of the bramber, and we'll be silent on her with the hands that's cool.
The bardin is sitting on a black land - a house is not equipped with a habitat - where it does his daily work, for example, e.g., burning woods in the swimming water from a nearly powerful power.
The bathroom in the room without a shot supplies the toilet.
As the youngest of the four women of her husband, no field was assigned to her.
Polygamie is running here.
Work in the late night hours represents dangers: The number of men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
“Nobody can move around the village after five hours,” says Bardina.
It is a rare view of the daily life of Papui, the former Netherlands colony, announced in 1969 as part of Indonesia, after the controversial reference, when only 1026 elders were given to vote in the form of public dealing with the hands before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Netherlands rules has turned its wrath against the Jacques Government, which has controlled the whole region, with exception of civilian journalists or supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - the independent Papua-New Guinea occupied the east part of the island.
Enarotali is so remote and devastated town, where you will get after ninety minutes from the capital province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-year swimming ship.
It doesn't work in this place.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants is assembled from wooden houses covered by bambus plates, wooden wheels in grass and red colors.
There were only little Indonesians in this place, but the journalists, and practically no strangers.
Before Christians arrived, local inhabitants worshiped God by name Uga Tameee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't usually wearing these shoes," says Bardina, showing his colourful, handly flat tree, dark trick and dark cup.
"We were wearing only lists before."
Papua is the most worst province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives under poverty, and now the child's death and gratitude is one of the worst in all Asia.
However, it is the Indonesian gold country.
The biggest and most famous gold depth in the world of Grasberg, which owns Freeport McMoran from the United States Phoeenix, is located only 60 miles from Panai - the scalned province about the size of New Jersey, which is about 153 000 people home.
Only in 2015, Freeport won the gold and ear in value of $3,1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports the weight of wood in the estimated value of 78 billion dollars.
However, these riches are for the Papuanic source of suffering and insurance of the strong Indonesian armies.
From the survey that the new York Times reported in 2005 shows that Freeport paid to local military factors and approximately 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004, including 150 000 dollars for one taxor.
Papuants who call on self-control threaten this golden house and therefore are strongly threatened.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 Papuants have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been violated, triggered and arrested by Indonesian Army.
Mass murders in Papua's tribe in the past 70th century were equal to genocides, as introduced by the Asian Commission for Human Rights.
Only last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protestants in the region.
In Will Lose Everything, the news of Brisbane arctics of 2016, describes the cruelity of the past year, as a mimosuous correction, torture - according to the next news, it is particularly an annual violence and correction of electrical pumps - and brutal treatment of peace demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, because it comes to incidents every week," said Andreas Harson, the Indonesian researcher of the Human Rights Watch.
The whole of the fact that Papua resources are attached to Indonesia colonists.
From 3.5 million people today are 83% reported to Christianity, but demography changes with the influence of Muslim immigrants from Indonesia - Javy, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawes.
Japanese cantines sells the frozen cow and gado-gado or mixed greenine with arised coat.
Local people fight for survival.
“Imigrants began to sell cotton and greenine on traditional markets for less prices than local Papuaans” explains the 40-year Abeth You, who was born in Panaia and moved to work in the main town of Jayapura.
"PPuy inhabitants of Papua - mama-ma (women) - so they lost their job."
In 2014, the Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who overcomes Joko, promised his presidential campaign to solve inequality and violation of rights.
The former teacher safeguarded his road to the presidential palace in just 27 of the 29 dicts of Papui, especially Mrs.
But this changed very little in Papua, and local people feel disappointed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the idea that they would hear our calls for justice," said You.
The fact is that only two months after the October inflation of Jacob, you have experienced a great shock.
7. In 2014, the group of 11 children sang a winter song in the town of Enarotali, when two Indian soldiers were thrown out of the night.
Two of the surprised kids told them that they had to switch lights.
One of the soldiers introduced this exhibition and the tone to which the touch had been exhausted and later returned to four other soldiers, the local Farague Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the lowly state followed the group of children and killed them by their weapons, introduced victims and witness events.
One of the soldiers then burned on a group of children.
One of the children, the 16th Yulianus Yeimo, was so strongly killed that he fell into the comma.
In a few hours later, somebody burned a little long building of electoral commissions, and the next day the matters were still developed.
Approximately 1,000 youths of Papuaian men and women were deceived at the Balabal crystal before local police station and military officers, and they demanded justice.
They came with the official lottery lamps and made a dance waita - where it runs in the circle and imitates the song of birds - the Papua town Mee Pago.
A few protestants started to go on the building of stones.
“When you try at least three times to resist, you have the allowance to shoot, ” said the TIME week in the official document, whose content never was published in local media.
Jeremia Kayame (56), the leader of the fourth Enarotali Kego Koto, spread a threatening danger and invited the inhabitants to spread into their homes.
Nevertheless, no one had his words.
"When I turned back, somebody shot me in the left cup," said TIME for a week on the wheel of his wooden house.
Kayam doesn't know who was a shooter yet, but, according to his words, the bullet was one of the present soldiers.
"The people were all around, and they shot a lot," he added to it.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was set three times, according to his sister's words, who was a witness of shooting.
"I fled to the body to convince me that it was the truth he," she said in the weekly TIME with the misunderstanding voice of Yohanes, which as many Indonesians only uses one name.
"I saw he was dead... I loved him."
Papua police inspector, general Yotje Mende, reporters reported that his students were only "saving" the station under attack.
"We have to protect us when people threaten us to death," he said in 2015, the printing of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistio.
"It's a question of life and death."
According to the human rights Watch organization, five protestants were killed, and many were hurt.
The report on murder was broadcast by the Jacques media next day.
Three weeks ago, Joko offered a tongue in Jayapura and made his understanding for the families of victims and promised that he would take care of violence in Papua.
"I need a immediate solution to this problem to never be repeated," he said.
The National Security Minister Viranto announced in October 2016 that he would carry out an emergency mechanism to resolve violent actions that occurred in the past.
Soon, but they started calling for excuses.
“The number of violent acts has been achieved a long time.
Some of them were attacked in the past 90 ’ s and some at the beginning of the 21th century.
It's saying that we're determining these violent acts, but it's a simple task," he said.
In the discussion of 5 June for the week of TIME, which was held in Jakarta, however, Viranto claimed that he would not plan to take any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be subjected to the court”.
Viranto, who was committed by the United Nations from the "kriminality against mankind" on the basis of more than one thousand dead in the 1999 independent elections in Eastern Timor, stated that 11 cases of human rights violation in Papua, in particular the incident in Mrs.
The family of the shooting victims in Youa welcomed his statement with uncertainty.
"In the last three years, I was asked four times, but I did not expect anything until now," said Yohanes.
"I'm hungry."
As he says, a few years later he lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he says.
"I'm afraid the army will catch me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many people of Ladies who feared the incident to speak.
According to his words, the military members killed him after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"When the body was buried, I started looking for the army," he said.
And the shooting isn't yet.
The Indian police shot in the neighborhood of Deiya.
To the road where one person and the other 17 were dead, there occurred between the villages and the building company manager, who refused to provide help in the transport of a man in an unconscious hospital.
Ravia · Douw (24), who was thrown on fishing in the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The divorced villages protested before the building company.
According to the police of the villages, the villages were thrown after the appropriate stones and their answers were a warm shot.
However, local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonian paramil) started to shoot into the dawn and killed one person.
"The panic was, we were afraid of the refund," he introduced for TIME 29-year Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness to the hurt.
"I didn't get out of my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament requested the visit of the involved police officers and the mobile brigade station.
You were for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development is simply devoted to the destruction of the people of the people of the stages of Mee, Mona, Dani and Damal who live in central highlights.
Many of them have joined Papuai - the army of the rebellious armies that protect the rights of the Papuaans by attacking and violating the Indonesian police.
Some of the leaders of OPM entered from Mrs. Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks of the army in the past years, the military has been arrested and willingly held thousands of people of Mrs.
Some of them will never see anymore.
You are known as “traditional and forgotten place” among the inhabitants of Papuai.
Oil brings poverty into fire.
The little rise that is sold in Enarotali is too love for local.
And bread is the same unusual.
More people now cultivate their food: mainly sweet brambers, fruits and sheet zelenine.
Women work in the field; each of them works four or five fields with sweet portions.
Most glass is designed for family needs, the rest is selling in the local market.
Ten kiss of sweet brambers are only 10 000 indonese rupies (75 cents).
Since the time that the Nabire airport has opened more aircraft roads and has started to exploit new immigrants, the growth of the economic inequality between the Papuan family and the promotors is grown.
A few workplaces are currently increasingly higher educational and richer immigrants.
Papuants often have a need for education and training to be able to go to business.
"Young people move from the village to the lack of jobs and money," John Gobai, President of the Staff Council, said.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
It also contributes to serious rules for the journalists.
At the beginning of the year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were released from Papua from the beginning of the year, but they had so rare permissions to film.
Phelim China, the representative of the Asiaian Association of Human Rights Watch, promised Joko in his electoral campaign to abrogate the cruel rules for journalists and the achievement of transparency and development. However, it never happened.
“Appeal journalists who work in the most exhausted areas of Papua and Western Papua are threatening a big risk: not recognition of visions and recording on the black list,” he stated in the declaration.
The lack of reports from the per-professional journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesia in the case of Papui is limited to a significant measure.
In March, six peaceful nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the Council of the United Nations Human Rights on the investigation of "different and extended violent actions" in Papua, including shoots in Panai.
These countries also supported OPM in the past.
The Indonesian Language ministerial of Arrmanath Nasir has rejected the accusation when he declared to journalists in Jakarta that “in Indonesia, the democratic system and media are free, so it is difficult to mask the evidence of the cases of human rights corruption.”
Local people call for the governments.
When the official delegation from Netherlands, in the context of the sentence of human rights of Kees Van Baar, visited the 4 May Jayapurau, local people operated according to the resources that also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the password “We want freedom”.
For 2019, further choices are planned in Indonesia, but the Papuants say they will call Jokowi.
"Joko is a man who has good intentions, but is circumcised by the people associated with the shooting in the Panai," Gobau said, the president of the tribe.
He wants Jokovi to realize that the people of Mrs. Ladies, other than that they live in an inconsistent fear of the hostile armies, fight in poverty, mild education and health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Lady, as the rest of Papua, consider their voice as a “debt” that must pay to Joko.
"They don't want money, they require justice," added.
Despite the threats and threats of family victims of the Panaiian shooting, the last symbolic act of breathing continues: the funeral of the body of victims on the ground towards the police and military station.
I believe that justice has never been done enough, at least they will not allow the responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"It was killed a member of our family," Yacobus said with a crowded head.
"What can we do?"
The French marinership took a major cocaine supply to Australia.
The French marinership was held in the Pacific jachto of 1,46 tonnes of cocaine in a value of $256 million.
The carrier moved to Australia.
At the ship, the four-year vessel was arrested, which obviously creates people from Lithuania and Latvia.
It was named Afalina, and she went out from South America, and the police took her away from the city of Nouméa, the metropolis of the French sea territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Rapporteur Service noted that in cooperation with its international partners, he would make it possible to determine exactly where and where the drugs are concerned and to discover "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs in Australia," said its Executive Director Col Blanch.
Drogy was destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is for high street prices of drugs with an attractive goal for their potatoes.
The earth also faces the increased number of people suffering from drug dependence.
It's not the last time.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large quantity of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to pass through the Pacific Ocean in a small airport.
Seniors don't feel hurtful, they need drinking.
The problem may be in houses for elders, a solution according to the doctor of Geriatrical Clinic General Faculty disease in Praza Pavly Madloveva could be a physiological inflation that is covered by the powder under the skin.
But you're still applying only in health equipment.
Whatever a man is older, it makes much more water in his body.
"And also lost feeling awesome, so the senators generally accept less fluid and dehydrate very much," said Madlova.
Two litres should be drinking sure.
"But getting to an old man is a big problem," she added.
In the houses for elders, no doctor often observes it.
In illnesses, dehydrates are currently resolved by infuses.
"I think there should be a degree for them to get subcutaneous infuses," she said.
On the day it says, it can add to the elderly people to two physiological lights.
The lack of fluid may cause minority, head pain and reduce performance.
Dehydration is apparent as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"Every day the old man will say that he can't rise from bed, he's talking hard," she added.
In the case of disturbance, it can be cut off until the brain occurrence.
The blood is devastated and puts the blood into the brain, also threatening renal failure.
Leaving patients should not be covered by a pearl, maximally covered space.
The problem can also be a single piece.
"It's much more careful, but it's ideal for a patient to discover and let the skin go," said the doctor.
In Dubai he already burned the Torch
In Dubai, one of the largest lived darknesses of the world had to evacuate all 337 meters high and 79 patrol buildings.
In the last two years, the second fire of this exhaust building is already called The Torch (Origin).
All the builders were evacuated, and they did not come to any hurt.
"We slept and wake up the alarm, and we heard the cry.
We had ten minutes before we moved down from the 50th quarter," he said to Re·s Geroge, one of the people of darkness.
Dubaiian civil defense noted that the farmers were able to get fire under control about the fourth hour of the random (0:00 GMT), thus continued to cover the building.
Governing representatives have added to ensure replacement accommodation for achieved residents.
Incidence could be able to resume the debate on the safety of materials used for the creation of high buildings throughout the world.
From the results of the investigation that started the leading of Torch's darkness after fire in 2015, resulted that the most damaged areas and external panels were used for decoration or isolation.
The British police noticed that the isolation and the isolation system of the London Greenfell Tower could contribute to the spread of fire at the red fire, where almost 80 people were lost.
The results of the research showed that more than one of the five travelers to the United States produces prohibited items on the aircraft
The investigation between travellers showed that more than twenty per cent of them had been prohibited by controling the American Government Agency Transportation Security. At least six per cent of the travelers entered the aircraft with a football or another oil object.
Less than one percent of travelers claimed that they were promptly trying to travel with shoot weapons, munitions or explosions.
From the results of the investigation that Stratos Jet Charters Inc conducted, and responsed more than 1000 questions - showed that in younger travelers, there is more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried to travel with the subject prohibited by TSA was 19.7 per cent of traveling with those thousands of hours in comparison with less than 15 per cent of the members of Generation X.
Among the most current subjects that avoided the attention of TSA belong to food and alcohol.
More than three percent of the respondents have passed through the care of an easier subject, while 2,2 per cent of women concerned and 3,7 per cent of men concerned also admitted that they were intended to carry out the aircraft forbidden drugs.
The company noted that it had conducted research between travelers throughout the world in order to make sure how many of them were appropriately carried out unleavened subjects through the aircraft control and how this had been adequately affected.
It is not surprised that a number of people who have transferred unleavened objects - whether or not, the aircraft is very often traveling.
As the company highlighted, the TSA Directives are sometimes complicated and mature.
People often don't know what flows and in what quantity they can carry into the aircraft.
It is therefore not surprising that the TSA enjoyed the largest quantity of the netly prohibited liquids.
At a time, people thought that TSA would make books the same way as with feeding goods.
The transmission of fluctuants is allowed in the form of foreign years, nor international.
Boss EPA Scott Pruitt on the depth of the planned directives for the reduction of Obam's administration
After the Agency for the Protection of Life Agency was charged by 15 States, her boss Scott Pruitt rejected its previous decision on the delay of the implementation of the plan of the former Obam's administration on reduction of carbon oxide.
Pruitt has made changes in its plan, and he reacts more closer than previous governments to the needs of State environmental regulators.
However, he did not change the legal challenge imposed against his previous position in the Federal Revocation Court.
This is the last term set out on 1 October when the States should begin to comply with the Regulation of 2015 on the reduction of the quantity of the foreign ozone.
In June, Pruitt noted that the agreement would be issued for one year and ordered a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “the decisions of local decisions or a threatening economic growth”.
Preutt, which, before arrived in the role of the EPA Chairman Donald Trump, set up the position of the national prosecutor of Oklahomy, served as a sustainable refusal of the closer environmental regulations.
Since the time he sat in Washington, Pruitt repeatedly moved or removed regulations for chemical and phosphile industry.
The main legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda is the shortage of the mediator.
Last month, the Federal Revocation Court in Washington decided that the EPA producer had overcome his authority in trying to deal with Obam's administration plan, which required that the oil and gas companies reduce the metane units.
In the statement issued in the middle of the evening, Pruitt enhanced its version of the ozone standards and enhanced the EPA commitment to cooperate with States using complex processes and implementing new standards in the given timeline.
"For the previous government, the EPA administration often did not complete the terms and expected when it was charged by activist groups and final groups, agreed with the equation and other plans," Pruitt, who in its previous position had granted more than twenty complaints to EPA.
“We do not believe in the regulation by means of the courts and the terminal fulfillment we are seriously.
We never disappoint our statute and authority that comes from."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can at a certain point use “the possibility of longer and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that regulations will be based on healthy policies and most available information.
The Republicans at the conference are pressed on a larger translation of the ozone rules.
The start of the White House, approved last month, is attempting to delay the implementation rules of 2015 at least eight years.
Watching hasn't gone through the senate yet.
The New York General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who stood in the head of the country coalicy, who claimed this week EPA, stated that the group would not be allowed in legal pressure.
"The views of the EPA - followers of our judicial overseer - is an important victory for the health and security of 6,7 million of those unemployed and more than 115 million Americans who are without prejudice to the air pollution," added Schneiderman.
New York has joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, 日, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pensylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Eastern ozone occurs when running damaged substances of cars, electricals, raffiners, chemical electrics and other resources react in the atmosphere with sunset.
An exciting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and every year thousands of preliminary deaths.
The authorities of the public health and the environmentalists of Pruitt are invited to be thankful.
"It's anxious of how pressure should be developed, and they have changed the thoughts of responsible persons and protected the air we breath," said Lori Ann Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We need to continue to match the ideological secret of the Trumpo Administrative, who is trying to help disappointers and special interests."
Polylius man with oxygen, but it's not dangerous according to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
One moment you're home with your family, and you're laughing, and the second will change your whole life from the bases.
And the worst is that you can't do anything with it.
Similar judgment met Andrease Christopherose from the Great Britain, whose face was sealed with an unknown attacker, who finally was disappointed by the wine.
The information you entered in the Re日s web.
In June 2014, someone at Christopheros closed the door.
Andreas was sure he'd be opened.
He's got that he's probably a curiour outside the door that day for the family's birthday.
Instead of this, there was a bad surprise.
The man whom he never saw in life, immediately after opening him without warning, he popped oxygen with the words, "This is for you, friend."
That pain was unwritable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing, and I just felt an inevitable pain on the skin," Andreas said.
The family brought him to the hospital, but there his neighbors learned a terrible message -- according to the doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would follow the infection that threatened to get into his wound.
His hurt was very serious.
From nineteen per cent, the face that the doctors tried to give inheritance to the other parts of the body.
A great complication for Christopherose became a loss of eyes.
It's probably the most poor thing I've survived.
"You can't hide before the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described your suffering.
Today Christopheros has 12 operations that are not the last.
Incidences that suffer the victims of oxygen attacks may, according to plastic chirurgs, require hundreds of chirurgical steps and years of treatment.
Even after healing and treatment, the victims of the fat has been found until the end of life.
"The people sometimes are not deceived and in the entire life fight against deformation and destruction," said Professor Peter Djewulski, British speaking associations of plastic and esthical chirurges.
The flighter's broken.
As regards the attack, Christopheros is sure the unknown man had to break him with someone.
He believed that he felt a man who sexually hurt his neighbor.
The whole case was investigated and the attacker followed.
The husband was appealed to at least eight years of negotiation.
However, Christopheroso’s family's verdict was mainly changed.
"The three judges finally concluded that the punishment should be canceled, because a man is not considered as a threat to publicity," Christopheros said.
In recent years, the number of attacks with feeding substances has increased significantly.
The Dark Ministry inside has been addressed to the problem so that it plans to set up new instructions to the State representatives on the classification of cereals.
You should be included between dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not determined to be delivered.
They request that the Government of the Great Britain make a more harder and longer crime to take freedom to people who attack their surroundings with oxygen or other feeding substances.
Moreover, they require that controls of the sales of dangerous substances which are often running to get in different businesses, as it is a different cleaning cycle.

Peking is about a billion.
Since decades, China is trying to apply its influence without the use of forces.
A year, it costs ten billion dollars to support language schools and universities, press their entertainment, and try to join west tourists.
But that doesn't happen to Peking.
Dark State media are talking about the plan to make the tourism for economic changes and modernization.
However, the start of income was only 3,8 per cent and 80 per cent of tourists came from Hong Kong, Macao and Thaiwan.
It is, in contrast, affected by the fact that, despite all its global aspiration, China does not know foreigners just with open hands, the value of the world's most poorest economy professor from the Peking University of Christopher Balding in the article for the Agency Bloomberg.
An example that speaks about everything is a Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have a freedom with China, the citizens of those finals need to make a vize with a prejudice.
Therefore, the Chinese authorities in the United States are taxes comparable to the celebrations of the new Chinese year.
The visa is 140 dollars, but if a person doesn't want to wait for long hours in the front, he must pay 100 dollars and more for additional services.
Such restrictions constitute significant economic obstacles.
Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visa decreases the number of visits to the country by 70 per cent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited Pe≤n China, while Hongkong, who shared less than three percent in China, and lived there less than one percent of the population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often discourages this problem when the tourism moves to implement its political objectives, such as in conflict with Thai-wan and South Korea.
When China had limited the transport to South Korea in the area of the South Korean anti-racet system, the South Koreans paid it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits passed by 42 per cent, while Japan increased by 85 per cent.
All this affects the economic stability of the euro.
According to recently published reports of the American Central Bank Fed, China could leave up to 190 billion dollars, while China sold the currency to the income tourists annually wins approximately 35 billion dollars.
According to the official numbers of payment balances, China had 217 billion dollars in the tourism for a latest year, which is equal to 44 per cent of the total Chinese residence in trade with goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists of the country, which is due to the prevention of the exhibition, is very painful.
However, their named factors are only the most common evidence of sustainability towards foreigners.
In many places of China, no one heard about immigrant practices.
Moreover in 2013, there were less than million strangers in China.
More of them in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which isn't just a cross-quality, has a double range.
A number of works shows that immigrants usually survive economic growth, business and innovation.
However, there are no practices in China.
Solving these problems will be politically urgent, but the step that is offered is simplifying the visual apparature.
Other Asian states, namely India and Vietnam, have recently developed a great effort to simplify and wrong-doing procedures to provide visions.
China wants more foreign tourists and their strong currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the spring zoo, they multiplied deathly eating plates.
The Kingdom of Pleasure I go can enjoy youths just three rare, deadly eating plasmas.
In the exhibition of visits, only all nine of those who are born in the middle of the Turkish dragon will be seen.
This species lives in the North Anatolia, which is also in the oversea height of 2000 meters.
"The long and metro length," described the speaker of Martin Vobruba.
Youths of the remaining two species, deaths, and when the red are, then they will build strength in the covator land of the garden.
We can't say when people will see them yet.
"Don't have come about them," said the doctor Miroslav Dohnal with that it can take a year or two.
The Australian Death Smiths have come to the world eight, these are the descendants of a polythetic couple of polytheists in Sydney.
"The only person whose visits can see in the exposure belongs to the mortal ones in the surrounding Perth," Vobruba said in human care is needed for mortal winter for 6-8 weeks at the temperature of 13 degrees Celsia.
Great succeeded the African snow floating wheat.
The park in the spring zoo was cut out of four eggs in total four youths.
"Incubation was 65 days," supplemented Vobruba.
This species in the nature of its victims is cutting up to four meters away.
He's looking at the eyes, he can cause the permanent blindness.
Youths of all three species live in the zoo with the mouse.
By 40 days in the garden, youths are still expected to be young from the black mother's snow, the ovens are stored in the incubator.
According to an uncertain rescription of the phone chat, Trump creates Mexico pressure for payment for the wall
The American Journal of Washington Post published a record of the phone talks of President Trump with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In the telephone discussion of 27 January with the Mexican President Enrique Peñou Niet Trump urged her to stop publicly declare that he would not pay for building on the wall.
The American President recalled him that he publicly rejected the building of the wall, givenly saying, "You can't speak like this in printing."
Trump in his campaign promised that he would set the wall down the south borders and declare that she would pay Mexico for her.
To the public, he also dismissed his first talk with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, discovering the increasing exchange of opinions.
The President Trump said to Turnbull that the United States supervision agreement on the survey to Australia is "smile" and "glaw" and that if he agreed with such agreement - which took the President Obama's Government - would look like "druged" after it had prohibited the income of the attackers to the United States.
Trump talk ended after Turnbull explained that “This is my most amazing talk day”.
Tusk again spoke to the prosecutor for Smolene.
"It's worried about what," said Brother of the Dead President of Tusk, President of the Governing Party of Justice and Justice of PiS Jaroslaw Kachiński.
"I don't care, Kakinski will not scare me," answered Tusk and said to the current leadership of the country, trying to disuse justice against political supporters.
When he went out of the procurement seat, he waited to Tuska according to TVN 24 dav, which scandous Donald Tusk! and wanted to politics 100 years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clean conscience: "I don't have any fear and Kakinski doesn't scare me."
The prosecutors, according to their words, do not recall anything, but it doubts that the justice has to serve the Polish governments now as a tool against companions, opposition or people who do not have any respect, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He's already been in the hearing.
Expremier was already heard on the procurement, this time he had the challenges to face doubts on the drinking of the victims of the Roman disaster.
Moreover, the replacement of the body in the cancers came.
The families were prohibited to open cancer, and they must have been the same.
And the fact was that they were afraid of scandal because he would make the Poland-Russian relationships hard.
"Holding good relationships at every price, despite such a terrible event, should serve that Donald Tusk become some very important in the EU," Kakinski said in the Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that the eventual conflict with Russia would distort Tusk the possibility of getting the most important cross in the Union, which, however, does not have anything from Poland.
Kakinian also declared that he warned the German officer Angela Merkel that it could be different with Donald Tusk, but she didn't take it in the house.
Tusk has made eight-year prosecutor votes already on April 19.
He didn't even speak as a suspect, just as a witness.
However, many of his votes were considered part of the clear efforts of the Polish Government and the Chief PiS Kachiński to discredit Tusk as a political support by associating different scandals.
The prosecution is undergoing the Minister for Justice in Poland, which fills the role of the general prosecutor.
The vote to the vote came after the choice of Tuska by the Chef of the European Council, which Kakinian was exclusively, but tried to defend, notwithstanding the visit of Merkel in Varsovia.
On the summit of the EU against the duration of the Dusk mandate, only the Polish Prime Minister Beata Sydlow protested on the end.
In this case, he left Varšava at the holidays and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Masakr in Moore's Ford: Activists remembered racist lynching
Ford Mercury from 1948 passed around observers of Monroe, Georgia and codercal with the direction of Moore's Ford.
Nevertheless, before the four passengers of the black bottle and the white driver arrived to the pool, a group of white weapons had replaced him.
The leader of the group - a man of the center of the clothes in the dressed clothes - he dropped out of the cigarettes and looked at the head of the car.
Inside the travelers were scared of fear.
"We want it, and Roger!" said the man.
"Bring him to me!"
Silence breaks the rock of the young black, which is taken out of the seat of the coach.
This scene is, for fortunately, only the reconstruction of the event reached on July 22.
But when one of the men passes through the Roger's cross of the road, the community will breathe up with a surprise.
Since 2005, the Moore's Ford returned regularly a group of activists who rebuild that summer night in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey killed the members of Kukluxclan.
No one was judged for murder yet.
"It is wonderful that all those years the only person has not been arrested - even though we are still seeing it in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks was allowed to listen to the restructuring of events.
"It's an uncle on our story, and it's wounded in our souls."
Brooks is an ex-71-year congressman of Georgia and a whole-life fight for citizens' rights.
In his eyes, it represents the restructuring of the event a dramatic challenge to do. Each year, Monroe's community believes that justice has not been done enough.
"We are requesting the courtyards and closing the case, we want peace in mind and peace, but primarily justice," Brooks said.
“The process of health and refreshment cannot be started until that time.”
On July 27, 1946, the Court of Justice covers one of the bodies of Moore's Ford linching victims.
According to the FBI writes that received the NBC News report, the linening should have participated up to 50 men from Monroe and the environmental periods.
Nevertheless, no one has been judged yet.
Despite the suspicion remains in freedom after decades, civil rights suppliers claim that both of the debt of lingering - policy and sex - were known to all citizens.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice, Georgia's people's black ships were first entitled to make the elections planned for the year.
And just during the years of elections, the FBI said that the black farmer of Roger Malcom had to get the owner of the white barnets of Barnett Hester - evidently for his wife.
In the town, Brooks said Hester was traveled to communicate with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and brought her into another condition.
For the exhibition of the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the significant owner of the white landscape Loy Harrison for Malcom buying $600.
Dorothy and the neighbors Mae Murray and George Dorsey were delivered to the branch office.
When you return from the coast, just before you came to Moore's Ford, a group of suspects replaced them.
"How it was shown, he planned murders and organized Harrison," the FBI said.
"It is also apparent that a secret agreement has been made between the State and local law defenders who have not only been broken down but also dismissed of evidence and hided the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks was more expert for the whole matter.
“It was a massacre for electoral rights,” he said.
“The stars have always had a subtext for all local people of black floor: ‘This is where you will fall if you are registered and go to choose’.”
An annual event rebuilding in Moore's Ford is organizing about ten years of Cassandra Greene.
Its representation is formidable, empowerable and exciting. It shows deeply corrupt racism, which many would consider in modern America as a disappeared.
Following this restructuring is not easy, and it's even more difficult to turn the air, but Greene says that it has its sense.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face the inappropriate feelings that will be hidden in each of us," Greene said.
"And there can be a relationship between us if you don't listen to what I had to go."
The aeroplane restructuring tests started in June and immediately the first day was about 30 hearts - twenty whites, the rest of black - entered into the room where Greene met with a very carefully planned representation.
Wade Marbaugh makes the position of the assistant register.
For many years, he played the leader of Kukluxclan, but according to his words, the role is exciting.
"I have a bad feeling because it resists who I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think this part of history is very important to be regularly at the time, because we never want to return to that time."
Herci Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, playing Roger Malcom's role, we'll put Barnett Hester on their role.
The presentation begins with the trip - Malcom agrees with Hester and guilty him that he slept with his wife.
“Return out of my ground n-e!”
Rascona doesn't give it.
It's going to the road.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black bowl) will explode in smiles.
Greene's laughing out of all the most.
"What happened?" He asked Rascon.
He's wounded.
Did I be too deep?
"No," Greene's awesome sector.
"I just don't think the whites were called 'n-r' tone."
"Exactly," one of the hearts of the black floor.
"You're gonna have to classify the highest point on R."
Energy in the room is once better; enemy replaces the feeling of a closeness.
Everyone wants to be a presentation, just to be made for enough four massacre victims.
Hercians' scene repeat.
Rascona, this time, refers to the correct expression of the words to N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The presentation ends violently.
Rev, shoots... and still silence.
The woman clothed in black stands over the body of the hearts and sings a treasury song of Billie Holiday "Strang Fruit".
With every word, it's in the room to feel triumph.
At the back of all of this, some twelve watchers struggle the road and swords from the eyes.
The association is practically the same number of black and white.
One couple arrived from the New York Ithacy, many watching them out of the nearby area.
Each of them carries the local flames of the air about eight hours, and Brooks is leading to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until this moment, the murder could be seen with a decline, but now, standing at the same place where it came to linch, the atmosphere is terrible.
With the last words of the song, he calls Greene's giving the inspectors of the body.
Children swear to the heads of the victims, follow false blood and un moved body, and shoot something into their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy's wounding.
He's running a few minutes and Greene's thanks to the presence.
The herds pull the lana and strike their lakes.
Bradshaw includes Marbaugh, a man in clothing, who played the leader of Kukluxclan.
Nick Rascona, let's include our two friends-herce and weep in their hands; finally, emotional.
"It's all right," one of the women's kidding.
"We know that the role is to you.
But you had to do it."
After the same day, the community shall sit together with the dust to dinner.
At one table, young white couples are talking about the presentation with the black couple they have met today.
Denise Duplinski's Society had a word that would make her feelings from today's presentation.
"It is difficult to listen to these disgusting words and to look at those disgraceful effects... that people look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to the reconstruction.
"I need to realize that the linking is still the current topic," she added, "only the police calls him."
On the other hand of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtyard, and he breaks the dinner and talks about citizens' rights.
For his own words, he has already started planning a presentation for the next year.
"The restructuring of these events is inspiring, because it describes the fear that we had to live - but it is a moment to think," he said.
"When we don't learn from that who knows... that could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the stories of their land are judged to her repeat."
I love the advantages to use.
One of my friends tells us that he's just reading the ships to use.
I don't agree, in contrast.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often risks surrealism.
With nostalgies, I'm going to take the past a long time, where the advice to use anything was more clearly.
So my first grammophone had only one paper on which there were hieroglyphes showing the involvement of parts, all were secret marks.
When I was shown that inside after years, I offered that list to Shaman who didn't be afraid to break the back board.
He advised me with a deal, what the paper with the labyrinth line is suitable.
Yeah, it's been a big help at the chronic toilet paper deployment.
He found a broad-breaker and allowed me to listen to the dear vineyards.
The new time brought new advantages.
And a relatively simple floor-scale, where the overrun grep was just held, required about ten images.
In particular, it was introduced a letter with a description of how to insert one part into the other.
The management was double and another process was simply not possible.
At the contrary, it was required of significant effort with the need for depthing of fair plastic parts.
My injury has ended with my self-moving Seat Leon mark.
The year of production 2003 was still a library with the introduction of detailed goods, including the exchange of blinker boxes.
It was easy.
Three steps, and the work should have been ready.
Unfortunately, the author of the ship mentioned that while the ship was right to change the truth only in three steps.
Section 1 of the cover.
2. Cut out the bridge of the bridge and cut the new.
Three, cut it down.
The left wallet had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At the beginning, I thought I'd put the right top of the top to our vehicle into the shopping of our driving driving, the rubbe with which it would easily cover and then I'd already drive points 1-3 of the hard author of the service book.
I think we're laughing.
The cover had no place, no room, neither for the screening hand of Popelčina, so the obedient Slezan.
I lost half a hour of my life, and it was completely without any success.
The state was still strengthened by the entrance of my wife in the garage that he called the rice and the words that from my mouth are hearing very exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she was wondering.
My answer was about 90 seconds, however, if I leave a vulgar term, it was only two publishing words.
I'm changing the wheel.
"And why does it take you so long?" she risked the one who can be her last.
I quickly explained her the problem, while I put the main point on the torture procedure of the author of the naviation, where the blessing of the spread iron on the hand, which was written, followed by her conviction that he could never write anything anymore, was the only introduction of Kladiva's wide range of instructions on the bullet, including his Commissioner's burning on the top of the hall of Losin.
"What's the way to unmount this box?" she said to the woman's output of the battery.
In pure deficiency, the step 1-3 was the same easily and → as the right side.
I thought it couldn't surprise me.
And that's the day when he called me a colleague who just came out of the colaps status after checking two officials of the State official for the treatment control.
I know her as a colleague of the balanced one who has lived in the range as possible as possible and who is able to set up wild stories with an uninterrupted voice.
"Tell me that I got a chastisement because I haven't made an advice on the mouse of my hands," he told me with a weak voice.
I gradually developed the whole problem that caused it to be that there is no pictures of the painting on the toilet on the patient's toilet.
His argument to the Commission official that he has grown up to have his hands rightly, and that it doesn't need pictograms to enable him to enable the greater activity of obedient people, had no harm and became a little money to him.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that simple flashing of the wooden waters is to receive at the level of cromanion that a modern man, Homo'ensens, is conducting this office in ten steps.
So it's necessary to notify that it's necessary to leave out of the water kitchen.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyful discovery that a man wash his hands exactly as it is designed by the Hospital from the SURL.
Finally, I have to conclude that I have been able to inspire and prepare a detailed toilet plan.
In the question of deficiency, the process is unique, there will not be a problem, in the case of power, in view of the accurate difference of both generations, that will be necessary to develop two advice.
The problem remains these pictograms, because creating a perfect procedure also means a precise degree of all anatomic details, which could build up at the internal visit of the toilet of certain battles, the fact that it can finally be learned that it has endured the appropriate opening throughout his life throughout the wrong procedure.
Pearson will leave other 3000 employees and reduce the dividend in the effort to survive business
The British Education Group Pearson on Friday stated that it would leave 3000 other employees and decrease the temporary dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme to change the business model.

On Monday he killed a suicide attacker two people near the Iraq ambassador in Kabul.
The NATO in its exhibition concluded that after the guards with the members of the Afghanistan Army were attacked “local person with a householded explosive equipment”.
The statement further states that all the harms of soldiers are beyond the threat of life and are invoked in the American military hospital to the airport base Bagram.
According to the reporter's review, the growing force of Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a significant source of the two associated forces of NATO in the nearby Bagram.

According to the rapporteurs, self-mortal attacks that he had experienced in recent weeks by the public confidence in the Government, its regulation and, in particular, in the reputation of President Asraf Ghanin.
EPA, in response to the complaint, revised its decision to determine the rules of railway
The American Vital Protection Agency rejected its decision on the derogation of Obam's law of the administration, which imposed States to reduce, and that is only the day after the agency was distorted by 15 States.
The EPA notified its decision on the ‘Ozone Standards 2015’ procedure in the middle of nightly hours, as stated that it submitted the Agency's commitment to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in the dialogue with our state partners and listen to their opinions," the EPA Director Scott Pruitt stated.
In June, Pruitt notified the EPA attempt to determine the ozone standards - which measure the air pollution in specific countries and, based on the measurement, the limits needed to be fulfilled by October 2018.
The 15th group of democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., claimed that the EPA negotiation was illegal.
The President Donalda Trumpa seeks to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by the former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in trying to buy economic growth.
However, the new government has started the anti-covering of democracy and conservative groups that are concerned about public health.
The EPA on its websites states that air breathing with the ozone content “ can reduce the flash and increase respiratory symptoms” such as astma.
The song Ladislav Bubnár got the blood and heat!
At this point, with us relatively a new song, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this song has already been an unknown song with us on the Czech Monstrous Action Conditions on which he hosted such primary personalities such as Master Karel Gott, Lucie White, Simon Krain and a number of others, and no one had any other than Leoš Mares.
It was simply to show publicity and to present his musical videoclip to the song of Sarah, whose baptized baptism was just named.
But a few people know that the single video films that were running in Russia haven't gone without problems and the only song Ladislav Bubnár had to be treated.
It was his first large attack with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it didn't go without a complete trapas.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the distressing love of two loved ones.
For the dramaticity of the scene, the songs' songs' s socks had to indicate the fax.
On one occasion, however, he struck him so strong and directly in the nose that a young song had to treat the doctors.
"I didn't expect it, immediately my blood's nose," Ladislav accommodated.
The colleagues and producers claimed that it was an emergency event and Ladislav did not come to react at time.
Happily, the hurt was not so serious to affect the continuation in the next campaign.
Now we bring you a changed video clip of the young artist, you can mention it as well as the scene with the wheel.
Unexpected blood version, but it wasn't used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaczko talked to a meeting about the options of a mutual wallet
Vasyl Lomaczko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could insinue the most pressured boxers in the light weight, first met at the street meeting.
Each of them was in the apartment room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - an unconscious shampion in a lightweight World Boxing Council - did not sit down to the hall where he welcomed the Boxer, the champion in the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcio's victory on the basis of a single decision against the former fourth world champion of Adrien Broner in the Saturday of Showtime, both boxers got to the list of five best boxers in easy weight.
Garcia attacked his chairman and said: “How's it going, champion?
Good luck."
The shipmaster is on Saturday at 19:00's Title against Miguela Marriaga at ESPN.
Boxers call for photographs and the Manager of Egis Climates adds that the potential boxer band would be a "documental test".
"I'm a former champion in the pearl weight," adds Garcia.
"For the deal with Broner (67 kg) I had to take, but I'm not so big.
I'm somewhat small at my 63 kg.
I'd like to return to the category of easy weight.
The wallet must take it back to get a light weight, then we can get out.
After that, the fan wants.
Why not fill it with them?"
The wallet agrees.
"The box would have contributed to this box."
Climates raised a request for a review payment - which is part of his strategy. The ship should resolve his debut at the end of the year, and the next year to reach Garciou (37-0.30 knockouts), which also showed interest in the victory of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who take the title in the light weight of the forum.
"The delay should be carried out by the payment for watch, they ask for fans," said Garcia, who was quite appealing that it was opened for the opportunity to exalte the charge by the television station, which will come with the best offer.
"We're the main attractions.
Nobody else will take such attention to himself.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia noted that he recognised the Lomačena as “a boxer boxer” and could participate in his Sabbath storage.
But he didn't give Garcio thanks when he said that the shampion three divisions from Riverside looks "very quietly... I'm sorry, Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show the power and then the box.
Boxers both pointed out that they felt that they were standing in front of one another.
"You will not only forget on this stock.
None of the other ships uses so much attention.
And I'm going to add to the fire with great comfort," said Garcia.
The lady said, "I was waiting for the best boxes, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great story."
A young couple of years ago, he disappeared without tracks.
Their cars are now found at the bottom of Volha.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Cherkasov have been sinned since 2005.
There were a broad-speeding after them, but without succeeding.
And the police finally ended the investigation for the lack of evidence.
The families of a lost couple lived in an uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened.
After 12 years, the whole story has been broken.
The wheel of their car found a late river at the bottom of the valley of Volha in the town of Cheboksary in Chuvash.
Only because of the documents that remained in the car, the police were able to identify a few.
The documents have survived the whole decade under water, and without them the police would continue to ensure the identity of those found.
Parer was seen in the past when Zirnov was spent his father's car to get his girlfriend out of the work.
The bathroom that the car opened remains in anonymity.
He reported his finding to the Czeboxer police, which next day the car went out on the beach.
The investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident that caused a deep road leader around the river.

The latest results of tests to determine the border of azyl request in Sweden
The latest results of azyl test tests in Sweden, which were detailed by a new method of reviewing their own, indicate that more than 80 per cent of people were questioned as 18 years older but not everyone is increasing their accuracy.
The Swedish Pharmaceutical Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started to perform new tests at the beginning of the year.
The aim of the method is to be more accurately tested in the evaluation of azyl request. The measures were attached after the Swedish Agency (Migrationsverket) were criticized for a failure to determine the correct determination of some deficiencies that lied about their own.
To this date, the Swedish Agency has submitted 6880 cases to review and the Force Agency has now published the results of 2481 tests resulted from half March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was considered as age of 18 years, while in the next 25 cases the Forenz Medical Agency claimed that the question was “possibly 18 years older”.
Other 423 cases were decided that the question was “possiblely less than 18 years”.
The tests are accessible only if the question is contrary.
According to Johana Ǵranson, the Forenz Medical Agency of Exploration corresponds to the previous month.
“In the past month, the numbers are very similar, ” he said for The Local.
More than 18 years of age, a higher number of refugees, which have been considered, does not necessarily mean that azyls are lying about their own.
In May, the Agency published an exam of 581 tests and noted that in 442 cases, “the questioned person is 18 years old or older”.
The newspapers Svenska Dagbladet studied 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases, the questionnaire indicated that it would be 18 years old.
Criticals were also expected a medical method of definition of a person that includes the rentgen of the teeth of wisdom and the MRI scan of genetic cloubs, which followed to be considered as zubs and rentgenologists.
One of the skeptics is Marcus from Karolinska Institute, which, for other things, takes care of the biodiversity of people to determine when he has passed through the pubert.
"I had to think about this problem and I don't think that these types of reaction to the testing of the resource are correct.
Assessment of biodegradation is, in certain sense, very uncertain.
If we can't determine accuracy, we shouldn't be able to retreat," he advised for the newspaper Metro.
The Foreign Medical Agency Agency's Gäransson decided: “The risk of a child's wrong examination as a adult is generally small.
The highest risk represents the fact that the questionnaire is under 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all questioned."
Trump threatened the phone of the President of Mexico.
The American President Donald Trump at the January phone of the Mexican President Enrique Peň Net acknowledged that he would not come to him if he would publicly say that his country would pay for the building of the wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump in the conversation said that financing will be arranged, even though he admitted that it would be to be guaranteed from other resources.
Through openly, Trump talked with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It comes from the reviews that the American journal The Washington Post published on Thursday.
Trump acted on the walls in the southern border for Mexico money one of the main promises in his low pre-election campaign.
In the first conversation with the Mexico president soon after the arrival to Trump Peñu Neta did not diplomaticly carry out criticism for his plan to build a wall.
The southern neighbor was a growing political problem and pressed the Mexico president so that he would not say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"That you can't say printing," repeatedly said Trump in a conversation of 27 January and threatened the interruption of contacts with the Mexico President if he continues to issue an exciting statement.
financing will also be found, and finally it will work well.
"But if you're saying that Mexico is going to pay for the wall, then I don't want to contact you, my lords, because it's inappropriate for me," said the American diary Trump.
Instead, the wall signed the less important thing we are talking about, but the political may be the most important.
Executive order for the building of the wall Trump delivered shortly after the overtake of power.
Mexican exhibition and financing of walls refuses to be 3200 km long, so both countries have also been affected.
At the end of March Trump said that the project would pay the United States yet.
Trump finally met his mexican protest first at the July Summary G20 in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also informed Thrump's phone chat with the Australian Premier Turnbulle of 28 January.
The chief of the White House of Conversation signed as a funny.
To this end, the exchange of views on the agreement that Australia provides to the Mediterranean Easts was made by the United States to accept persons from international equipment in the Pacific Islands.
Trump agreed first to be stupid, but he came to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you've created, but you'll have to keep it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passports, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jewelous, for example, when Trump assessed as a good idea of Australian refusing to accept the injuries in the articles.
"You're worse than I," threw Trump.
But now the conversation was shot.
"I hate accepting these people," said Trump.
I assure you they're wrong.
That's why they're in service now.
"They will not be great people who will work for local milk," he said.
In the discussion, he also highlighted that the spring could be an attainer from Boston in five years.
Trump conducted at the end of January, so a week after the arrival to the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world states, often and a few during one day.
The talk with Turnbulle finally signed for the least pleasant day.
Before he finished him, he highlighted that he had a pleasant conversation with the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They just fixed the killer of Rany before the date.
He also watched her father.
The correction passed in the main town of Jemen Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose a small Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi took the girl, took her father's house, where he violated her, and cut off his hands.
Soon he violated her body, and then thrown near the mixture.
The violent death of a little girl has brought the whole country to the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari standed in the first range of thousands of heads to be a witness to the correction.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was sentenced under the right of the shirt.
The father of the victims after the correction sent the media of his feelings.
I feel like a reborn.
It's up to me.
It's a new day of my life.
Even the remaining members of the family were present, together with the date they called the password "Let Justice live".
The guiltman brought a police delivery from which he was removed.
The cops put him on the boat.
One of the members against him turned his weapons, and from the unnecessary nearby, he left a blow.
The present date celebrated every one who was stuck.
Mr. al Almatari said to the MailOnline Web that justice was performed in accordance with the country's legal system.
"The righteousness, Allah, and the right of the chary have winned," added he.
I stayed in Sana's Freedom House and waited for the murder of my daughter's murder.
Then my family and I went to the season.
We took Ranina's big bottle and buried him on the nearby grave.
I and my wife, Jamileh, are thankful for being done justice.
The police feared that the damage of the injured in the place falls to hate a foolish crazy, a murder falls and disturbs.
The correction was appointed by the court under the administration of the Shuttle Huttis.
However, Maghrrabi was sentenced to 100 wounds, but his action raised such a rebellion that the judge decided for death.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on 27 June.
The early family knew him well.
When the police was looking for his house, she discovered the evidence of his husband's planning.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creation.
What could be his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to the Rain.
"Our family has no enemies and the hurt that took Ranino's body was terrible," said the media.
"Rana disappeared on the afternoon, on the other day we reported it to the police, we told it to the newspapers and all our television stations, the plates with her worms everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks that the police got a guy from the murderers who understood their son from a terrible act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to have been hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body was found.
The morning was going to play out with the last kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where it was.
We've been looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took the cars and walked around, but we looked badly.
The Jemen's people were lost by crime and began to shame before the police station where al Maghrabi was held and requested a immediate offence.
The Representative of the Ministry of Justice has read the present duty of the investigation record to quiet them.
The accused man did not show compassion for his deeds.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police read him the judgment, but the sentence was just looking at his recruit.
The entire event was indicated for national television, but on the Internet there were many records that he ordered.
The Governor of Western Virginia announced the change of the political party
The Democratic Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday at the meeting of President Trumpa that he went to another side.
"If you like it or not, the democracy turned back to me," said Justice.
"Today, after long prayer and thinking, I announce you as a western Virginia people today, I tell you that I can't continue to support you from the democracy position."
The attack of the observers exploded in joy.
"I'll notify the Republicans tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer I can tell you, it's time to go into another ship."
Trump has already promised a significant notification to people in Western Virginia.
Trump wined in Western Virginia 42 points and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate from Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which was selected by the only billion in the country, according to the journal Forbes, was selected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice has inherited his father's great possession and is the owner of some corners down.
The value of his property is estimated to $1,59 billion.
The Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, in which it stated: "The Promotion of Justice is the next tomorrow for the Democratic Party, which puts us in the road, rather than to contribute to the introduction of our country."
"For a democracy party which is available only for 15 and manages at least legal authorities in the history, the statement of the Justice is the latest head for the already so deceived party without a leader who is deeply trying to find the position and the association of reports," reported President RNC Ron McDaniel in its declaration for the CBS News.
Sebastian Coe appreciates the " sincere" excuse of Russia for the scandal
The former exciting sportsman Sebastian Coe appreciated Russia on Thursday for a sincere excuse for the scandal, but again repeated that there was no right time to return Russia to the sports world.
The leader of the Russian athletic Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the opportunity of the IAAF congress - which was held in the previous evening of MS in the atlet - that the exemption of his country from the world of sport was right and that it was decided to fight against the injury.
He was excused “to all the atlets that so came about gold and silver medals”.
Despite its comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted for the preservation of the prohibition in force in November 2015 after the World Antido Agency's reports showed that Russia supported its sporters.
"I think we were witnesses today very sincere answers and presentations," President IAAF Sebastian Coe said to the journalists.
"All members of the Council and the Congress were pleased to be surprised that Russia had admitted its error and worked out of all forces to prepare and renew the right of the entire Federation."
Coe said he was also “comfortable” that Russia adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think he has been very dealing today and we have made a further degree, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the Crises Chamber on the maintaining of the offence to Russia," added Coe.
“In the nearest months, we have to do everything for it, and we have stabilised the stability.
Our effort was to separate honest athletes from those who do not worship," he ended his word.
On MS in the athlete starting on Friday in London, 19 Russian atlets will be competited under the neutral flash of 19 Russian athletes that have fulfilled the urgent rules of IAAF.
Chief of the IAF crisis number on Monday said that Russia must still comply with a few criteria before it is allowed back.
The tests of the presence of drugs are still unexpected and the trainers continue to operate their activities, said to the reporters in London after the IAAF Council has been presented.
The State prohibition of CzechTrade has received the company Františka Savova, whose state is slow.
The public prohibition of the State export agency CzechTrade has received the issuer of the Young front of Františka Savova.
The officers gave him a hundred percent of points in all quality criteria.
They didn't be sure that the Czech state was to be able to take Savov for tax subways and requested his release to Czechland.
The export Agency of the Ministry of Industrie and Commercial CzechTrade issued a public prohibition in April for the four-year assurance of the editorial area for BusinessInfo portal.
The prohibition of 30.8 million crowns has obtained the delivery of the Youth Front of Františka Savov.
However, the Czech police committed the tax in 2014 and fled to flee.
Saw moved to Great Britain and Czechland requested his release.
For the case, the server warned Currently.cz.
In order to grant a prohibition, according to the P criteria of the CzechTrade, the 60 per cent of the proposed price and the remaining 40 concurrents of niceness, therefore the quality of the project.
In fact, Savov’s company was explicitly helped by the second criteria.
According to the information, Dotyk.cz received the quality of hundred points in all part criteria.
It just moved it before another candidate, the release of Vltava Labe Media VLM, which then offered a better price.
While the young front operated with 404 900 corners per month, VLM offered 324 350 corners.
In the section of the Youth front, however, the average assessment has been obtained from the reviewers in all quality criteria, totally 62 points.
The tender has continued to participate in the constant BDO Advis and the digital R-Media Agency, which falls as a server Currently.cz under Economy issue.
The VLM issued a number of comments against the tender analysis that its evaluation considers the nza inadequate and inadequately delayed.
After their refusal, a concurrence was determined to be attacked by the Office for the Protection of the Economic Concurrence of the OECD.
It seems that the CzechTrade acted in conflict with the law.
"The employer is convinced that the employer has received the decision to choose the supplier of a public prohibition on the basis of the risk of an entity assessment, a uniquely favouring young frontier, etc., to the task of the employer and other suppliers," it is written in the context of the start of the management given on the UOHS this week that has published the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and President-General of the VLM Michala Climy, the voting committee appears to be an incredible and gradual evaluation of the Youth front project in all its members as an extraordinaryly suspicious.
"Each independent observer must consider such a wonderful success of one of the concurrents as an insufficient and suspicious," he said for the Current Clima.
CzechTrade hasn't yet been able to make sure.
The CzechTrade Agency primarily announces public prohibitions before closing them.
All information about you are published in accordance with the law of the employer's Profile and the Public Prohibitor.
"When the prohibition is finished, the full written message will be published, but during the duration of the prohibition we can't expose to its progress," said the Medical Representative of the Agency Stepán Long.
A young front reacted to the statement, which considers extraordinaryly difficult that the Economy's issuers were involved in the articles in Currently.cz in concurrence with its own business interests.
However, this qualification was mentioned in the said article.
In the trend, she could help her that she just provided the BusinessInfo editorial service in the previous four years.
The prohibition was first enforced in 2013 when the Ministry of Industrie and Trade conducted Marti Kuba ODS.
Franciska Savova wins the police from tax injuries in relation to the over-direct DPH counts by its fire, which caused the Czech State a data damage to 770 million crowns.
Czech Republic requests its issue since 2014.
According to Savova, his criminalization boss of the United Nations Andrej Babiš, under which the Mafra issuer is affected.
The London Court of Justice of Savovo's rejected the issue, but the businessman refused.
"From our view, the case has not been moved to anywhere, we from the Great Britain have not yet received any understanding for the currently.ch speaker of the Prague State Representative of the Zenk Zenk.
In addition to the property of the Youth fronts, Savov in Harvestor Limited was seated in Cyprus, who managed the Czech Republic of Samson, and in the Cyprus company of Maraflex, which is profiled as a investment fund, buying a threatened activity.
The control would also have the Heavy Machinery Services firm, before Legios, which deserves over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also connected with the exemption of the property from some social union of the youth.
The engine was walking after the grades and the park, and ended in the rocks.
The engine surrounded his attention in the streets, roads and park roads in Ushovica.
When the guard started tracking him, he decided to catch her in the direction of the Station.
"Politic men with highly cared followed the city when on one of the nearest trips after the Marian Lazars, he didn't be able to handle and with a motocycle went into the field where he had a havary," introduced the police speaker Daniel Dvořák.
Finally, he had to flee to a salvator who was transported by a vulnerable engineer to the pulmonary disease.
Following the police, the engine has proved that the non-essential driver's demonstration, the motorcycle registration marks were cut off, its production number was cut off and removed by the single production box.
It's so likely that the machine was stolen.
The motorcycle is the subject of another investigation.
"The breach test was thrown in the place of alcohol in the driver, but the test was discovered to positive the outcome of the metamphetamine substance," added the police speaker.
How the financial rules of the Balon or move Neymara to Paris
The rules limiting the financing of European Baltic Clubs do not violate Neymar's record transition from Spanish Barcelone to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalisation for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by EUFA organizations, watching the European Balls Teams and having the right to prohibit the teams of the pressure Lisa of the Masters.
The financial fair play (FFP) rules introduced by EUFA in 2011 indicate that PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymar’s transition was not financed without great loss.
Barcelona only payed $222 million for buying Neymara from its s~a and Neymar will request payment in over $10 million per year.
It follows a few financial submissions of Neymar's transition to France.
Since the PSG team is financed by a rich cartridge family that has riched energy sales, it may allow Neymara to bring to such a star-bal family.
Clubs can be lost for the purchase of a major amount of players, but, on the other hand, they must show legal resources of income, which allows them to cover the regular costs of business activities related to the ball.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the chair of the EUFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that are debt for new posts, finally doubled and risked bankrots if banks or owners are refusing to ensure.
In 2011, the FFP rules had its attention from club debts to monitoring their loss.
This change indicated that the business model used by Roman Abramovič with Chelsea in 2003 - buying the potential club and losing the current amounts for y players to build a global mark - immediately it was not so valuable.
During the current three-year trial period that ends in 2018, the clubs may lose up to EUR 30 million.
And despite that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his representative Alexander Cheferin is determined to deal with the prohibition of excessive losses.
"The FFP's rights are still payable and we are decided to strengthen it in the future," he introduced last week for Press Andrea Traverso, watching the compliance with FFP rules.
Although the PSG has empowered the amount of the Neymara purchase in a single payment, it can be determined to the total duration of the duration of the PSG.
Neymar signed five years of age, so the translation could be described to EUR 44.4 million each year for five years.
In 2014, the PSG with Manchester City, which is the own group of Abu Dhabi.
The PSG has taken a decrease of EUR 60 million (82 million dollars) - which was lately reduced to EUR 20 million - and the order to reduce the Ligy of Masters to 21 players in 2014-2015, instead of 25 players.
The EUFA focuses on teams that can be tried to deal with financial regulators by providing their income by the company associated with the owner of clubs.
Thus, even if the cardiac company sponsors the PSG as the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rates, EUFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amounts.
In 2014, the EUFA adopted a similar measures, after decided that the above financial stakeholders provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team were too high.
The part of Neymar receipts in PSG could be arrested by the Organizational Commission of MS in Catalue 2022.
PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Katar, however, claimed that Neymat should be an ambassador of MS in Baal and that the UEFY factors would easily discover.
Previous sanctions imposed on the PSG means that EUFA will carefully monitor any trial for regulations,
The EUFA has not initiated any investigation in the case of Neymara's transition to PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous, since the PSG not authorised to comment, introduced the Agency.
The last published annual conclusions show that the PSG has closed the year 2015-2016, with a clean winning of EUR 10 million and EUR 542,4 million.
The relevant conclusions for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a great opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling dress.
The Club's signature promises to increase the turn to 30 percent.
The representatives of the Spanish League, obviously concerned about the department of one of the largest stars, tried to disturb Neymar's department, argumenting that PSG would violate FFP rules.
“It is the case of the ‘financial to` club and the State’,” the President la Ligy Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the property of the PSG Club with the patriarch syndic.
Arsenal Arsene Wenger manager, whose own American sport club is magnate, shares the same position of La Ligy on the financing of the club.
"It's a follower of the property that has changed the Ballow World in the last 15 years," Wenger's hearing on Thursday.
“When the owner of the club happens, it is possible.
Keeping the financial fair play rules is very difficult because the state may have different interests in players in their club."
The Spanish founder Russian: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Seventeen thousand applauding fans on the feet.
Tomas russian is going to the place.
It's the same scene as in the Sunday fight against Bohemians.
The Spanish founder moved against the Red Star, invented a few of them, but his partners did not go into black.
The aircraft team with new multimillion pools, so after the introductional doubles in Europe's arms, ends.
Was it hard to do something else after the Belarus County?
After incased, four were needed to shoot, which was hard for us.
We wanted at least not to lose, get up with self-consciousness, and we had to turn from what to do with other resources.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why was Sparta not able to get so in the ship?
The game is terriblely designed.
Combinations of competition were much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we could have shot for a half time.
Of course, it's a little bit when you have to win two or three.
The second half time was a lot better, in the final third, we had been able to play with them.
But you've got to get more often into such positions.
Is the problem a big number of changes in the composition?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new man is created.
We played only three competitive stocks and the composition still changes.
It's about the trainer to find an ideal eleven who's sitting.
Is it an encouragement for you that you've already played a part of two backs after you?
It's still only parts of the floor.
I don't know how my status will be developed and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have occurred in Sparta?
We have to be, Otherwise it doesn't happen.
It's the same thing with hurt.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta has decided, we must be optimistic, Otherwise it will be worse.
The fans returned to a large number, but they went away in disappointments.
What can you tell them?
There was a visit again, just as with God.
He hates me terriblely that we can't make them happy with a better effect.
Take something to come for the next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can the season be without fires at least the benefit of the liver?
So we fight ourselves, we strive, so that's not the benefit for us.
For the extreme tax income, the employee has been sitting for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of Jiří Toman's employee, who has a significant extent to repeal ten years of service.
The calculated damage makes 645 million crowns.
Toman claimed that justice violated its basic rights, the real discovery of judgments in the Life and the Olumucies is probably incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Courts recognized the complaint as an inadmissible, tried the CCT from the Court database.
US is not another revocation court.
"It can not be considered as a fourth instance the facts or legal doubts that the general courts have been given, if they do not constitute a violation of the rights and freedoms constituted," it is stated in the resolution.
Toman was judged as an arrogant.
Verdict is authorised since November 2015, when the Supreme Court confirmed it in Olomouca.
At that time, Toman was in the issued liaison in Argentina, where he was adopted in accordance with the resolution, and at the time of the US decision.
The recorded penalty is at the top of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the emergency damage.
The Supreme Court referred to as an extraordinary tax income which has an economic impact on the State budget.
The husband acted as the President of the World Service company in 2005 to 2008.
The damage of 645 million crowns came only for the period from January to July 2008, the total income according to the scientist exceeded billion.
However, in processing cases, Toman was not able to judge the whole amount.
According to the complaint of World Services, the company did not include its tax recognition of all factures.
Instead of monthly DPH and the needed tax in rows, at least ten million crowns payed tax in only statistics.
World Services and some companies with which the company was negotiated have a relationship with Radimir Electoral Company, whose justice has been awarded for the DPH machinery in trades with 13 years of age.
He also rejected his complaint before the time of the Constitutional Court.
The series “And for Success” and “Comrade Detectives” are playing on nostalgic stream
This story is nostalgic as well as for the stations of the 80 ’ s celebration; so for the 90 ’ s (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced to the MTV comedial scratch “The State”; and, of course, for the modern time, specifically in 2001, before stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd were addressed to more projects.
As a cultural artefact, it is a easy parodia, and it is also the deal of our modern facebook's ears of sustainable ears.
But it seems to be a breathe to somebody.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only thanks to the absurd humor (e.g. the story of the talking holiday with the green that H. Jon Benjamin said).
The authors were removed from the main amazing points - the hearts of the center, playing adults holding children - and couldn't be taken away from the previous events.
Continuing the "Ten Years Later", in which adults play not so much for emotional levels and satira is places to radical, possibly parodies on the thirillery of 90 years as "The hands on the collection".
At one moment, the station will be found on the Apple Powerbook Haraburd's hole, the cocktail brusle and the "country of other things from 1991".
Many main history lines are repeated.
Well-hearted Coop (pan Showalter), now the writer, has not yet been transferred through his love to Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panic.
It is not talking about a foolish applet that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is invoked by George H. W. Bush (very well involved Michael Ian Black).
As -- they are the best part of the French people of many neighborhood stories.
Especially fun is to follow young Rudda with long hair alias Matt Dillon from the young film, whose respectful position of Andy is now for a old paprice.
Francis may start the moments of adequate crazy, as it may be to return the series “Seven Up” until it reaches what I assume will be logical discovery: “Weet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later”, when the whole group is released in the last scene to the Premier’s Year to not survive.
"Comrade Detectives" at Amazona calls for another type of nostalgie: revivalism of the study war of the series "Takovi Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blondes: Without acknowledge" and even the series "GLOWs", in which the icons of the east and west west west-screen are drawn up.
Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka, in Rhyse Thomase, have to act as a television inscension: a drama of two bucurest police from Romania in the 80th century that fight for truth and attitude in the way of marxis-leninism.
Hla’s role - Gregor's anxiety and the idealist Joseph - play Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Streets, who bought in the English language Channing Tatum (executed manufacturer of series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an awful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not even much more.
In some tips, you're laughing (as needed by the cops who follow the television shoes - parodie to the American ball).
The series has proclaimed his voice to many known herds - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
"Comrade Detective" is too focused on an insufficient propaganda drama - which also includes a killer with the Reagan mask - and it also looks like that.
Six long episodes are too divorced and comedial moments not enough.
At the shorter stage, the propagandist satira could work in the Comrade Detective, for example in the scene when Gregor and Josef again visit the Velvyslanicity of the United States, in which two tissues are throwing hamburgery on a large hole.
The clear message for imaginary communists is that western culture can change everything into wave and orgy.
The thoughts of the Roman creators did not fail: we do so with our own culture, as with them.
The Russian athletes were not expected to cancel the IAAF starting prohibition.
The International Athletic Federation of IAAF at the Conference in London confirmed the prolongation of the international prohibition of Russian leaders' starting for the State supported in the programme.
The vote in the World Championate, which begins on Friday, has occurred very uniquely, according to the expectation.
166 delegates were expressed in order to extend the prohibition, but only 21 votes were voted.
It is in particular that Russia is not able to comply with all requirements for the introduction of an antidosystem, as the Chairman of the IAAF’s special investigation group was established before the Congress.
His group recommended that the prohibition continues.
Some elders in the area remain unresolved, a number of suspicious atlets have not yet been heard and trainers still work in the country with a disappointed story.
Not even the Russian antido agency RUSADA that does not comply with World Antido Agency's standards.
RUSADA can, however, conduct tests under supervision of experts and the British Antido Agency.
"Although it has come to progress, it is still necessary to do a lot of work," President IAF Sebastian Coe said.
Russian Atletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, Russian atlets came outside the low olympical games in Riu de Janeiro.
By the prohibition of attending MS, 19 Russian participants, who earlier showed that they had been tested a longer time outside the Russian antido system.

The Bank of England should, as expected, notify that the rates rate will remain unchanged, following an unexpected economic growth and weakness of inflation, which has contributed to the speculation of equivalent growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be "forward" in relation to the loss of rate - despite the demand of family budgets.
The Policy factors of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Angle Banks voted six to two for the preservation of the rates of 0.25 %. The results of voting for increase in the rates supported an unexpected economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual report on bankinflation, the bank had a growth of 1,7 % in 2017 and 1,6 % in 2018 and warned that the reduction of family budgets would continue. The bank expects that inflation grows up to 3 %.
The Bank also pointed out that during the next years, the inflation caused by Brexit should be increased and also indicated that the mobility of the financial markets should grow more than expected.
The members of the Committee also voted for the establishment of the part of the packaging of the mother whose task was to support the economy, which was introduced to the practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
In the outcome of the above, it should be started to pay the plan for the terminated financing, which will offer a loan to banks, although the Bank of England stated that the salaries planned by 115 billion £ would now offer 15 billion £ less.
Just before the Bank's decision, “MPC predicts that a brutal home product (HDP) will shortly be stagnated together with pressure on real household income and disturbance.”
At the same time, the bank stated that it would be necessary to “taste the money policy” to deteriorate inflation, which is“in higher way” than the markets expected.
The markets currently predict the first growth in the third quarter of the next year and the next growth in 2020.
However, the Bank highlighted that any growth would be "autorised" and "limited".
The Bank reduced the growth preliminary for the year and the next year in comparison with 1,9 % and 1,7 % of the preliminary in May.
The estimated growth in 2018 remained unchanged by 1,8 %.
After the publication of the reviews, the library was cut off against the dollar and the euro.
Library decreases 0.5 % in 1.31 dollars and 0.4 % in 1.11 euros.
The decision on the maintenance of the existing state came after the devastating growth had been buried for further growth - the HDP stopped by 0.3 % in the second quarter of the previous three months.
The growth with great probability remains to 0.3 % in the third quarter, although until the end of the year, the bank should be quite increased.
The latest inflation report is an intimate comfort for household inflation and mixture increasing payments.
The report further states that the monetary policy is not able to protect the reduction of income in the nearest years, but it is expected to be “expectedly” to the end of the three-year prognoses.
The economy should also increase thanks to the great interest of the British goods thanks to the weak liver, which complicates lower percentage of consumption expenditure.
This Decision comes to the year after the last year in August, the rates were reduced to 0,025 % in response to the shocking vote on the EU reference, which caused a decrease.
The Bank considers that the total unit of prices and economics takes at least four years.
Before the decision of the Bank on the latest rates, many have requested the growth of rates together with growing inflation, which has developed more pressure on homelife, and three political factors have requested to increase in June to 0,5 %.
The inflation returned to 2,6 % of June 2,9 %, even though the bank noted that such change was expected and that the inflation should be replaced during the next month.
The Bank noted that the oversight of the objective relative to 2 % was “very” in the case of weakness.
Andrew Montlake, director Coreco Mortgage Brokers, stated: “With a recent fall of swaps, it seems that competition on the hypothetic market will only stand as the trusters will continue to support prohibitions in view of a good view at the end of the year.
It seems particularly good for those who end existing compounds and repeated hypotheches - in the offer there are options without payments, as the low rates that will get on the face."
NHS pre-describes HIV-controversial treatment in 10 000 patients
Patients are obtained from severe access to ‘transformation’ treatment to prevent HIV based on the decision of the Supreme Court of Financing of NHS.
The National Health Service (NSH) reported that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high risk patients to 86 per cent will be offered by health service for approximately 10 000 patients in a three-year trial trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the experimental period after the revocation court supported the decision of the Supreme Court of the Latest Year with a view to the fact that the NHS had financial provisions for the replacement of the PEP, despite the statement that the medicinal product should be financed by the local authorities.
The decision notified on Thursday adopted the NHS England from the oom of the Director-General Simon Stevense as a ‘significant intervention’ while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as ‘decisive moment’.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first ones that will start accepting patients. Other clinics will be connected in October and will reach complete implementation throughout England until April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
The tests showed that the PEP reduces the risk of HIV transfer among threatened patients.
PrEP before sex means that there is sufficient quantity of specific medicines in the body of the patient to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
The tested patients belong to homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV-related partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics specify reasonable responsibilities that sign the consensus of testing, including men, women, transsexual people and partners whose status of HIV has not yet been controlled by relevant treatment.
People who live and register GP in Great Britain can also be registered in their local clinic of sexual health and care for potential testing.
The programme will come to tax payers for 10 million £ and NHS England signed this week with the distribution of medicines after the international public prohibition.
The experimental period is proposed to conserve clinical evidence and test the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation in a large measure.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should be supplemented and increasingly enlarged and more successful attempts to prevent HIV.
It's another milk in more than thirty years, who's trying to stop one of the greatest challenges of human health."
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: ‘We are witnesses of a decisioning moment in combating HIV.
If PEP is given correctly and to patients in danger, it will offer the possibility of HIV epidemic change.
The NSH is offered to patients with high risk of HIV infection, a new potential tool that is individually controlled and is unnecessary to treat a partner, which will lead to improve the quality of many lives.
We accept this declaration with rejoicing."
Ian Green, Executive Director Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The first number of one must be the testing set in the whole country; we must ensure that it is available to each patient.
Now we have a PEP experimental medicine and we are on a good way to protect more than 10 000 people that threaten the risk of HIV injury."
Sharon Hodgson’s health ministerial stated: ‘The beginning of the experimental period of PrEP is a welcome and expected change after months of relief and maintenance from the Government.
The evidence indicates how transformable this medicine can be as part of our access to prevent HIV and the end of transmission of this life threatening infection.
The following tests will lead us to a step close to the full understanding of the benefits of the PrEP.
Now it's important, and the tests started at first throughout the country and protected those who have been established by HIV and have completed HIV broadcasts in the company together."
Life on high legs: interpatro and smart design changed this small apartment to Earls Court in the Room House
Joanne Leigh, an ex-country banknote for invisibles, changed a large house in Knightsbri's in 2014 for the apartment of Earls Cour.
It is found in the first watch of the wise Queen Anne terases - and is an illustration of the modern design that uses the maximum space available.
"I lived with my ex-married in a lot more home in Knightsbri's fourth," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something more understandable.
I hit this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height of the street.
I'm just loved and I'm on the same day."
Since that time, the apartment has passed by 1000 meters of a quarter complete renewal.
A single apartment with a complicated extension - to get into the bed, you have to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add apartment rooms and interpatro to use a high-scale.
“I was used by a high spring, large windows, and many lights.
That was my requests," she said.
After that, Erfan Azadi was employed from the Duck & Shed's architectural and design study and was sitting in Notting Hill and used at least four meters of a stage to create a house that was not only a project but also a place for life.
Strop has not reached the height of two areas - the challenge of the prospectives was to create an interpatch on which it would be possible to walk uprightly.
Erfan had to take care of his creatival thoughts.
“The destination is increasingly complicated,” he explained.
"We both had to arrange the Chambers so, and we could walk uprightly.
It was not just to set a simple platform, but to burn the ocean in order to make the right height above and under the stream."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to build two full-valuable rooms - and to add to dramaticity.
In interview, he looks at a beautiful living room of old meat windows in the Retrovuius design.
Scarlet apartment in gold, silver lines and back luster Serge Mo Vy creates a single.
The use of the jarcadel plays a significant role in dramaticity, room and lighting.
The short road is watched by both sides and seems so longer.
It looks like a window in the next room.
At the doors of the entrance, the storage rooms are locked to fit the vessels and glasses.
The advantage of the residence room, which provides to the whole apartment the idea of a higher space, is the opportunity to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The big kitchens are not new.
However, what is unique to this solution is the key door.
"We had to solve the technical page," Erfan talks about the diluted dry doors.
“The animals are preserved by anticipation to be very easily separated.”
Thanks to the nice use of the room and storage rooms, Joanne gained more than 16 meters of quarter, second room and better total division of the apartment.
"When it comes to it, what you sell is a habitual desktop - or assessing your own own," Erfan said.
"The realist shall calculate its price on the basis of the residential table when the income into the apartment."
In this case, it was possible to increase the habitat area in the maintenance of quality materials that promote the House's luxury view.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create a emotional way with home," added Erfan.
“You don’t love electric divorce in walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts will not get."
As shown, the quality design and the increase of the habitat room can change the normal apartment to an exceptional work.
And as Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States are divorced.
Cultural and political disasters between the black and red states are covered.
California has announced the prohibition of its citizens to Tennessee and other seven countries.
The state of Tennessee has paid her and announced an advocate prohibition of traveling her citizens to California.
Of course, there is no prohibition in full meaning that the US citizens can travel freely after all fifty States.
It is that California has prohibited State money on the ways of its citizens in eight other states with Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kenttica, Mississippi, North Caroline, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop that crazy?
California is strong for LGBT and any evidence of unconformity with the life-member LGBT considers discrimination.
Tennessee, however, adopted the law on the exemption of a knowledge that requires a psychotherapeuth, which has a moral problem with the treatment of patients with LGBT community, has no obligation to provide it to them, but the obligation for those patients is to ensure a different therapy that does not have such a problem.
Texas and other States have again adopted the laws under which the religious charitable organizations received from their mother after birth to adoption do not have the obligation of these children to give adoptions equally to couples.
For the purposes of these laws, California prohibited the financing of its citizens' roads to eight States of the Union from its own staff.
In practice, it means that Californian professors should not have a way to a deep symposium, for example, in Texas, payed by their universities because they are co-financed by the State of California.
For example, school sports, teams cannot travel to tours or competition to Tennessee with financial support for their schools.
They have to get a federal grant on the road, but it is absurd that the Federal Government finances the paths of citizens from State A to State B or a private sponsoring.
The state of Tennessee has come to patience and his Parliament has adopted the law with a resolution that it also does not like the California policy of high taxes, high state expenditures, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but it does not affect California because of that way.
It seems to be a carrying for the Californian Travel Ambassador to Tennessee.
The same happens to each Union State, which would order a traveling prohibition to another State from any debt.
He called the parliaments of all States to stop this foolishness.
That's the fact, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constituent, nothing is anticonceptive.
States have the right to adopt the laws of the exemption of the knowledge, and to decide what their money will go and what they do not need.
For the other, what's wrong in the extent of a conscience?
If a divorce has a religious problem to sell winters, why could he not offer only birds, cattle, and fish?
Why is it possible to sell him as well as the wheat when the wheelers offered are enough?
In Colorado State, one pekare denied the anti-discrimination complaint and high temptation because he refused to deal with homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to do the holidays to Halloween or the alcohol containing.
Why don't you treat him and not leave him in the room and the responsibility to not deal with the hundreds of remaining pearls?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constituent rights of all citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual States may be able to adjust the internal, domestic policy in the rights of non-federal rights, such as the preferences of their people.
Then there is diversity, diversity, divergence.
California may be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California!
For the fourth, the members of the LGBT communities at the time have attempted to have a tolerance to their lives.
Today, many members of this community are guided by the rule of living and to live in which all understanding people should be conducted, but some activists are never trying to tolerance against themselves and the final, but to extreme neutrality towards others.
For them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical failure with the LGBT Life Member, and if so, it must be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They're new enemies of freedom.
For the fifth, I don't know the American history when the states have been accepted by political issues, other than the only case.
Even during the civil rights of black, where North and West were on the side of integration and Jih on the side of the segregation, the states did not have sanctions on themselves.
That was the only case in the 19th century, the political cousin was slavery and went to the war of North against Jihu.
Of course, there's nothing like this now, but ́s toxic.
Cultural and political disasters between the white democratic and the red Republic states are disrupted and the United States are mentally spread.
Not allowed agitacy.
Putina's criticism has received a mast pain.
The Russian Opposition Policy Alexej Navalney has received 300 thousand rubbles for the violation of the rules of the campaign before the presidential elections, which will be the next year.
The Court sent him repentance because he urged people to be incompatible with unleavened demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny organized two large anti-governmental protests and noticed that in March the next year he wanted to take care of the head of the State.
The Officer Chef of Kreml Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidate, but it is generally expected that this work will win and again.
Navalny said that the police came home to him and brought him to the court.
This repentance made him because he invited people to demonstrate videos located on the YouTube Internet port.
It's three hundred thousand.
"We're throwing them out of the payment of the judge," he's murdered on the cross criticism of the twitter.
The Russian electoral Commission has recently concluded that Navalny’s electoral elections could not be able to be made because he was previously accused of the conviction.
The Navalny, which is considered as a fight against corruption, is, however, the appropriate judgment is politically motivated.
It also placed two members of the Naval Preference Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalney entered Russian policy as an anti-coruption blogger and gradually became dominant persons on the opposite scene.
The offices are trying to protect Navalne in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to the five-year subsequent sentence because he stole the forest firm Kirovles.
In May, the verdict confirmed the revocation court.
The judgment is so powerful that Naval, according to the Russian laws, prevents the candidate.
Brothers fight for empire in value over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the impery of their Italian family, take over one of the lovers of the victorian potential of over 500 million dollars.
Ancient director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives on the dominion of Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has discovered the common property and business in charge to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business already in 2014, but the easier dispute is continually spread before the highest court.
Along with Anna his mother, a total of 38 billion brothers in a value of more than half billion dollars. In 1973, she bought a family at the street in Collingwood.
Westco Jeans, who has grown up in the road with 160 stone trades.
In 1999, the family sold the whole company in total for 85 million dollars.
For money they have purchased other unabilities and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, building areas in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and business centres.
Paul owns approximately one third of the active company, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul's words, is “a significant force and dominant personality” of the family De Lutis, owned in total two thirds of actives.
The Courts state that Colin is a 316 million dollar's own immunity, while Paul's manager for $176 million.
For Paul, the problem was just to divide property and financial cups.
“Colin’s advice expressly expressed in my eyes in his benefits” wrote Paul in a local statement at the court in 2015.
Last Wednesday, after some unfortunate trials of peace, the first meeting of the Supreme Court.
Brothers now also support who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his exhibition, rejected Colin.
Colin resists that it's not the truth and accuses Paul of mistakes with some weaknesses.
In the previous local-representative statement, Colin stated that she would make a solution to the conflict.
"My Italian pû dictators me that the family is most important," he wrote.
The costs for the courts are delayed. Hundreds of pages of local statements, emails and messages from the company, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck.
Mrs. De Lutis and her delicate wife, Luigi, were Italian attendants, who operated milk bars and lakes since the 1950 ’ s, and in the 70 ’ s, buyed a building in Brunswick.
For money obtained by the delay of the property, they bought a freedom in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he put Westco "in the last year of high school, Paul was still a little, about 10-year-old boy."
● De Lutis noted that with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the translation of property to sons would be successful.
"Lugi often said that he never wanted his sons to end in the court," she wrote.
Other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the group of the family company De Lutis. Colin noticed that Mark was charged by 10 million dollars and Luke was $26 million.
As Paul, Luke and Mark said, “they were not associated with the subminans of their financial damage”.
Colin has been held from that time, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL Club's representation, as he introduced in his autobiograph of 2015, Eddie McGuire, known TV personality and best friend Colina.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutisovy and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered only Colin with the text message, in which he indicated that because the dispute is resolved before the court, “I'm not going to add”.
"It is very proud that my brother Paul decided to resolve the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, in one of the statements of the Court Colin stated that he was trying to adapt his brother's requests.
“Our father would be very uncomfortable if he had seen our presentation, ” he allowed him to hear and added to “continue to hope in an earlier solution”.
On Friday, all of them were in independence.
“Our disputes will resolve the courts at fast time,” Colin wrote.

In the school, there is an open core where the temperature seems to be moved about 40 degrees.

Teachers and children are trying to go to the boss where the youngest boy is.
The child's worrying bottles and the program has different water games.
"We've got a hand pressure-processor that is used for flowers, and we're using it for kidnapping," said Compan.
The director of the mother school at the Novoborska Street on the Prague Prosecu Jitka Vilimovska also said that the factors of children are trying to keep them in the shadow and get them with water.
"We have a relatively growth of garden, so they're under the trees," she said.

Every child must have a head cover.
Teachers also believe that they should drink.
For example, they can choose a little sweet tea or red jazz and have a drink with water in the garden.

Trump's new chief boss plans to limit the president's media diet
Many tried it before him and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do that.
Yeah, it'll be the first one.
The Portal Politico noted that the new chief of the white House plans to limit the information of President Trumpa - mostly reporters in television reports - in a view that it will maintain Trumpa at the level.
This is part of the reporter Joshe Dawsie:
“When the new chief of the White House John F. Kelly meetings the first day of the new worker with the employee, the key problem of Trump's White House, which decides to: wrong information that is available to the President in the hand.
Kelly announced the employees that he must approve all the information - either on a paper or a speaking word - because the President can be decided better on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors on the control of Trump and his presentation in the media broke their teeth.
Trump's relationship with the media is given a few decades back - and now, when he sits in the White House, his habit to watch the television messages is even stronger.
“When Trump was a candidate to be disrupted by honest reporters, it was appropriate to show him that he speaks about it in a positive light with other media that was easier to convince," he introduced in the February for Politico Sam Nunberg, an ex-campagne adviser.
Tara Palmeri, from the Portal of Politico, then wrote that “with the key to killing Trump tweets on the wall - at least according to the words of the six former organizers of his campaign - it is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that can be praised.”
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish its views on Twitter was when it was "under control", it was funny.
Maybe these campaign organisations know something that the finals don't know -- that the Trumpo's twoty would be more nervous if anyone did not control them.
The two things Trump never sent out, we will never know with great probability.
His employees were able to keep him at least some times on the top, and their effort did not come out in the morning.
Nevertheless, no one could regularly defend the Tromps to support the controversial subjects.
A part of this problem is that in the White House, which is combined with the associated groups, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by providing Trumpo's materials - which they can, but do not need to be eligible - which support their views on the world.
The Political Portal, which covered the problem from all parties, published in May the report on the advisers' advice to submit doubtful information to the head of the State.
This is an example of such information from the pera reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“The current and former officials of Trumpa claim that the President often reacts very irrelevantly to the media negative reports, especially to the reports on the outcome of information, and seeks to find them.
At the end of February, when someone supported the president copy of the article from GotNews.com - the web pages of the operator Charles C. Johnson - who accused the representatives of the Chef of Katie Wals' headquarters because it was the source of a lot of information from the White House.
Notwithstanding that Johnson was always acquired of Twitter for complaints; or that his claim has not submitted any evidence; or that he has already published false accusations and has rejected them in the past.
Trump read the article and started to ask Wals."
Goldmacher added that then the head of the Rince Priebus and the secretary of the White House Rob Porter “successful to implement the system for the management and documentation of the information that President Trump will receive”.
Would that work?
Kelly's now, in three months, trying to implement the same strategy.
It may be shown that he is a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness is just not so, and his assistants still support the power.
These incredible factors of Kelly's mission are absolutely difficult.
Tourist negotiation on the refund and return to the ‘Millionary Quarter’
A few of the most potential owners of the house in the West Midland village is again running over with decided tourists who are negotiating with local offices on the right to recover the field for their seats.
The tourists parked 20 caravans on the field at the flooding street in Solihull, which is overcoming the "millionary quarter".
By bringing the horses, children and army of the karavans, the tourists returned after they were made in May. They did not recover the cup that was buried on the basis of the regulation of the offices to protect them in the place.
The takt group found the areas in the defence and found it on the field with a non-protested beach that served for the road.
The quarters of the quarter attacked the Governing Council of the City of Solihull with the "not able to resolve".
One of the people who wanted to stay anonymously said to them: ‘They had a place on Monday evening after they had moved on the Bentley Heath Street, where they had a stone for the rest of the people.
The Governing Board should be able to resolve the problem because of its incapacity.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now returned.
Last night they arrived in another, and there's some more to come today."
She added: ‘Birmingham's Governing Board knows how to resolve this problem.
I'm living at the Streetsbrook and I'm not going to keep playing tax until the Governing Board with the Tourist is organized."
Another of the anonymous people said: ‘It's funny. Recently we've watched the last tourist and now they're back.
And this time they are still more, and this time they brought their horses with them."
The pressing chairman of the city Solihull said: ‘We are a home of an inappropriate residence in the country near the Streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with the local police, we undertake the necessary legal steps to resolve the whole problem.
And the most of the evidence, it is necessary to report the most local residents of any uncomfortable or anti-governmental policies at number 101.
We'll get a total picture that we'll bring to the court."
The European husband struck the car in Brussels.
He brought him to the Governing Special.
The government specialist transported the wounded robbert of Zwitnian to Bratislava in the middle of the midst of the south.
The airport was waiting for two sanities and the aircraft was inconsistently controlled by Slovenia’s doctors.
A long planned year, he went out without complication.
Robert Živnjanski, according to the information TV JJ, had a serious accident at the beginning of the year in Brussels.
He's been hit by the car and he's in a serious state since that time.
After transport to authority, one of the brothers’ diseases was transported to specialized workshops.
The economic analysis is the husband of the Slovenian Europoslankian Jana Zivňanski from NOVA.
She didn't want to express herself to the accident.

The Italians are forced to fight against the NGO backing ship with immigrants on the ground
Italy noted that it would be limited to the coming of NGO ships, which were attached to the area of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean, unless the NGO does not subscribe the new rules governing their operations.
"When the NGO does not sign the new rules of behaviour, it will be difficult for us to continue in their operations," said the Minister inside Marco Min in interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Min's warning came on the day after the Italian authorities partyed the German salvation organisation of Jugend Rettet for suspicion of trade with people, which is extremely easier to illegal immigration.
The protective organisation, which works for the first year, refused to comment the whole thing on the accusation of the Italian State complainant Ambrogia Cartöe.
"For us, and will be a priority for a number of salvation of human lives, so we are very hated that we can not operate at the current time in salvation areas," said the organization in the publication of social networks.
"All current accusations can be commented only after all information is stored and evaluated."
The Italian authorities followed the ship of Jugend Rettet.
Her debt is understood that she has transferred the immigrants to the ship that directly traded them with people, and it is repeatedly.
At least one meeting, according to the record of the complaint, only 1,3 miles from the border of Libya, published by the Italian media.
The seat of the ship is suspicious of the violation of the law and detention of the Italian coast guard, watching for salvation operations in this area - from humanitarian survival, more than anything else.
The Code of Behavior sets the presence of the Italian police officer on the boat, such as Ivanet to monitor activity.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-governmental non-governmental organizations participating in salvation operations have agreed with the maintenance of the code: Save The Children, Malt MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last named organisation stated that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, since they are not representing any "successful change or interruption" in relation to salvation operations.
The adoption of a new code of behaviour, for example, refused a medical organisation without a border (MSF), which is the Nobelovy price holder.
In the meantime, mine has been allowed to hear that a slow decline of immigrants in the last weeks that have been held in Italy for salvation operations indicates that it is attempting to strengthen the guards at Libya areas and to cooperate with local age.
"In the last days we start looking at the light at the end of the tunnel," said Minister.
He also discovered the plans for further negotiations that will take place in this month with Libya's care of economic development initiatives, as the representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali, as regards the reduction of the number of migrants that leave these countries in Europe's approach.
Unsupported Mesarosh: from overall, the sylicon and celllithis was thrown out!
Heavy years of age are completely inclined to take on themselves the most important thing that will cover the most interesting parts.
Only Dominica Mesarosh does it in contrast.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where it was herce, moderns, songs and all that had about TV Prima, just a hammer, its body was locked into mini overall.
And just a few running moves and models showed to everyone their silicons, but also a cockpit.
Overall, he's been thrown between the half, and he's grown so high that she's still needed to change it.
The attention of the gentlemen and the present photographs was not so determined.
Michelle Carter's sentence of text messages invited to kill Conrada Roye
A woman from Massachusets was deceived to take up freedom for two years for encouraging her friend to save self-mord by text messages and telephone talks.
The twenty-year Michelle Carter is sitting 15 months from the two-year trial behind the networks and then spent five years in the submission.
Carter was deceived in June for an insensitive murder of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father on Thursday at the court said: “The whole family is destroyed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left for freedom until the decision.
It was threatened to 20 years to take freedom, but her lawyers argumented that she and Roy suffered the soul of disease.
Carter was dressed in red wallets and chrome bloss, when she was proclaiming the judgment in the place with the laughs in the eyes, with the hands of hands and the eyes of the earth.
"Their commitment killed Conrad Roye," said the judge.
“He ended his life so that she could take herself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"They didn't prove any exhibitions."
However, the representative of Carter said that it was “a disappointment that is unfairly painful”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “they have an eye or a level of disorder or even the soul of disorder have no significant impact on her commitment”.
Regarding Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy’s statement, she read: “They will not run on one day, so that I may not lose my son’s loss.
• to be proud of me - I care about his sisters, and together we will suffer the pain that we will bring forever with us," it was stated in the statement.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy realized that she was "following her" in the case that she had never participated in the wedding brothers and never would have the grandfather of his children.
"The loss of a man with whom I saw from my birth is the pain that I will bring to myself to life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts has no valid law that would deal with a person who helps to kill another person.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 at the car seat, coated with carbon oxide.
The case took attention to the whole nation after the publication of the letters of Carter, which were subjected to self-mord.
"It's one thing that I have written in the texts that Carter's sent only two weeks before his death when Roy was allowed for a family.
A few minutes ago, she wrote to him, "You have to do this Conrad" and "It's just enough to get a generator and be free and happy."
The Court of Justice stated that Carter was aware of Roy's death and ordered to keep any comments in the print.
The case has asked many questions.
One of the people standing on Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced for the murder of his British companions in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, an accusation was accused.
Slide Knox (30) published the exhibition in Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, non-processing."
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to the island of response
The time before notifying Audi, the BMW car manufacturer indicated that he would offer his clients to update software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The President BMW said that the company would say that " there are more intellectual options than driver restrictions" in response to the European city - including Mnichova, which is the BMW seat - which consider the prohibition or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced in the deterioration that three million Mercedes cars were adjusted throughout Europe to reduce the diesel.
None of the companies called this decision as a station.
European car manufacturers promoted the use of diesel atmosphere in Europe and the United States in order to comply with carbon oxide Regulations.
However, the oxide of diesel engines is considered as carcinogeneous and can cause astm.
In addition, increasing the costs of the car on the installation of equipment to neutralize gases issued by diesel engines, which facilitates the competitiveness of cars.
While German car manufacturers are looking forward, Angela Merkel's office claims to discharge powerful car companys and to ignore their problems.
Communities are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, who has installed the limits in its vehicles, which has reduced the amounts of issued, but has been disabled for running submins.
A number of higher representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and the finals were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the termodynamics of the Audi Engine Development Department would have been arrested in Germany.
The former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is a Italian nationality and doesn't refer to the extradict, so it can lead to the court process in the United States.
At the beginning of the year, Audi joined the criminal investigation of the German police in the case of Volkswagen car after the authorities accused Audi from the installation of a system that had to cover Europe's limits - and extended the accusation that Audi sent to the United States.
Including Audi cars in investigation, it may have a big impact on Volkswagen: the luxe manufacturer of cars creates a direct share of the benefit of Volkswagen.
The airplane was on the beach.
The man and the girl are lost.
Unfortunately, Praia de São João in Costa da Caparica, about 30 miles south of Lisbon.
One of the SIC Noticias television channels said that the airplane was flying closely over people who were on the beach.
Some people from the beach have evidently fled from the danger of the sea.
Unfortunately, two people were unable to stop the machine.
On the beach according to local media, a 50-year-old man and a eight-year-old girl died.
"The flight was hurt and they were dead at the place," described local police boss Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not known yet.
The flight was two people, both out of the accident, and the police took them to hear.
D11 or how not put a distance.
And the valleys in Czech are complete?
I'll give you a thanks.
It's inappropriate, even though it started to be built in 1978.
Although it's not allowed, it's still checking.
And it shouldn't be made, even though it's a building authorization.
What's that?
Yes, D11's wallet.
The next building of her sequence at least for a few months has stopped the movement of the children of the Earth.
We're going to get a remote board on the coasts, like when they're covering the rooms.
They're covering the bottle and then they'll just see when and if we'll get another.
Then we don't want anything wonderful.
We just want to rotate the time of the road and we want to get traveling trucks to Poland or from Poland from the villages and towns.
Infinite car rentals are running directly through the town of Jaroford or Nachod, which is not as a reasonable object.
Since the last part of our exposed department has been carried out in 2008, then the incredible nine years ago.
Since that time, not the fuck.
Therefore, when recently started the building of four kilometers remaining infinite to the King's Royal Royal Royal Royal and in other areas, the archaeological investigation began to start at the end of the year, you could hear the voice of points in East Czech.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week, it was shown that he was building up for years.
And maybe not the next year.
The movement of the children of the Earth-Club for sustainable transport from Brna has also provided a distribution.
Children Earth repeat their tactics from D.D.
The decisions on building authorisation were attached to the whole range.
They shall request a review of all already issued duties of all relevant authorities.
For example, the Defense Ministership or the Royal Authority, for example, official magistrate, of the Ministry of Life, but also of the Ministry of Defence or of the Road Authority.
So, then, D11 and I are sitting near the village with a vocational name of the Sepulture.
So we're sitting down, we're just going through the distance, and we're just standing on the outside street, and we're giving a priority, and we're then set up into the columns.
The worst is that you see similar stories throughout the Republic.
Delicate, continuous travel on Benezov, D1 or D8.
Everyone has his funeral.
What are the Children of the Earth?
What is the basis of the issues of communication in Czechland?
And why is the current remote remote practice uncomplete in the current system?

Levandule from Provence threatens climate changes
Levandule became the symbol of Provence in South East France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Levanduli is conducted in the investigation of suicide and damage, which causes anxiety to the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, a professional of the Agricultural Research Institute of CRIEPPAM in Provence, stated: “The production of levandule in Provence is threatened because this plant has been made in the last few years by the changes of climate, which brings a less wheel on the jail and underground.
This affects the lives of levanduli.
It also has its wine on it, cicades and bottles, transfering microbacteria, which is given in the south water."
There's a lot in the kitchen.
Levandule of tourist and ́ai that is produced from them is an important part of parfums and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers grow smaller, unwinned and often weak plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these levandules is clearly less."
Possible solutions may be more efficient distribution of water and relaxation of water exhaust from the ground, but also the levandule's fluid protected mixture of yellow and water and sleeking of several species of distant in front of sugar time.
The pressure of the journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
The employees of the week of Riodoce are regularly meeting every center to discuss news about the disasters that are in the Sinaloa for organized criminals, corrupted officers and drug wars.
Today, however, the efforts of recent tasks are mainly due to their own security.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two served journalists talk about what would be more safe: to take their children with them into the office on which someone attacked by granate in 2009 or leave them home.
Safety experts wrote three simple words on the black table: anti-equivalents, neutrals and associates.
They ask journalists to introduce a name to each word - no evidence needs, it is sufficient to use the presentation and prejudice.
Choosing them from what - businessers with drugs, politics, businessers and journalists are understood that they take money from government or drug cards - the catalogue of criminals whose task is to hide crimes.
Violence does not stand and the body is overwhelmed over the whole country; journalists are still attained: According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 from the approach of President Enrique Pena Nieta to power in 2012; 589 journalists are protected after attacks and threats; and in all seven countries they have been killed seven years.
Among them also, the composer of the period of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The greatest error is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence that come with drug trade.
His loss is sensitive, although his presence is an accessible - a great picture of Valdeze with the title “Religiousness” on which a person shows, grows in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - ́em over 30 years, has a truck with the photos of Valdez with a smile on his face, brilliants on the nose and the heads of Panama.
The meeting is not completely two months after his death; the journalists speak of one another's traumatisms, night morning, insanety and paranois.
Although in 2010 a special federal procurement was established in order to resolve the cases of journalists, the Committee has now committed two suspicionates, in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of killings that come to each year are associated with drug trade and organised crimes.
The newspapers from Riodoce market will inform the violences that are in Sinaloe; even though they are the destruction of the lamentation and the area is very rare at present.
Without information on injuries and without the view of justice, the security meeting is free, says Ibarra.
“It is a foolish breaking time for such meetings” adds it.
"When we don't get more information, he can't trust anyone."
Tomorrow 15 May he left Valdez in the centre of Riodoce in Culiacan, the main city of Sinaloy.
He was able to catch a few blocks when his Red Toyota Coroll was stopped by two men who drove him out of the car and killed him with 12 shoes, according to the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelveth River.
The shooters then came into his car and bought it nearly from the place of work.
Valdez died in 50 years.
He left a woman and two adult kids behind him.
It seems to be width in Culiacan.
However, in the case of Valdez, there is a suspicious silence.
Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battles of the country as the cooperative fraction is trying to fill the empty place from the underground arrest of Guzman and its iron release to the United States.
Each day, in the streets of Sinaloi, a few people and seeds have been killed is full of two-patroned mazzols for the kings of drugs, of which many are more sensitive than houses.
Remember the moment that the word “progress” thinks that one drug cartridge controls the coast state with valuable stations and important travels that travel to the United States.
However, as the fact that Valdez was confidently informed of the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the partner and director of Riodoce still disappointed his friend.
He believed that two doubts contributed to his death.
The division of the audience with Lopez was the leader of one of the drug cards that led war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
The boy could break the sons; the suspicious groups cut all copies of the news at the time they arrived on the desktops.
The second error was not to cause Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the party of other news, in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico, and he seized his death as an important milk in the fight against mexican criminals against journalists.
He had to survive so, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the period of Noroeste, it was a veteran practice when in 2003 he decided to sell his share in $50 and set up together with the five members of Riodoce.
In Sinaloe, “the newspaper was unable to operate and not to mention drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Riodoce received a good news of the public and truthful report; the reports began to be given.
The newspapers were able to watch for problems and publish texts without censuring - the readers were fascinated to read stories that nobody else had attracted to issue.
Eight years after the storage, Riodoce wined a prestigious assessment of Maria Moors Cabot for the Latin America report.
The same year Valdez won the assessment of the International Freedom of Printing of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its Mexico Trade reports.
Valdez openly admitted his fear.
"I was afraid of my life," he said when the price was accepted.
Trading with drugs in Sinaloae is “the way of life”, Valdez said in October of the latest year in a conversation for Rompeviento TV.
“You must take the role of a journalist - or play a stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do to the face of death? Why didn't you say what happened?"
The employees of Riodoce were stuck after Valdez. A man was known by his impression and not by his tongue. He was a good friend who had given advice and objects - a factor who had made the way to survive.
Everyone looked at his daily routine.
He's always wearing his head.
He often walked to the bar of El Guayabo against the office and sat at the same table.
Now they're asking, "Is this rutine committed his death?
His death also asked questions about their own conditions -- how to do his work best and remain alive?
"It does not like them when you take care of their wives, children, pure business, secret places."
"These things were prohibited," said Bojorquez.
This results in high levels of self-centuary and self-sufficiency.
You have to trust your instincts.
You don't feel like it doesn't play something here, hands go away.
It's difficult in it, editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, "What's the meaning that can be shaken... and then happened to that thing with Javier."
The old rules in accordance with the terms of the remaining rules in Sinaloae are no longer applied - as in the states Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and the rest of the countries, which are a toxic mixture of lucrative nuclear paths, weak governments and corrupted policies.
The country is still changing.
There are no mobile phones allowed in the room where Riodoce's employees; a few days ago, spyware was discovered that bought governments to monitor Mexico journalists and activists.
Before the building, two police officers have a degree of 40 degrees in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were choosing a state to protect the Office of Riodoce, which is located in the four-country building in Culiacan's middle quarter.
The journalists feel that these police officers do not belong to those 50 percent of law protectors, which are according to the exhibition of the government of corruption.
It's already a few months that journalists have recently issued to the hornates, which are actually controlling drug cartridges.
There are three main stories for this week.
The murder of the brother of the former boxer Julio César Chaveze in Sinaloe.
It has also been dedicated to suspicious government expenditures that have passed in the country's family City.
Recently, some of the contributions in one of the most luxual restaurants of Culiacan, just a block from the office of the State representative.
Officially, no one notified the identity of the invoiced people or the circumstances of the income, so journalists were focused on writing about what every people of the city know: that the restaurant is a favorite destination of drugs and policies.
One of the journalists concluded that this restaurant was registered under the name associated with the actual policy that is a member of the Institutional Revolutional Party (PRI), controlling all levels of political scenes at least the past century.
Several Prime Facers have recently been accused of corruption on high posts.
Villarreal requested a journalist to write about the previous incidents that occurred in the restaurant, mostly an incident in which one of the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmana dismissed the military entity.
A month ago, the readers would read about this topic in Valdez Rubrica, which was the best source of information on contributions.
"Waldez would certainly have heard the case," said Villarreal (46), which is overlayed by "El Flaco" for his shielding position.
"Now all informers have turned back to us."
Valdez's office changed to the storage of cedules and an attachment to the protests against the murder of journalists.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez falled in a number of cedules and issued the next ability to demonstrate before the Office of the State Representative for the next journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michoacán State.
The offices claim that the DNA analysis is about Adame.
The activity of journalists is decreased throughout the country, and many of them organize protests and stick to travelers and SOS printing buildings.
The director of the news Bojorquez is a day to visit Washington, where he is trying to gain international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At the meeting with the Senaloy, who was held on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez charged the offices from the investigation of journalists and their murders for the proclaimment of the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked to transfer to another division of fear that her wrath could threaten her inside.
Valdez repeatedly stated that the mexican journalists are "inflated" by the organized crime, corrupt officers and public publics.
In his last book, the Narco-Journalist wrote that journalists die not only with drug cards but also with political and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The Medical Surveillance Group of Article 19 has committed more than half of all attacks on police journalists and public officers.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to shut you down," added Ramirez.
The wounds are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Marie Elizabeth Macias, which came six years ago at the northern borders of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with the message that evidently signed the Zetas card: "I've finished this for my messages."
There was a keyboard and a keyboard at the top of the heads.
Some departments have decided to complete the activity, such as the journal El Norte, sitting at the northern borders of Chihuahua, in response to the march murder of the rapporteur of Miroslavy Breach.
Others continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez celebrated public drug cards with the article on the entrance side with the name "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists went out of their homes or even through the border.
It's an unfortunate decision.
Finding a job in exemption is difficult, just as to avoid feeling that someone still persecutes you.
And journalists are investigated and killed, for example, in case of Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the refuge from Veracrusa.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their jobs each day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a bossman, admits that writing about drugs fears him.
"Mexico moves into the sand, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's a weekend, and Riodoce's employee sits on the road before the office - the latest issue was sent to the printer - drinking a beer when he starts calling on the phone.
They are learned that 19 people died in the town of Mazatlán, when the band and police members were shooting.
War is graduated, just as many messages left in this section were promised.
The journalists publish this news from the phone on the Riodoce websites.
It will not run any day and the introduction title will be changed again.
The sounds of the police sirene show another shot.
Bojorquez is looking at the police guard to convince whether he gives attention.
There's no fear. It doesn't make any evidence.
Under the major portrait of the falling partners of their periodic periods - whose staff is a pronunciation slogan for the whole Sinaloe - all of the employees of Riodoce follow his steps.
"How could they just think about the department," Bojorquez said, "when the same day when Javier was killed, one internist asked me to send her into the street?"
Dinosauries used a flash to avoid the enemies
The first look looks like a socha, whatever he's scared.
The scientists now discovered the conclusions of the first findings of the increasing creation of the size of the nose, whose finally maintained residues - which the experts called ‘Mona Lisua dinosauros’ - found a Canadian horn.
The remains were kept so high that experts could determine the color of the red wheat of his wheat and indicate that the dinosaur had a ‘processful past’.
In the newspaper Current Biology, it stated that there was one of the ‘the less preserved dinosaur found yet and one of the best species of dinosaur in the world’.
The stone is a new species of Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the Craig period, approximately 110 to 112 million years ago.
His finally maintained status was shocked by researchers who described him the words ‘consequently cautious’.
The rotated white is, according to National Geographic, the best investigated rock of its species.
Shawn Funk stands behind, who discovered the stone on March 21, 2011 when returning to Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberta.
He hit something that looked like a stranger and decided to examine it closer.
The stone was sent to Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
In the following six years, researchers have been working for the discovery of animals from a major country weight of 1100 kg.
After finishing work, dinosaur is ready to discover.
'It's enough to stumble the eyes and you'll believe that he's sleeping,' said the leader of Caleb Brown and the artist of the Museum Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is built.
“The story is completely written as one of the most beautiful and most inspired species of dinosaur - Mona Lisa dinosaur.”
In his neighborhood, researchers have made sure that this bullet - even though he was covered by the covering and walking dance - with great probability, he has caused a serious threat from the massive dinosaures.
The dinosaurus hardly used a red and white cambodge to protect the translators and used the masking system that uses many today's animals.
The experts claim that it enabled him to go better with their enemies and avoid their enemies. The masking system indicates that he was a favorite food of more dinosaures.
The reports of 110 million years of old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in the newspapers in May. Currently it is available to see Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The scientists gave him the name of Borealopelt markmitchelli after the technology of Mark Mitchell, who was working with the team over 7000 hours with careful physician discovery.
Thanks to the physician status, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of doctors could document the patterns and faces of shopping and burning throughout the body.
They discovered the masking method that currently uses the animals today in defense - the top of the animal was darker than its bottom.
Although this masking effect is running in the nature, the detection of researchers is surprising because the size of Borealopelta is far above the animals today using the same technology.
Thus, it is likely that dinosaurus was such a quantity of translators that evolution had given in the survival the preference of masking before confrontation.
Many current animals with masking - the example of ice, zebra and or sheep - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as a benefit, which indicates that nosodaurus had to fight about his survivory word.
‘The selling of the major and hard-dressed dinosaur illustrates the dangers represented by the preachers during the currency period,’ said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic ingredients contained in shops also discovered that the dinosaurory raw had probably red colored.
Scientists continue studying animals and watching after further knowledge of his life, including the maintenance of the wound, to keep his last eating.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was brought to the sea where he fell down.
In Alberta's village, the same fuel was at the same time as on Florida and the rivers today, and the oceans were gone much away into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is very careful in that it is completely covered in the finished skin contained in the finish and at the same time it is stored in three dimensions, and so you can see its powder size,” said Brown.
‘The animals appear to be practical as at the time of the clay.
For his reconstruction, you do not have to use your imagination; it's enough to cut off the eyes and it seems like it's just sleeping."
During the crown period, the extreme therapy, massive dinosauries, who moved on two feet.
Although the king of all dinosaures - Tyronosaurus King - lived a few million years after Borealopelta, this turned dinosaur could be a favorite benefit of his very terrible preachers.
It belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, 11,5 meter long monster with weight over 6 tonnes.
The scientists whose most recent discovery was published in the Current Biology magazine believe that the body of Borealopelta was split into the sea after it was mumified in the bathroom.
Shawn Funk stands behind, which discovered the stone on March 21, 2011 when suncor Millenium returned near Canadian Alberta.
According to the museum, one of the best inverted dinosaur in the world, including the rain and the burning, which is also complete from the chicken after the kitch.
The animal has reached the average of 5 metres and was estimated to 1300 kg.
He's got two centimeters of the oil out of his arm.
The scientists will say that this big man has spent the Canadian territory today until he ended in the river that smoked him into the sea.
His subseaker grave kept the body in a perfect state.
Fossil residues of this species are also maintained in a measure that the rotated floods around the leaf are still covered by the rest of the red.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “the finding of such an investigated one can be compared to the lottery exhibition.
As long as I follow him, the shocking find me feels.
Fossil residues of this species are also maintained in a measure that the rotated floods around the leaf are still covered by the rest of the red.
On his side, his right front feet lies with the fingers that go up.
I'm easily counting the bottles on his roof."
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell went throughout the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the parent of St. Louis sited on bed in Airbnb room and spent ads on Facebook on her phone.
Instead, she took a contribution to a medium-school-school.
"The police just shot a 18-year-old young man whose body is still in the street," it was.
She was surprised that nobody else wrote this article, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah continued to re-product its contributions on the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis published on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man who shot the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published the photograph of Brownov's body, which lies uncontrolledly on the street, from which no one brought her from four hours.
"It's crazy," she thought Ferrell.
But it wasn't for her and her community.
She left her phone to come back to him at night when she watched the twoths about people who fought on Canfield Drive.
She watched the photos of the police feasts and the rocks of people. One of the men claimed that my father was victim and in his hand holded the cedule with the title “The Fergusons police killed my unarmed son”!
She watched live news -- one of the cops stood before a group of protestants, holding a leader in his hands and at his second end of a shocking dog.
In another video, another police officer held, as she introduced, in his hands the weapons that he was looking forward and said, "I'll kill you all... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell said.
"This is not the type of murder we have used and we can call us normally.
I felt a fucking skin throughout the body.
"I was angry and wept."
Ihned's convinced her about the year and the second day she went home.
After arrival at 23:00, she brought her six-year daughter from her father and decided that they would go to Ferguson.
The occurrence of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson during the next three years described the new document Whose Streets, which will be listed in the cinema on 11 August.
It is a story of survivals and protests, love and opposition, strength and irreprehensiveness spoken from the view of people living in the community, who will go into the street and ask for answers.
On the road to Ferguson, Ferrell's dialogue with her daughter - dressed in the flower dress and the same flower churches - on the theme they had already been assembled many times - "the experience of blackness".
"Remember how I showed you how black people have to fight for what they believed?" She calls on a conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now, because the police killed a 18-year-old young man and it's not right."
"I didn't think I wouldn't take her with me," she said to Ferrell.
“The events today are the exhibition of... which has occurred in the past.
She had to do it and see her own eyes and grow in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but she had to know the difference between different levels of black experience and what we need to do for it, and-- they were free.
Although I'm able to ensure her submines that doesn't live on your own skin racism, it doesn't like any other way of black child-female.
I feel that if I had protected her from this experience, I would only hurt her."
Following the arrival to Ferguson, South Florient Road was the first station against the police department that became a basic activist who expected the words of the police officer Darren Wilson about his event of accident.
Here, Ferrell met her daughter with the local businessman who prepared for the final food.
They together prepared food in the cups and helped her to spread the protestants.
Ferrell's eyes started to get a new type of activism quickly.
"My activism turned up to the feet after August 9," Ferrell said and added that when studying at the high school of Missouri-St. Louis was a President of the Minority Student Nurses Assn, and asked for the introduction of health care and food in the Black Communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
For a few weeks, Ferrell was reported with a later co-register document, Sabaah Folyana during the dinner demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" the current event.
However, Ferrell said, "You're working on the document or trying to find a story that would be used?"
Such a type of skepticism came to community by many, often white people who wanted to make pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an unexpected conversation, “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and growing in Ferguson are very often remembered and we wanted to change it.”
Folayan has already been linked to cooperate with Damon Davis co-operator, who is a recognised local artist who is involved in the theme of death.
The project also intensified Ferrello and other six local residents who followed the "Whose Streets" team in years following the murder of Browna.
"In this document no one speaks about us, but it's our statement," said Davis.
"This was important for me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the goal of the document was not focused on Ferrells - in trying to show that the movement “is not about the salvation leader, but about the communication of the community,” Folayan showed that it is just more invisible to filming.
The Whose Streets document described the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she loved her wife.
"I felt like a naked," Ferrell said with a smile on his face at the first time she looked at the final version of the document.
"But I realized that to do this job and cope with black, I need to open it."
Ferrell's occurrence also highlights the role of the central black woman in a widespread aspect of Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three movement founders - who created in response to the murder of the teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - calls himself an entertainment.
"The Black Mediterranean women at the leading positions in the final trial are behind the behaviour of movement," Ferrell said, "for we continue to fight on more fronts.
The black outside women have to take the time of these events."
Folayan agrees with this exhibition and adds that “the destruction is supported by black women and a large number of high-sized black women”.
However, it takes the fact that “This is not simply to matter” and Ferrell is not the main herd document for its opinions.
"It was just that she was the power and energy source," she said.
“that she just feels in front lines is not a case, because life on these crossing in the black widow women's skin is dangerous.
You feel that energy rate too before the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the cameras of television stations have held their position, but a hard racial wheel between the community and the police remains.
Ferrell's two and a half-year submin for the blocking of the depths at the demonstrations.
Socially political atmosphere in a house, which she described as "Injustice".
Yet, she doesn't work in her effort to have been committed since three years ago to Ferguson's street.
“It is our obligation to fight for his freedom.
It's our obligation to win.
We have to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our rows."
The field was burned on Colony.
In the place there were tens of packers, he also helped the wallet.
Near the Czech ship in Coloinsk, between the foreigns of Billan and Liblice, burned from 14:00 a field of 15 hectares.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, the fabrics announced the third degree of fire of four possible.
According to the speaker, Ladislava Holomčik helped a fire from the air to make a whirlman.
At 18:00, the fire was made to the farmers to arrest, and the fire caused damage for 700000 crowns.
Tens of professional and voluntary farmers were fighting with flames in the place.
The fire came up for the technical impairment in the Motor Company Chamber.
Hasit also helped a whirlman who completely performed six water shots.
"We delivered the owner in place tomorrow to 8:00 will keep him to the unit of volunteers," said Holomchik today.
And Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using DNA Chelsea Manning
In the middle of one of Fridman Gallery's nearby rooms, a few of the faces of different shadows of the pool - white, black and snow - closed from the street on the streets. Each of them is like that of the eye.
All 30 portraits created Heather Dewey-Hagborg artificial from the winds of the mouth and hair sent by Chelsea Manning.
Maning sent her patterns from Fort Leaven日th, where an ex-analysis rejects the 35-year trial for the unrighteous publication of secret cableograms to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition started in August 2 is named A Becoming Resemblance.
It is an exhibition of the two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experiences with information and art, and Manning, a transsexual and prosecutive dissident, whose trespass has reduced Obama three days before his department from the president of the United States.
Algorithmical analysis of DNA Manning and I will use 30 portraits to illustrate how a man looks like this genotype, created Dewey-Hagborg a brief, unless a intellectual DNA subtitle comment - as well as many ways to interpret DNA - and an unrepentant determinism of these interpretations, as identities.
Maning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has already spoken of being a woman from the youth. It was deceived in 2013 on the basis of twenty excuses, including the violation of six Spanish laws, computer undergoing and crying.
All her photos were held by the employees. On the public only one white photo was disappeared in the lower quality on which Manning, visiblely concerned, is sitting on the seat of the driver in the platino blond paruce, which is now connected.
In 2015, the reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project were continued to be posted in 2012 Stranger Visions.
In the course of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic subjects - such as non-pauls of cigarettes and pigs - to create a picture of possible images of these people.
And just this time she received e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"Their interviews with Chelsea Manning in the process and wanted to comply with the portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opportunity of opening a new exhibition.
However, visits or photographs were not allowed, so they returned to Chelsea with a question whether she would have an interest in DNA portrait.
Artists and her prisoner muscles were scattered during two years of correspondence.
They even created a comic with the name Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who represented the vision of what would happen if Chelsea was missing and the exhibitions could participate personally.
The president of Obama a few days after the release of the comics requested the release of Manning, which was a welcome change after some inconsistent years made in the military campaign in Kansas.
In fact, it is interesting that the exhibition runs just in the time when Donald Trump is fighting people who are trying to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while they are trying to find new ways to encourage their twice in the situations that should be supported.
In the answer to the question regarding this special time, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “all are from the depth”.
Under the announcement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls her great signature (written "i" in the receipt is in the heart broken) after the end of the "social fractionary based on the seed, race, sexuality and culture".
On the other hand, the sequence of its mitochongdrial DNA - a hundred letters C, G and A often mentioned.
In order to include 200 letters (for nucleotids, according to the sophisticated artist's vocabulary) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological page, we all are.
"I hope people will take out that our genealogy does not depend on who we are, and that genetic data are entities and everyone can express them after its own," Dewey-Hagborg said. To see its work Spaurious Memories of 2007, it is on the video theme.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last exhibitor of the exhibition located in the room is the only page of the graphical news above.
It shows Manning how King Kong's way of the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a megafon in his hand.
"When the destruction is to you, they win," it says.
"Never let you shut down."
"It is a direct record of one of the letters," said the filedelfs artist.
"When I think about it, I'm going to shoot my wheat."
Maning has not been personally visiting the exhibition - which was predicted in the comics - but when that happens, it will be welcomed in the middle of his room with its own masks, with its own genetic figures, as a damage of protestants.
What was also the exhibitor of the exhibition, in particular about 160 cm high socks of Maning, on which its genetic happoshops are severely mentioned.
"In the past, they were located on the walls, but this time I wanted to save the damage," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
"I wanted to introduce the idea of the mass movement that takes the like of Chelsea and releases it."
Professor Northwest University and Oxford's University's employee are searched for murder
In these days, the international monitoring after Professor of Northwest University and Oxford University employees, who were deceived for the suspect of the murder of a man found to die in a lush Chicago apartment, introduced the police.
On Monday, a carrier was issued for the first degree of murder on a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their detailed partnership in the death of Trenton H. James Course-Duranleau, reports the Cook County County.
The document says that Cor¤-Duranleau (26) died for the results of some of the wounds.
The Chicago police declared that the body of the dead was found on July 27.
The police were warned of the phone calls. After the arrival to Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with some market wounds.
Cor-Duranleau was announced at the place of a dead and detective investigates the case as a murder.
Lathem worked at the position of a percentage of microbiology and immunology of the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University for Publicity, in his e-mail statement, stated that Lathm is now allowed to administrate and was prohibited to enter the University University.
“The whole matter is currently investigating the competent authorities and the Northwest University is fullly cooperating with them” said Cubbage.
Warren is an executive financial manager at the Oxford University.
The Language University and Somerville College reported: "The British police contacted us and we are ready to assist the American police."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted to register the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, leader of the public of the Chicago Police Department, claimed that he invited the sospedants to return to the competent authorities.
"The police has information about the location of their residence and the trial of examining the suspicious ones," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that the police support local, regional and international authorities in the holiday after the suspicious.
According to Guglielmi, she received a phone from the Grand Plaza building manager, which was warned of the event to come in the apartment 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi indicated that it wasn't worth whether the incident had occurred on July 27.
He added that Lath and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
The leader Grand Plaza issued a declaration for all residents: "The police now works for the establishment of time review and profile of the victim and investigates different motives, including household victory."
"We will finish the WADA plan in quick future" – the president of the Russian Government Mutko
The Central President of the Russian Government Vitaly Muko noted that it was a long time and that it would be implemented by the World Antido Agency (WADA) and the renewal of the Russian Antido Agency (RUSADA).
“The current part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and the RUSADA has already received the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Antido Agency (UKAD).
As regards this ability, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko reported on Thursday.
The chairman commented on the second part of the WADA plan on a code-declaration - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which has recently been published on the web sites of the organization.
According to Mutka Codex, there is nothing that Russia should be concerned.
“All was notified and all will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympics Committee (IOC) and WADA at the closest time," added.
One of the criteria mentioned, however, calls after the public notice of the WADA investigation results, which Richard McLaren investigated, on a specific sponsoring to the Russian sporters from the Government.
The subject Mutko said: “We take an investigation because our antido system was obviously missing.
It was attached to all measures.
However, there were no state programmes in our country, so we can't recognize something that never existed."
The tortuous words confirmed Vitaly Sövenv, the Russian independent public anti-dependent Commission.
In the discussion on Russian RSport Sünnov, Russian antido factors recognised the problems, but added: “In many occasions, we have noticed that the report contains contravention positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept a message completely without exemption," Sövnov said.
WADA understood the RUSADU from the exhibition of the controls in Russia in November 2015 without before the scandal.
However, the organization authorised the planning and combination of tests under the supervision of international experts and the British Antido Agency (UKAD) in June.
After visiting the Moscow Centre of the organization in July, General Director WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "in the right way" to renew validity.
The police accused three people, one is a young man.
The police accused three men from the arrest of the middle fire of a rare tree bone in Trince-Gutech to Frydeck-Misteck.
One accused is a youth, all three are Czech nationalities.
For a criminal act of general threat, they are threatened to 15 years of procedure.
To the journalists today said that's the Moroccous police manager Tomás Kužel.
There was a sensible crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police at the present works on the motive of all the matter," said Kugel.
He noticed that the police would act on the possibility of taking the accusations in the liaison.
More information according to the Director cannot be published.
"I can't yet communicate, because the workers work on things are working for criminal police and investigation and the State representative who observes the matter," said Kugel.
The tree church of God’s body in Guteh was buried from the 16th century.
He was a valuable memory with many pneumatic equipment and images from the first half of the 16th century.
Important damage will come according to the preliminary estimates of ten million crowns, but historical loss is unnumberable.
The injuries after fire began to consider the renewable cossel.
Most costs should be covered, further costs are prepared to share the Ministry of Culture and City, also prepared the public collection and calculated the contribution of the owner of memory, then local pharmacy.
Similar tree church of the Holy Caterina from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrab also destroyed fire 15 years ago.
It has done this at the time of the electro-installation.
Then there was a precise copy in his place.
State counts with citizens at the defence of the State.
They'll support their education.
With a financial support for the sexs used for the protection of the State, with voluntary shoot education or with the team of educational students, it shall calculate a significant purpose for the law for the preparation of citizens for the defence of the State.
The Ministry of Defense, which has been taken by the Government, promises from the way that it will enhance the physical ability of the Czech and their ability to be used in crisis.
It comes out of the way that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law would be adopted in the future, the State would invest a number of hundreds of million crowns.
The basic goal of recovery is, according to its authors, to create a system that would help to increase the preparation of the Czech Republic for the defence of the State, notwithstanding the executive obligations and on the basis of voluntaryness.
For example, financially or materially, it would support radiomaters, shooters or cyclologists and enable them to increase the capacity of their members.
On the payment, he would receive information about people who are willing to come to the country during the crisis and their ability or material equipment.
Acreditations may also be available to the instructors who would help the members and other interesters in training or training.
It also calculates the organization of words with military veteranes or people who have held themselves herdically.
One of the possible variants suggests that a new authority should be established to take care of the administrative and coordination of the project.
The authors highlight that people should be voluntary and have been able to use their ability after the statement of threats.
"The whole concept must respect the progressive control of previous clear limits between individual types of threats," it is stated in order to refer to the danger of such hybrid threats.
The Ministers noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the largest number of capabilities, not only those military.
"The basic objective of the purpose is to create a very large basis that allows every citizen to respond to the threatening sustainability of the State or life, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, where appropriate, to contribute to the protection of others, and to avoid the performance of the tasks of the Czech Republic's armed forces," it states the purpose.
The adoption of the law would bring a few financial charges.
Their above will, according to the Ministry, be involved in the selected variance.
For example, the Authority provides financial support for projects for the preparation of citizens for State defence to up to 100 million crops.
If the administration and coordination centre were designed, its operation could be about 60 million crowns annually.
Other money would be payable or building a system of information.
We also assume that the operation of national military rules should be extended, which would be able to work with other 42 soldiers.
The representatives of the Ministerial Ministry have already stated that the law should also be helped to resolve the unconsensitiveness of some Czech policies with the introduction of the Directive of the European Union on weapons.
His adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to keep some weapons commanded by the Directive.
Startups that your company will help not to go with another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to satisfy the peace of the workers of her e-commerce startup, but she didn't find an appropriate investigation.
The answers were often inappropriate, unusual, or even claimable.
And although she promised anonymity to investigation, some employees have expressed their incredible confidence in the whole process.
"I was looking for efficiency and objective," Errett, the owner of e-commerce to Madison Reed's hair care company with a seat in San Francisco, who employed 75 people.
So she asked for a sound help.
On the market, new startups from the collection of human resources are continued to be discovered, which helps the company with the satisfaction of employees.
The creation and licence of software with a specific purpose to measure the obligations of employees allows the company to launch the vote, target specific teams and demography groups, further offers a complete anonymity of employees and a heavy line for the delivery of stumbles, and in some cases also allows the informators to interfere and contact the director directly.
"In the market there are tools like Strava and Fitbit who follow your health status, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, a partner and a general startup manager of Glint with a seat in Reedwood City.
Errett concluded that, thanks to Clinton, she received three years more reports about what her employees think and feel.
Furthermore, the study and voting of specific teams offers Glint a temperature map to the company and a flexible review of groups with the highest number of deficiencies, as well as the review of low evaluation managers - which allows the employer to work on the correction.
Communities begin to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the workshops - for the case that it would be another Uber - which is recorded in scandals after the ex-employed employer published in his blog a contribution described by fire rubbers and demands of employees who are refusing to speak openly.
For startups as Glint is a request for the survey of the Fire Culture of Lucracy’s business opportunity.
According to the Lat's Talk Payments website, which is a technical and financial progress, the value of the global sector of control, regulation and compliance may exceed $118,8 billion until 2020.
Startup Convercent from Denver in Colorado State, who helps the company to prevent and discover an inadequate behaviour, saw a small increase in interest and activities at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandal.
Among nearly 600 clients of Convercent belongs Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber also accepted under his glasses.
Similarly, as Glint allows the Convercent to send adjustable "bleck" research, to facilitate confidential information in real time and to display the temperature maps of problems.
It also offers anonymous text heavy line that allows employees to report inevitable behaviour.
If the general manager is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the administrative Council.
"The Court of Justice of Public Changes has powerful regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and the Executive Director of the startup Convercent.
The company is certified from an incorrect consequence with its employees or non-ethical behavior - and if it does not exceed regulators - it may be able to take the cost of the successors in the result of the battle of the clients, the disturbance of employees or the judicial procedures, added Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, employing more than 25,000 people over 500 places, uses Convercent more than a year to increase the responsibilities of employees on firework principles and procedures and to ensure a easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if the employer wanted to report any problem, he had to search for a phone number or e-mail for the management of the company, officially providing complaints and hopes in an emergency solution.
It was often about a disappointing and unfair experience, said James Vitrano, the general representative of Ruby Tuesday, who seemed to have no easier way to investigate the employment.
Now, when the company uses the Convercent, it is guaranteed to detect and resolve problems that have never occurred before to the managers sitting in the offices, for miles away from the solution of the disturbance, such as discrimination, disturbance or injustice.
"It is close to the holy, general view of the experience of employees," Vitrano, who leads a group of Ruby Tuesday's company watching risk management.
"We will protect the actors from the courts of the employees."
Communities stopped breathing ethics, values and employees for easily weight in 2002 after Arthur Andersen's annual company was injured after Enron's fall in the disuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But just when “they have dedicated all the things the social media, ” the companies began to realize that they cannot easily hide their chests in the box in the online world.
"Before people began to use the ethics to follow, they rejected faith," added Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of service for which the company pays regular payments.
It is a business model and opportunity to approve the adversity investors who supported both startups.
Convercent chose his unor campaign from fire like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital totally $10 million and finally took up $47 million.
In November, the Clinton received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and throughout the campaign had $60 million.
These investments are very surprising in view of the mutual weight of company, culture and risk.
The increased number of research confirms that today's employees expect more than ever before.
And on competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, there are no major benefits for high payments and interesting projects.
The employees want to be accepted and evaluated and to maintain their time to the company who is attempting to postpone positions.
“When people are happy in their work, they realize that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they ask for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, the vice-president of global benefits and the employment benefits of the LinkedIn, which uses Convercent and Glint.
The investors will develop, if the companies and companies are able to prosper, if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytic tool is found on the market that ensures the employment and the commitment of employees to the company, it is not wonderful that investors will be found to support this effort.
According to professionals for the work of culture, it is important to provide data on the satisfaction of employees.
But the same data are inappropriate if the company doesn't take the necessary steps.
The fact is that when the company requests a returning link from its employees, it can make great changes.
And if the change doesn't happen -- in the worst case -- it can call a disappointment and no interest in employees.
"As you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversions," said Raath, the advisory director of the Cotter International company, who was a witness to many companies who were too dealing with the same data.
"Because when you do not reach the end of things, the employees will start to ask, "Have they heard me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should that be interested in me?
Madison Reed, who regularly conducts an investigation between employees, will be able to solve the problem by means of the Clint to one day, introduced Errett.
After repairing the back commitments from employees who were frustrated by late decisions and quality of communication, Errett had able to reorganize several teams in the company and to start the training of the communication to the immediate solution of the problem.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important view of its employees and hopes that it will achieve high employment in the field that is known as frequent release.
“When you do not try to create a transparent worker, the employees will believe you,” added Vitrano.
“And when you start losing employees, you will come to the clients.
And with the dismissing of the clients, the whole company is broken down."
Thursday he became the warmest day.
Thursday, 38.3 degrees mentioned in the Watchtower of Hodonin to the most warmest day of the year in Czechland.
He convinced such an attack that was the most warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
They informed the work of the Czech Hydrometheorological Institute.
In contrast to the attack on Thursday, but there were no many temperature records.
Vedra's mainly embraced Moraw, in Czech was very cloud.
In the destruction, records were convinced or equipped to 35 of the 145 orological stations measured over 30 years.
On Thursday, the record was only nine times measured stations.
Perhaps today the temperature was the same in the Watchtower as the previous record of 2013.
In the Ireland to Brussels today, 37.4 degrees, the p p p p p p p p a rate of four decades per degree and in the Birnish's current 37.1 degrees has increased the record of three decades.
Both records were entered in the Watchtower of 2013.
High temperatures have appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia today.
After the Watchtower, the biggest leader was in the Dijakovi's districts at Znoemski and Broad over Dyya in Brussels, where the record was coincidenced by 37.8 degrees, but it did not overcome.
In contrast, for example, in Western and North-West Czechland, the highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsia.
"The temperatures started growing up to the afternoon," said the orologists.
The current roads in Czechland will be gradually decreased, according to the CHMU, and on Sunday they could also come to a greater rain.
In the most places of Moravy, but high temperatures will remain on Thursday and south-east of Moravy and Sabbath.
We've got such a nightmare here.
The billion people will lose the same voice in elections as every full-year man in the land.
They want to decide directly, and because not all are guarding as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Major Penty Marek Adspeek with other colleagues behind the water of Martin Burdou and Antoni Frych sponsors Robees' Reality.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Aliance finances the owner of the security and business in the realities of Paul Sehnal, who is also the president.
The deceived corruptor and the king of the Czech Hazard Ivo Valenta have appointed the Party of Privacy.
Political movement Agrofert, as the draft Andrey Babysha didn't want to call the cross-border Jaroslav German, it's the same for himself.
The Starosts also took their billions recently.
I'm Dalibor Baby, the owner of the Jablotron security equipment.
According to his own words, he enters the policy because he does good.
The entrance in the old dress, but the grandfather wasn't so much.
"I never hated a small goal," he said on the printing.
This means that my goal is to move the United Nations to get the Starost movement 20 percent in the elections.
Leckdo spent.
The grandmother's overwhelming, but it's more significant.
Milliarder Dalibor Baby is a man of strong views.
Although she's able to take care of the votes of the walkers in the Starost's dress, she continues to support Andrey Babische.
The boy supported Baby in the past parliamentary elections.
"Babish isn't a shooter and doesn't rule the Libyan political hair restaurant," he wrote about it before the elections of 2013.
Of course, it's not political because he wants to be a person.
My grandfather's gonna stay a hero for me.
He's willing to get out of his world, who's under control, and do something for us all.
Soon after the Large presented her as a new job, he recognized her wonder to Baby again.
And he said he wanted the Starosts to learn my partner with Baby to imagine.
Some can appreciate that the child doesn't change his views and stands out without a view of what the dress is just wearing.
Others can speculate whether Grandpa is sending to the Stars to build a boy of someone like this.
Others can ask if the boss of Jablotron should not have gone with the boss Agrofert in the business and does not seek another way to protect his business rival.
By Grandpa's public exhibition, but it wasn't just around Baby.
The boy promised to send the Starst to the campaign ten million crowns.
And if they'll need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, someone would have stopped the similar expression.
The recently recognised Court of Justice of Zdenek Bakala before elections in 2010 broadcast millions on all sides.
The Political Division of the Security Agency of Vita Barty, TOP 09 and the citizens of the Democrats have come to the freedom of 30 million.
But today's another time.
The Law prohibits any political side to give more than three million.
When the child is already in the policy, he could at least train the game rules.
Maybe he shouldn't have asked why politics have such a bad story in us.
His first days in politics, then, the Grandpa crowned the tax advantage of the family with the students.
People with high school education will come to us monthly for fifty thousand.
I'll be based on you on the twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in the present circumstances.
The one with the twenty poor.
In the Witness view, the poor company is honestly paying taxes and riches benefit from the functioning of a social state, which is not too divided.
The rich must be helped soon that they don't care about the nutrition.
Ancients to their new accommodation can congratulate each other and Grandpa's hands.
We'll even be grateful to Grandpa, we can confirm that billion are not a lot of people.
Then there's another question of whom to love.
For me those who know the rules of games and want to keep them.
Those who are members and members of their sides, citizens and citizens of the State, do not have their employees and country for their own possessions.
Finally, those who want to live well in the rich land for all, not for some.
Nobody wanted the Trump.
The Wil complex had to exhaust 234 million.
It's not easy to sell property sometimes.
And often he doesn't help 11 beds, a beautiful look on the sea, or the fact that the opportunity is selling the president of the US Donald Trump.
During the sale of the village complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price was lower than 8 million dollars.
He informed this Mirror.co.uk web.
The brochure says, "Good, Donald J. Trump."
Switch to the place as no other.
However, the connection of the reality company with the American President did not cover an extreme price.
Donald Trump had to decrease the price of his Caribbean seat for incredible eight million libers.
The P-priority price was 21,5 million billion billion billion, and the final price was decreased to 13 million billion billion billion billion.
The village complex is soon as 76 prominent apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to wonder.
The seat of 5 acres on the Santa Caribbean is available for 12 full-valuable bathrooms, 11 rooms, many eatings, professionals and other rooms.
It's combined with some buildings.
The part of the ground is also basen and tennis curt.
There's tens of bullets on the ground.
There's a beautiful look on the sea from the teras.
According to the realistic experts, it was shown at the price that the connection with the President was not sufficient to join potential buyers.
Now the need is closer to the current prices of the inability on the island.
Trump purchased an opportunity in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million dollars.
The incapacity was to buy for the rental.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most precious opportunity on the island of Saint Martin.
With a new price, but it's sorting to the other place.
Incapacity in the neighborhood was estimated at 13,5 billion billion.
NCAA decided to recycle two trends daily. For Bruins, it is a long day.
The 11th afternoon and players of the UCLA university are close to the side of the new school board.
Some of them slip their dress and discover the worth of the back of the first day of the train camp.
For the number of members of the team these minutes, no weekends shall be paused by the southern break.
Players will go to rooms after a three-hour trend to study at final tests before they return to Watman Football Center to the meeting that is held at 6:30.
"For these boys will be the next three days of a tract," said Dr. Bruins Jim Mora for a minute before the Sunday is overtaken in the district.
By arranging two trains on one day, NCAA wants to delay the players - paradoxly the train days are still longer - then at least until the weekend, when the final tests end.
This is the reason why the first three UCLA trains are planned at 19:15 - to be so scared to many students already.
At the first time, in six sessions, Mora traveled on the trainer position in Westwood, the train camp Bruins starts in a week before the last year, and the trains are in the year's seat. It also has a decision to limit the range of trains from two to one day.
In total, tenth of trains are planned up to August 20, which begins formal preparation for the first storage against Texas A&M team, which is held in September.
Mora had been allowed to hear that it supported the NCAA decision, although it added another item to the already so covered diarrhood of players.
"Tree or four days are players under great stress and it's very exciting for them," said Mora.
"But no one has given it, all are trying, they are great.
I think in the Sabbath, when we have more time, everything will be quiet."
UCLA will be closed after the finishing of the train camp, which is easily when looking at a line of environmental areas from an added park and a luxe hotel of Luskin Center, which has conceived players after the screening of a protective network of cow.
The Bruins players should have a hotel for the start of this week, but Mora recognises that when the room is empty during it, it could be a problem.
"The territory will keep the security service," added Mora.
“The security is broken, but it is not deceived that someone can find peace and play our trains.
It's a good business with such material.
The hotel will be happy to keep the security, as well as the parking number 8.
We're going to use our max.
I believe everything's gonna be fine.
Everything is planned."
Facebook plans more basic control of facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and show discovery under the puzzle contributions in trying to fight such a fake news, introduced the largest social network on Thursday.
The community in the report on its websites writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect potential hoax, which will send third parties to verify and potentially show the results of the research under the articles.
Facebook was marked as one of the main sources of false reports and many believe that these uncertain messages have affected the low election of the President of the United States.
In Europe, political debates are conducted, and the French electors are broken by false reports on the More President's elections, and Germany plans with a prejudice to severe elections to deal with social media networks, if it is unremoved to be an irritable contribution.
Facebook on Thursday, in his next statement published in Germany, stated that he wanted to start the testing of new mail control in the United States, France, Netherlands and Germany.
"Besides showing messages to third parties, people ask more areas to be better information and to decide exactly what they can share," said in their blog Sarah Su, the product reporting manager of Facebook.
She added that Facebook company continues to test the "contracting articles" test and also works on other changes to reduce the number of false messages.
Creation of graphical news: story of A Castle in England
The small town of Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the musical video clip of the Sque-group and its apartment also found Margaret Thatcher during the 70s and the 80s of the past century.
Scotney, however, was from his appealing place at the river Beë in the British Kentu a 700-year witness, who inspired the nice Jamie Rhodese from the York City - a known interest in historic documents - to create graphical news.
"The view of a person's font that is 300 years after death," Rhodes says with a serious face.
"When I keep a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The Graphical News A Castle in England documents the life of a family living in the garden of Scotney from the centuries to the Eduard's period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony Mayigeith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first book of Rhodes inspired: it is also the author Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), the collection of inspired British Books - a project that was very emotional.
"I was able to print my fingerprint on a letter that wrote a double agent in the 70s who worked for Jacobity," he said.
"This is his fingerprint!
And the letters are like smoke, because in those times you had to read the light.
When I'm going to join my letter now, 300 years ago, it's like I'd come back in time.
How I love yours!"
For someone who is so fascinated with old papers, the support from the National Trust and Arts Council of England is the opportunity to stay at the room almost four months as a dream.
Rhodes spent time to examine the victorian "new" building, to conduct and to study a lot of stocks and somezites, such as the head of hyen on the wall and the woods that have been thrown after centuries in the coast.
He broke over the ground and examined the ruins of the old garden, talked with the widows, the gardens, and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
In the night, he was "doing whiskey and writer."
The trusted history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust organization has received access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last birthday, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived in the place of about ten years later, the employees started to go into the words that Rhodes described, as when “aristocrats of many centuries are broken with the words: ‘Watch it into the underground’.
Journals, letters from the British Empire Time, maps showing property: "You may think that the conflict of land is poor," Rhodes said, "but I've been attacked on one case when two families were disturbed about the break.
Leave that people!"
Some stories in the book use the village as a reflection town and go to the deepest in the Ethiopian history, including a story named The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves a new building building to join the culotic resurrection of 1381.
"I found a record of rebellion in 1380, which was in the book Knightly familys of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
“The English resurrect began in this area, and I thought that the rebellion was a good standard point.
Maybe he's finally connected together."
Other stories are closely associated with the story of the city - for example, The Priest, who explains the story of the Jezuite priest, whose family was covered by Darrello after seven years during the epical reform.
Or The Smuggler about the 18th century's age named Arthur Darrell, who evidently insinuated his own funeral when he filled the rocks (which was done for a few years after the discovery of the cancer).
Darrello’s favorite family, Rhodes, says: “I was a man - the men who were employed and lost money for the things they couldn’t allow.
Different generations of Darrell's families resolved it by taking rich or old panics - I imagine that they were looking gentlemen who were moving the heads of the grandparents with you."
With the end of the apartment at the garden of Peter Rhodes after other goods.
Recently, he returned from a two-day station in the Finnish divorce, where he was inspired for his next book about Elämanm, which was the former sanatorium from the beginning of the 20th century, which was deceived by nature.
But for Scotney, it's a special place.
"I was silent when I left," he said.
"I said to me, "Now, I'm going to go back to real life."
Washington changes the submins of giving green card
Media published the words of President Donald Trump on the new US immigration plan, in which it will also be changed by giving a green card.
It is estimated that a number of legal immigrants would be so decreased by about 50,000 in the light of the closer rules for the provision of temporary working visions and the restriction of family views.
New rules are subject to the Republicans and the Presidents.
The law will be submitted to the Congress soon.
“This law decreases poverty, increases billion dollars for tax chargers, and we aim to amend the rules for the delivery of green cards to the residents of the remaining countries.
The Law limits the beginning of the accommodators and replaces the current schemes.
The new application process for the pre-English speaking requesters, who are able to show ability to benefit our country," Trump, quoted media, said.
Sexual robots are on access - they had to be at attention
Just when it seemed that 2017 couldn't be bizarre, a report on the Internet on the development of sexual robots will appear.
Yeah.
Sexual robots are currently real.
Organization for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has recently issued an announcement on the development of sexual robots in the next five to ten years.
According to the words of an ancient professor of robotics and artistic intellectuality at the Sheffield University and the FRR Noel Sharkey's partner, it is necessary to look seriously on sexual robots access.
The clients can choose the color of the eyes, the face of the sight and the view of the robot's neighborhood.
"The people are increasing, but they sell growth, and we must be ready to see them more frequently," Sharkey said at the opportunity of publishing the message.
Modern sexual assistance changes from your inflammation to a robotic woman with a silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm - it is evidently a artistic intellectual that imitates human behaviour.
The user can "modify" the robot to his image - from the eye colour and the face of the wheel to the view and colour of the nests.
It is very worrying, however, that many robots have their own "personality" that would also be a shameful Stepford panch.
Modern fucking girls developed in a robotic woman with silicon skin.
RealBotix's robot holder can set his replacement woman to set different characteristics, including their livelihood.
And then there is a sexy robotic woman Roxxxy Gold to True Companion, which is added to the previously programmed characteristics, including "frigid Farrah", which is indicated by an eyewitness and the "wonderful Wendy" with "good" power.
“The Roxxxy Gold person is designed to make your personality in the most possible way,” it writes on the True Companion website.
So he has what you like, and in turn.
She's even an insult, just as people.
It may be stuck, challenging or “in appeal”.
The collection of sexual robots is alarming immediately from some of them - between which there is no replacement for interlide relationships. Inquiry is more than subordinate women's characteristics and violence - such as frigid (reading) Farrah.
True Companion on his website compares Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"When can a woman have a vibrator, why could a man not have Roxxxy?" it writes on the page.
However, sexual robots are not only a fetish or sexual help.
Their appearance and extremely perfect sophisticity indicate something more dark and deeply incorrupted in our culture - a decline from ideal or decrease of equality in the direction of the submanitive sex with the electoral adversity.
Most men do not understand the robotic woman and while FRR talks about their growing favorites, sexual robots remain in the area of the wide public interest.
However, this border interest can be a spectrum of the current modern system.
And most people are not strange or violent until they have a free market.
It is not a chance that these sophisticated sexual robots appear at the time when women throughout the world exercise their rights and in the White House sits the president, who is often very disgustingly expressed at the address of the woman.
The most terrible aspect of the series of the Service Periods is not what we see - shaded body and deep eyes, as more reality of these visions.
The lowly proposal of the service office represents a step in the right direction, but at the current time it seems to be a small piece.
Sexual robots are owned if myself is more like women (which is with pornoheric measure).
Their creators construct them so that they are pleasant to touch and act on the first view as a true woman.
However, when their “personality ” comes, robots cannot replace a woman.
They can't divorce with their partner or just leave.
They don't have any jobs or stories, nothing that would undermine their independence or reject their loyalty to their Lord.
In other words, they're good slaves.
It says 21th century: Service.
The NBA star on the green atmosphere.
Curry's coloring in California a corner.
The star basketballist Stephen Curry did not lose the first packaging at the primary start between professional golfists.
Double-personal evaluation holder for the most useful NBA player has played at the Ellie Mae Classic tournament lower Web.com Tour in the California Hayward first round on 74 ran and will fight for cut.
The Golden State player, who received a second title in the NBA team in this season, started very nervous and his first breath ended in the drinking holder in the golf vehicle parked at Fairwaye.
Even after that, there wasn't between the jackets as precise as under the basketball pack, but behind the balance of four wounds over couples, he left ten professionals.
"It wasn't an ideal way to start, to call the decisionman immediately after the first breakdown, but then it's a little seat," Curry said with that he fell on him a big dream.
It was very nervous to get the first turn, but it was all I hoped in.
"If you tell me I'm going to play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," added I.
When Curry will be able to lose a bullshit, which will probably be set under two couples, it will become the first representative of another sport that can be able on Web.com Tour.
"I want to play the next better and now, when I've lost the trees, it may be going," said the high golfist, who has already played in the past on tours to celebrate and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals.
In Hayward, he starts first on a tournament that falls under the PGA.
At the end of Ellie Mae Classic, he received sponsoral exception and kept his amateur status.
Web.com Tour series is about one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big winning?
Instead of this, Mitt Romney's awareness of healthy mind.
The unclean sign of the era of Trumpo is the political divisions that divide American electors, and also in a micro-dimensional manner the entire family.
During Wednesday and Thanksgiving, it was in American newspapers to help consult the family who love Trump.
We're probably just waiting for the nerves to allow us.
However, less attention is entitled to the Trump ability of the family to steal.
I'm talking about that because this week my sister was visiting me in New York - a basketballer and a fany that lives in Chicago and who pays for a Republican football in our family for a period of time.
She reminded me that the severity of the face in the face of a common enemy could have a strong enemy.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family is at once - including all the Republican conferences with which it has been deceived for a long-year policy - on one wheel.
At the dinner at the family table, it's a good thing, but it's threatening me that it represents a significant risk in a larger context.
Trump forces the left, but the negative point of his presidentship is able to put us all on the right.
We're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to anxious possibility that his scars can lose the attractiveness one day.
However, there is a more terrible scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the right-case republicans, which, in contrast to its standards, will be surprised by the confusion of what is called rational.
In these days, with nostalgies in the heart, I take on Mitta Romney and his version of foolish negotiations - dogs on the cotton, 14% tax from the income (which at least we had reports about his tax recognition) - from which both examples seem to be compared to Trump as a very mild overcome.
After Trumpa is leaving, the next Republican candidate will be at least normal, and it will be an unfortunate improvement.
We used my sister's visits and we took children to Central Park on the largest round that operates a non-oral park division -- for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't have coffee.
The horses are bitter, the middle war is to cover a stuck - clowns and animals are attracted and looking at their own rams - a completely humble view and a cinking music to buy public transport.
A lot of silences will soon be cut off: the view of high buildings, the panorama is looking at, instead of breathing the atmosphere and the reality of the city is not your imaginations.
About fifty years later, I haven't yet passed through the fact that Swiss Cottage is not in Switzerland - not counting the thematic economy of Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
However, the roof in Central Park calls carefully the magic experience, and it is in the meantime that two two-year-old kids will enjoy it, as well as two adult women.
If I could evaluate the roof, he would have served the maximum points, but no one is lucky.
This week I experienced a similar experience in the trade when I was requested to evaluate my "country" at a stage from one to five when paying a credit card.
In the coffee on the corner of my street, it's the same, with the difference that I can reach 15% for the evaluation of something that I'm buying for.
Not only that it disturbs otherwise sales, but the service is so needed to get into the pretty buyers if it isn't necessary.
A woman in the business was a smile about me when I was unnecessaryly assessed my transmission of credit cards to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from the hospital to the disease of herd.
This is already the subject that Pistorius had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated because of the rained wounds in the cave, which, according to the exhibition, caused himself to fall in the goal.
The Pistolus was accused of murder after a revocation against a criminal sentence for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steencampo in early ransom hours at Valentin in 2013, some shooting randoms through the door of the toilet box in his house in Pretoria.
The writer claimed that you had a little bit of her.

It's the first step to help the bow pand to protect this kind.
The 15-year-old Cchao-chao was released in the natural reservation at the beginning of the parking period on 11 March.
Thanks to the surveying equipment on the roof, the elders could watch every step.
She met her chosen Chao-chchao at 12 days of the past.
The cockpit with the pandish was a minute and a half and was successful.
It can also be a little miracle, because the bridges are not viewing the most successful love for animals.
Samicians are relatively wrongly considering the time when the samicis are ready, they are also often deceived and do not know what to do.
The young man was born healthy and, even because Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during the pregnancy, was estimated after the birth of 216 grams.
The average weight of the newborn pandy is 70 gram lower.
For illegal campaign in Greece, two Bullars were arrested

It depends on whether it gets an engagement until the start of the new year.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I should be worth it as at school, then three.
I didn't get too much for a year, I had a tested man before me.
I learned.
I started catching a second year.
Before the third season, I thought they gave me more space.
But they brought a new man with whom I was stuck again.
I assumed I'd always catch.
But during the ten inputs we may have got only five points, so the trainers started to run.
He's got my colleague at the end.
But that's what it's doing.
They wanted to keep him at the next season.
What was the life in Riz?
Great.
It's a little Prague.
Nice, European, historical city.
I'll miss it.
I found my girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're going to break next year.
So I brought something.
How probably is KHL for the architectural?
The first ten teams are quality.
Then there are men like us or Slovan who must change their heroes against them.
The conviction is on the other side, so you have to replace it.
That means playing back, more fighting.
I haven't seen a problem in the broadcast.
The Chapter is that the Russians want to play empty.
A few shoots, and even if she has a half-left row before herself, ra's playing.
In Czechland, it just shoots more.
Didn't you do a problem to travel and move over seven hours?
No one has a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in silence.
The program is a workshop so that you are playing four steps outside and then you have two days free.
How do Lotys put their club in KHL?
As a national team.
All Latvian follows hokey, together with basketball is a national sport.
They're all guys.
Although it didn't happen, many were walking.
Did Danim's action in KHL help that Latvia had almost passed into the quarter final on the aircraft of the world?
KHL plays since 2008 and Dinamo is there from the beginning.
And from the same time, their outcome to the world's mastership began to go up.
On Olympy 2014, in Soči, they fell in a quarter final with Canada at a time 1:2.
That was an inevitable result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to higher level.
More lottery players are still moved to Czech extraligi.
Roberts Bukarts was sentenced in Zlina and before signing with ́s is Ralfs Freebergs.
What do you think they're going so much here?
They're not any bathroom players, they're really quality.
More teams are looking for less and younger players from the coach, Lothish belongs to them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts three weeks ago.
Why are you still without an engagement?
At the beginning of February, I felt that I was going to continue in Riz.
We started looking for something in that fall.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have to talk to the man, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We were working with different teams that were decided in the final for someone else.
So I'm training home in Zline and waiting for something to happen.
You're not nervous?
I was four years ago when I went out of here and didn't know what it would be.
Current employment is not the best, on the other hand, I'm at the same time home.
I've rejected something in KHL, so I'm getting it different.
The question only sounds when and where I will sign.
How real is the variant that you're going to eat a new year old in Zline?
Everything can happen.
We'll see what's going on in a month where it's going to go.
Now I can just wait what the agent's doing.
Do you prefer a competition?
It wasn't a seat that I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's airport continues.
In January of the year, I've been in article S to care for a good businessman? I also wrote about the camp in Aeroplanes at Orlic.
The problem's base remains the same, so I'll allow the traveling passport to remember the article.
There's been a lot of years about the camp in the Latest.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it's probably the best when they look at the official site of the cultural memory of the Year.
In the historical review, the camp was two kilometers eastward from the country of the Year, since 8th 1940 he served as a camp, since 1 January 1942 he was a collective camp, and since 2.8.1942 he became a cicano camp.
The next text described the transition of life in the camp, including the Neilid subminans, until March 1943, when the first aircrafts were included in the vegetable transport.
On 4.5.1943, 370 persons were transported by the largest transport to the discharge camp.
They totally were 420.
Very strong story of imperfect human beings who have caused them to be human beings and the ideology.
There is no doubt that these events are necessary to continue.
There is no doubt that this should be played at a memory in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is else.
For socialism, the camp was sometimes forgotten, and in the 1970 ’ s, it was nearly placed on the part of the former camp.
The story of the camp was eventually discovered in 1992 in the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memory was discovered in the Years.
In the middle of the 1990 ’ s, the government promised the ransom and the destruction of the wind, but it happened.
In 1998 the memory was announced by cultural memory, and since 2009 his administration falls under the Memorial of Lidice.
In July 2013, the United Nations Committee for Human Rights invited the Czech Republic to close early.
That's so extremely fair about the military court of the camp.
On the basis of the government, the refund was approved and decided to be prepared to determine the price.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Government will first buy.
According to Herman Cultural Minister, "There are some numbers, but I would probably take the purposes if I went with them to the public."
We'll see what's gonna bring a professional trial.
According to some of the non-official estimates, hundreds of millions can be achieved, according to others, to billion.
Like that, in any case, it's an important matter.
In fact, just a few hundred metres from the former camp is a memory in which the state resources invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the United Nations Committee had fully financed all the transactions for human rights, which is obviously not threatening, it would be the same thing that I think it would have been to get out of money.
What does the government not have any other priorities?
A memorandum, a high-speaking place, stands the will of the practice without the nearby tragedy and whoever wants, there can be a memory of suffering and murdered.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's keep it as it's, and we'll keep the place with the maximum carefulness.
In this case, the Government of the Czech Republic, as well as the money of tax chargers, should be responsible for the responsible person, in this case of the Government of the Czech Republic, to take care of the right owner.
At least with such one as in your own company!
Of course, the Minister for Finance and the President of the Government is not a whole government.
But I also consider that the UN leader's movement is just as an empty pre-optional proclaimment.
For years in May, I was trying to look directly to the place.
Very fair income roads, adjusted parking, replicas of wooden bars.
In one exhibition, in the second integrated WC with fluid water.
A small natural amfiteatre with the possibility of session and with a view to its own swimming place, which is created from stones located in a mild swimming.
With flowers and flowers.
All attributes corresponding to the importance of this place, as it obeys and belongs.
It is currently conducting an archaeological research at the place of the p’s camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, parts of discovered foundations were not possible to preserve and at least visible access.
In this way, the Ministry of Culture of Daniel Herman could be able to toggle his efforts.
In the case of the Government to carry out the redemption for State money, it will only be a more distressing step in its so much problem in the Ministry of Culture.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may mix the symptoms of injury diseases (IBD)
For your feeding system, red meat and milk products may be by nightmare.
The new study, however, indicates the right pattern: food rich to animal protein and milk products could help to deal with the symptoms of infectionate heat diseases.
The untreated disease that affects up to 1.3 million Americans and 300.000 patients in the United Kingdom causes pain of breasts and blood addictions, loss of weight and extreme injury.
It is usually advised to not use meat and milk products to mix the symptoms. However, researchers of the Washington University have found that the essence amino oxide of tryptofan in protein helps to create immune cells that support the disorder of the ground.
Dr. Marco Colonna’s leader study explained that immune cells protect the tree and ensure the rebound of damage microbs from eating.
The beginning of the cells is calculated by the number of cells supporting the tolerants and protecting the body, without then harming the sensitive weight.
When the mixture of yours is on the side of the occupation, it can reach an embarrassing heat disease.
In the course of research, the students found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerances in the muscle with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the creation of cells the presence of tryptophane - one of the protein-building blocks.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a connection between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus re— which is part of the central microbio and the development of cells that support the body tolerants.
The more of the tryptophan in their food, the more they had these immune cells."
In addition, he suggested that if it is shown that it is the same for humans, then the combination of the L. re—i and the food rich to tryptofan would help develop more sensitive and less affective steel.
The postgradual research of Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas in the study of the exact type of immune cells supporting the body tolerants discovered that one group of muscle testing had these cells, while the second group of the same muscles were spent separately.
She rejected that one group of mouse has a separate stage of microbios - the community of bakteries, viruses and fibres that are currently residing in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse tree was tested by the DNA series method and researchers found six kinds of bacteria at the mouse with immune cells that shot the second group of mouse.
Mouses that were kept in sterile rubber and missed with microbios - so this type of immune cells - was given by the L. reppie bacteria - and created immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, researchers research L. reʹa in the liquid and then transfer a small quantity of weight - without bacteria - unexpected immune cells stored in isolation.
Immun cells were developed in a tolerant cell.
After removeing the active component from the fluid, it was shown that the product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-oct acid was adequate.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptofan in the mouse feed, the quantity of these cells increased by 50 percent. After the average dose of tryptophen, however, the half of the population of cells was decreased.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as the mouse and the one of us keeps the L. reʹa bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the continuous products of tryptophen from the L. re réi cause cell development in humans in the same way as in the mouse, but the defects in genes relating to tryptophen were detected in people with anxious heat disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us may have to effort to develop these cells because they control the inner surface.
The potentially high level of tryptophane in the presence of the L. reʹi bacteria can increase the population of cells."
José Mourinho considers a signature with Nienem Matić and its transition to Manchester United as a ‘genial’
Manchester United got into his "geny" team in the likeness of Nienja Matiće - at least that thinks José Mourin after the booker debuted in the middle contest against Sampdoria.
Matit, who signed with ≥ 40 million frees, was introduced in the first department in Dublin at 2:1 - the latest presidential challenge before the EUFA Superpower, where the United States meet with Real Madrid - and influenced his role of bookers by Paul Pogby and Andrease Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team of the presidential Asian tour, Matić had no form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinha, should be worked before the beginning of the next meeting of Premier League.
"There needs time, but it's a experienced, intelligent, and has a genial thought - thinking of Bala," said Mourin.
"We'll help him to get to the condition as soon as possible."
Similarly, as Matić, and his new partners Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukaku also played the first stage on Aviva Stadium and Mourinho starts quietly forming their eleven for the next.
The independent source this week notified that Mourinho wants to sign with other three players, but it takes care of that club's led a "fantastytic work" and brought to the team three of the four most important players.
"Thank the club for helping me get three of the four players," added.
"The four of the four would comfort me more, but I recognize they did the maximum for me."
Life call of the king of the corners of the skin Lady Hrušky.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This multi-sensitive image began to be drawn thanks to the new series of Prima Zdenkov Academy.
The crash just locked the chance.
"Look, I'd not sign this in your public academy because I think, my hand on the heart, I can learn much from you," he called him to the social network in the video.
And because these two have been shot for a few years, he didn't forget Lady to kill him this time.
"I can teach you a noise from a diet corner meat, a American worm or call you to water and show you why the favorite smoke shirt is," he murdered.
His ownness in Pohlreich's new show really thinks.
It's time to move to the high level and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss is about it," said Blesco.
But he didn't give up, because he took the new parts of his next order Yes, boss!
In fact, Krušky in the Kulinary Academy only reacted to Prima’s whole matter as his personal activity that goes outside the television.
Greatly, Greece Pohlreich ruled his first kitchen in 2004.
During a few days, it was sold over 300 thousand kitchens!
The new order that Prima presented last night to the sub-term sending scheme is an unfailed public school.
He chooses his jackets from a number of birds, and in twelve parts, he is familiar with twelve kitchen technicians.
In the latest work of his show Now the boss is running in November 2014, the Zdenek left the back of his trick to swallow the crossed crap.
If I had my face there, I'd have a lot of smile.
"And this horrible thing I'm just smiling - the crash is healthy fruit and has many vitamins," Lady reacted.
He's thinking about Lady's culinary art.
"Firning according to Lady Krušky doesn't come in mind or at home, because I'm not going to leave a gastropunk home," she said.
I appreciate Pohlreich's right hand, even according to I'm doing a cow on the middle.
In my order, but his receptions will not be determined," he didn't forgive Cross.
It's a fucking fucking fucking!
He's not a kitchen for me, it's a TV clown.
"The gastronomic analfabete or debil," Pohlreich said about Cross on one of the predecessors.
"I don't have twenty to get over them the hands, but I don't do it anymore," he reported on the account of the exhausted Greek wounds.
British finder uses a microchip in his hand to quit a car and a house of mave
The British finder became the first man in the country with a microchip directed to the body. The simple mouth of his hands can lock the door from the house and the office and even start the car.
Thirty-year Steven Northam has allowed a deep chip to implant between the palec and the indicator and now offers the same service by its company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their life.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anestesiologist of the hospital Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, monitoring and maintaining treatment procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted with dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service for the exchange of doors and cars in combination with microchips. The price of one lock is 300 £.
The married father of a child allowed him to integrate into his home and car BMW Z4, which starts a simple hand-moving.
Requisite of the White House remained tax payers for thousands of dollars
The decision of the White House to flee with the helicopter of the sea at South Lawn for the opportunity of celebration of the American production industry, which was done last month, came according to the records of the marine registration that the TIME week had issued, for $24,000.
Green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on the ground, was the top of the programme of 17 July in the White House, which was a overview of the American Programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and several high officers of the White House have watched the preview of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter from Connecticut was built near the jachto of the whisconsine, a carrier from the Wisconsin and a visible fresh car from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of a helicopter of some 36 hours before helicopter on the South Lawn arrived in the "immortal" event, introduced the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the units responsible for the helicopter management.
"I wanted to make sure you should have responsibilities for such a significant event," wrote Head of HMX-1 in the e-mail to his superior, the representative of the airport officer on the day before the start of the event.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn 17 July approximately at 7:00 to the opportunity of a review, which the beginning is planned at 15:00 and remains at the place until the full exposure of the entire place scheduled between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail continued to state that if it comes to the latest time when it goes out of the White House, the replacement premium will be sent for the years in the light of the working time Regulation.
The P's post remained at the evening with the helicopter and also with them a security work unit.
From the records - which received the week of TIME - was not clear whether the second post was finally sent.
Ha · Act prohibits the State officials in the use of government property to political members.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating the possibility of violation of this Regulation.
"We were interested in whether this was the Ha ́ Act destruction and we were assured that it was all right," wrote the commander.
"It sounds like you would be locked," replied the representative.
This view “Made in America” was marked by the White House as an official event, and the Act would therefore not be affected on it.
But even the official events have political subtexts.
In its response to the event, the Chairman promoted a health reform that passed through the senate and spoke about the effort of maintaining the Government Regulation.
The use of air carriers such as Marine One or Air Force One for Political Facilities is a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them in the traveling.
Their presence, however, is unusual for presentation.
Trump ordered control in February after the president's airport was eaten in the background at his first meeting in the campaign in Melbourne in Florida. His Twitter's charges for the use of the president's aircraft.
“The White House is pleased by the supervision of ‘Made in America’, which represented products from all 50 countries produced by Americans from American materials,’ said the representative of the print secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 helicopters often train the adventure in Washington and South Lawn and make events with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump at the beginning of July in Germany was a summit of the G-20 group, HMX-1 was conducted in the white House.
The Made in America was part of the current training train, introduced the State factor.
The helicopter unit on the same day passed in the "non-president support missions" in the next 11 hours.
The White House noted that the tax payers' money had no other recruitment.
The speaker Sikorsky noted that the company was not interested in the negotiations on the construction of helicopters to South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not store the budget records for the Presidency Years and the precise costs relating to the supervision are difficult to be determined according to the exhibition of maritimes.
According to the Defense Ministry, it makes an hour price for the financial year 2017, the refunds of the DoD expenditure for VH-3D $24 380 per year.
The entity records takes time 30 minutes from the basic Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginii and back.
The White House arguments that the operational costs of helicopters are significantly moved under that amount.
“Inducing the costs of tax chargers based on expenditure refunds is very valuable,” she said to all Walters.
“Thes include personal, maintenance and many other costs covered by each year.”
According to the RAND study of 2015, the replacement of the DoD costs does not include the cost of the staff, but include the fuel price, maintenance and contractual costs.
The current print secretary of the White House Sean Spicer was aware of the use of helicopters for views.
"The idea of the views that take place this week is to represent the products produced in the United States," Spicer said.
“I am true that Sikorsky and State Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defence of our state and that they provide jobs to hundreds, not to thousands of people.
I think, as the Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and the final military equipment in which the production shares not the beginning of American citizens.
This fact is worth recalling."
It doesn't matter if Trump was also looking at the helicopter at the South Lawn at his apartment. It is certainly possible to say only that he was sitting as a volant of one of the carriers.
Back in the White House Trump celebrated the representative of Sikorsky and met with the medium of its own product floots.
"Scorsky I know very well," said the President, "I am myself immediately three."
A young woman bought her in the bathroom at Mach's Lake, the police bought her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday, about the second hour of the ransom.
Instead of buying, but she remained in prison in mystics.
When she decided to ask the phone for police help, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"From that way the police had lost the connection soon," reported the police speaker Ivan Balák.
A few police guards were described in the place that she described around, but finding a young woman was not easy.
"Some of the police must have been brodited with a hundreds of meters of coasts before they felt a strong land again under their feet," Balak approached.
And like that, she was also sinned.
The police were guided according to the direction of her calling for help.
"To not come about at least this connection, they agreed with her that it would be a vote to count," said the speaker.
Policies found a woman until three quarters to five in the villages in Berny.
She continued physical and psychical forces, and she made signs of the heat.
That's why her appealed health was transferred to the Czech Republic of Czech Republic.
Connecting Grandpa to STAN?
It's a sale girl from the woman's requested.
It's a little ironic.
His web project is searching.cz as a billion electors in principle said STAN suffers the deficiency of obedient people.
He also claimed that the political failure of the party is less known as concerns and independents, in fact, it does not have a whole-statal programme for screening.
Her electoral candidate just after talking to Grandpa becomes an obedient man, let any political view.
Sometimes he started this way, Vit Bart, and it wasn't really good.
His honour to the obedient people and persons that may be replaced by candidates, as well as some concerns, which also allowed Gazdik, and the favorite argument of the Boss STAN that the highest value of movement are just political checks and experiences of an age, traditionally the most popular policy and according to investigations.
You are now quietly focusing on the assembly of unknown persons.
The total divorce with humans, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdik also explained that the movement does not want to lose his identity on the candidates.
But if STAN from the identity has already understood only a little, after Grandpa's arrival, and only a game to identify.
Not only Gazdik murdered against the United Nations Andrey Babische, but the Grand Baby, who is publicly praising, said: "My goal is to move the United Nations, then the movement of the Starosts has gained twenty percent."
Let's hope you haven't pulled the move.
The child is a successful businessman and a billioner is certainly not a case.
It often speaks about politics like Grandpa, in a segregate, but it holds its own political mark.
The STAN has already performed more reality show than the political side and the Grandpa's hand as if she would do more from the requested girl.
Sometimes STAN went with TOP 09, then with humans, and now he looks for people who are obedient to change.
Let's hope that someone's upset.
Police dogs shouted in Moscow by a whirlman.
The dogs specialised for explosions and feeding dogs today have thrown up at the Most sea with a wrestling.
The police dog should not be scared and fearful, said the leader of the police architects of the Usteck country of Peter Tomasek.
The police dog's suit's been spent for two years.
At Moscow, they used the growth of the dogs, so those who just progress in education.
According to the standard education that had to discover in the lake around the east of the output patterns and look for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to be cut into the wheel and passed over the sea.
I'm saying, it's to test dogs in the wheel.
So as soon as the whirlman gets, the dog could go to work so that he could not have a problem with the way of the wrestling.
"The chief's worth, the dog's going and soon looking for," said Tomásek.
The dog that is insult or on the road is not able to start working immediately is exhausted from the education.
"The majority of them, for example, leave them in the garden," added Thomas.
Police has 76 dogs with different specialisations in the West country.
The German sheep are controlled, but the sheep of the Belgian.
The word about Others cares about the snow.
"He's getting him alone, preparing him for the service that the dog's going to do for us," Tomasek added.
The animal shall be carried out by repeated veterinary investigations that may discover appropriate health hedicics.
The dog is healthy and inappropriate, makes the first tests in 20 months.
"It's about two and a half to three years," added Tomasek.
The length of police service depends on the health status of dogs.
Most of them serve in eight to ten years.
Then he gets his songs.

According to the United Nations, the Afghanistan Democracy is committed to women in politics
The options may only be acceptable when all members of the company, including women, have been involved in the United Nations representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, leader of the United Nations Help Mission, said that the elections in local representatives with hundreds of women, three women are concerned about the post of the Vice-President and more than 30 per cent of newly registered electors are women.
"The role of a woman cannot be overseen," he stated in his central declaration.
Options may be completely representative and reliable only if women are involved, as well as all related processes relating to elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are made on 5 April.
Taliban published a number of disputes against the electoral process that moves the international war activity on the second trip.
In the aerodrome elections, one democracy-elected government first transfers its power to peaceful followers of the Government.
Haysom noted that the strong role of women strengthened the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghanistan independent electoral committee noted that of the total 3,6 million walkers registered by 1,2 million women.
The unicode beer will be burning a beer again.
For a good beer in a newly resurrected bird.
The surprise and honesty of the new owners returned to the life of a bird in Lobči in Mshana a few years ago.
The pivovar at the first place in 1586 has renewable nuclear, and in the nineteenth century, it was stopped to a parostrophic operation.
She followed the floor years when the bird was mostly dark birds.
Despite the Second World War, the production was stopped and in 1984 the bird was nationalized.
Since that time, the buildings of the State ship served.
The work of the convictions was done by the owners of the bird after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and devastated on the building material.
In 2007, however, the new rubber of new owners, Jany's and Paul Prousov's teachers.
They started building with maximum respect for the spirit of building and every detail.
They were carefully trained and studied the materials, trying to maintain pneumatic materials and building elements.
The bird has the same image as in the nineteenth century when she started his golden era.
Their work was evaluated by the statement of a bird for the cultural memory of the Ministry of Culture, and the building also became part of the European Road of Industrial Heritage.
In 2015, the traditions of public beer were also renewable.
If you want to buy a great lobby bird in the Male Cocorynska region, please invoke the exhibition in the bird area.
When the bird is born here, it uses cocourian water in the protected country, sweet from the lobby fields and the jacked cloud.
You're stucking a traditional light bed, but also dark beer and specials.
And don't let you go out of the watch of the bird, he's going on on Sunday and Sunday, and half the second.
The biggest workshop for the Czech Slovenia?
One of the biggest certainty of his type in the world?
Such a unique building should have been the stability of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Jacler, on the top of the territory of the village of Baby.
It had to create it up to twelve bunkers associated with the vast subterranean.
There should have been headquarters, cash, munice, material, electricity, machinery and sickness.
But the establishment ended the Mnichov Agreement.
In the past year, he was able to set up the only powerful iron bunker and the underground Chambers were spread.
Thanks to the above areas of the Spolka Stachelberg, who started rebuilding a unique building at the beginning of the ninety-years, you can see here.
The underground is already available from 75 percent!
The part of the area is besides the T-S-shooting rub with the exposure and subterranean, and the weaponsed object of easily covering, along with two distressed cups, throats and learning roads of Revelated Trutnovska.

Get the plant with one click.
Students with the creation of herbs and the usual loved plants will help a new free Pl@ntNet.
When they're interested in what plant they've just got on the scatters, they'll advise them.
The only thing they'll have to do is to photograph the plant and itself recognises what kind it is about.
New Yee, available for iOS and Android, was represented by the representative of the Centre of Ethical and Environmental Education in the Brotherslav Hores Park in the Secret Life of the City.
The project was also involved in 50 Czech and Slovenian schools, which photographed and added plants from their surroundings.
The new outcome French is free to stand on the town's Secret Life on the sides.
The goal of French developers was to contribute the most people to their photographs, and thus increased the growth of plants that would be able to spread.
"Before children who hold tablets or cells in their hands, they can go into the forest," said the coordinator of this project Ivan Polonski.
On the basis of sufficient quality photographs of flower, sheet or plant plants can be able to expand its name during a few seconds, which then in Czech and Slovenian adds under the photo.
The French have allowed us to translate the town's secret life to the project to Slovenian and Czech.
It is therefore welcome to contribute to the plant images that are not yet available in the database.
"The French will evaluate whether it is available and then add it to the database," informed the Poland.
Furthermore, GMB on investment in McVitie's company in Glasgow
The committees require the assurance of the manufacturer's manufacturer's complaint to McVitie's production commitment in the fabric in Glasgow.
The Scotch committee GMB concluded that the company is still silent about the eventual investment in the company in Tollcross.
In fact, he works more than 500 employees who produce other products and hobnob and Rich Tea.
Majitor McVitie's, Pladis, noted that in the past few years she invested in more than 5 million dollars.
She added that the employees and representatives of the committee would be "from the first informed" in the case of changes in the operation.
In the letters of the building company, the Scotch Committees of GMB assured that McVitie's "s will not be made to their promises on the financing and modernization of production lines".
The GMB Drew Duffy organizer added: “The fact that we have missed a response from the builder on the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very concerned for our members.
Many families and employees worked here with a local community and Glasgow, where the work in the present case represents a critical employment pillar in a highly unemployment and social division.
From the view of work, payments and prosperity - and despite the view of Brexit, the costs of life and losing late production - the east part of Glasgow is a prospering producer, such as McVitie's."
Pladis’ speaking company said: “Tollcross has received a letter from GMB just yesterday and the company gives a statement as soon as we appreciate the continuing commitment to employees and representatives of the Committee.
The regular meeting with the employees and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross occurred two months ago and the meeting was openly discussed with many problems.
We have spoken to the employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic undertakings, we appreciate our operation on regular basis, which is paid for all our operations, and they could continue to purchase successfully to the final.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million freers in Tollcross, especially in production lines and operation defectives.
We appreciate the inheritance of Tollcross and more localities and, in the case of any change in the operation, the employees and representatives of the Committee will be informed immediately."
Did PSG Barcelon warn about Neymara's move three years ago?
La Liga will be able to suffer his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymara to get on his side after 189 million £, so the amount needed to buy Neymara from sâa, but warned this French team of Barcelon about his recording income three years ago?
This sensitive transition has developed the waters of the years of transition. The Ligue 1 club is ready to convince more than twofold before the record amount of Paul Pogby's transition to Manchester United, who paid for 89 million £ in the latest.
After confirming and finishing the transfer, Neymar will become the lovers of the world's best player and, at the same time, the best payable professional sportsman in the world - after the opinion, the PSG team will be collected over 500 000 £ per week.
Barcelona is devastated by the way Neymar was exhausted from his companions, despite the confidential resource confirmed that the club tried to Neymar in all cases from his arrival from Santos in 2013.
Has the Balance World, however, been warned by the President of the PSG three years ago?
When Manchester City was interested in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the clubs that would be interested in interrupting one of the best PSG players.
"I'm afraid, because when someone's trying to get one of our players, then we'll certainly celebrate one of their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to get one of our players, they'll be successful."
It seems that Barcelona exceeded the mental border when she was interested in PSG Marca Verratti in the year.
The PSG was expressed in the sense that in any circumstances, the Italian representative would not allow the department. So it is likely that Barcelona for its cruel negotiation now with Neymara's department covers a bitter pill.
Who explains the sanction?
Has political criminality widely comprehensive rules?
Donald Trump shot the anti-Russian sanction.
On the day before, the United States took the sanctions to the Venezuelan President Madura.
And on the day before, Trump wrote that China doesn't do anything with the North Korean threat and that it's not going to go.
It's a cleaner idea of the sanction as a flame from the boat.
These things can't be able to get into one pitch.
Madura's Venezuela actually went on the road to the diâturie, a totality.
China just keeps it like the American president would like.
Russia's alone for herself.
But if anybody wants to strike that even a running elector, a American, European or another, he understands what it is in and what the rules system is to be covered by the sanction policy, it would be unfairly impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, the President Trump only affects what the President Obama has already said, just gave it the executive course.
So why's that breaking?
Loni feared that if he wins the American choices of Trump, let's go with Putin and revoke the sanction.
It's a terrible imagination.
But it's once in practice.
The Trump doesn't release the sanctions, but they're throwing up.
But Europe's more fearing.
The German Ministry of Zypries says that Trumpo sanctions violate international law.
It's like the pack is only the sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council?
Then they are not coshers or anti-russian sanctions of the EU.
The Boss of the European Commission Juncker reacts that Trompo sanctions threaten the energy security of the EU.
It's like they should use sanctions just so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
The remote walker's gone.
Three years he heard that the court of anti-russian sanctions depended only on the fulfilment of Mine Conventions on the Affairs on Ukraine.
Now it is evident that it is about the energy security of the EU.
The whirlman's widespread.
They're coming to Russia for the sanction that it's too mounted there he doesn't have.
China's lost because it's a little mount.
The Venezuelan President is condemned because he builds dictature in its country.
All these crimes or only the attention of their rationality.
But do you see any system, or rules?
Andrej Babich: I don't think about cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crossed the Republic with his vicarious book and finished the election program.
Besides the Pardubian country, all candidates are ready.
According to his words, no one was expressly involved in them.
He even agreed to carry out the seasonal leader and the ANO Ivo Vondrák school minister.
"When it is successful, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a lawyer, or a leader," he confirmed his former advice.
Many representatives and national policies have hurt your concern that the direct choice of business and recipients should be conducted by strangers and cities themselves, only with managers.
Do you really think that?
So it wasn't.
I'm a recipient of direct democracy, we love the President directly and I'm convinced that the elders and the recipients should also be elected.
I'm not talking about the disruption of representatives in my book, they can be quietly there.
The question is how much it will be.
When I present your book about what I'm sleeping when I'm sleeping, I've heard your ears that you've spoken about the cancellation of the representative.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about the direct choice and reducing the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five and 51 representatives.
Praise with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the recipient is estimated that she has not set up and prepared large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same applies to the government that only two people, Klaus and Zeman, were conducted in our history.
So I don't say they did it well.
The current president doesn't do anything, he just moderates the debate.
That can't work.
That's why you want to run the system?
It'd be ideal, but it's hard to do it.
We only have a change in the program to a single choice to the Senate.
We have also made a clousing mandate of Ministers and the correction of the acting rules to prevent the unfair exhibition of missions that are able to work mainly in the Commissions and Committees, not to lead to the meetings.
Of course, it is not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opposers do.
That as a dictator you will lead to the government, control with 101 members, distort the countries and Senate, and by the way of thankful concerns and recipients, you will control the whole country.
I'm sure that's not.
But there's nothing wrong to discuss the number of businesses.
The French President Macron announced the reduction of the third legal assembly, where there are 57 thousand French legislators, while it is 17 thousand Czech.
However, no one commits the threat of democracy.
Even if someone wins elections in Czech, we have mechanisms that would prohibit him to make the same dramatic changes.
The waters for those who have a parliament are large but are sufficient to look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like this is threatened by the UN's movement.
We're just a team that will work in the government for people, not for our partners or resorts.
I don't understand why we could not agree that only the payment of factors, employees in culture and social services is increased.
Why have I been voted and added to 21 percent of GIBS members who have already taken 60 thousand now?
Would you like to do that as a premier?
The Premier is going to take place when the ministers cho's unexpectedly, the government with the journey of the office and for the money of the state would be undertaken as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers have no idea in the government, they're able to speak outside her.
It must go to the cabinet, and there is no place for coalition solutions, power voting and kschefty, where it is to decide.
How do you want to have a team when ministers cho's mainly pages?
There is a Constitutional Law on the top of the sides.
When the bread was broken, the Sabbath said that the coalition is not payable, and he threw the grandmother out of the government.
This can be done by every premier.
But it's personality, and it's a ability manager, a similar gesta plan doesn't need.
He measures all the same and requires the perfect performance of all.
You know who you would propose to the Minister for Finance?
I'm not thinking about it, we're not going to be in that government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
So many skepses are not in place.
Ancients have received the business officer of Grandpa, who would cooperate with you, may win you the wheel of Jiří Chunk.
I don't think so.
CHSSD guides Lubomir Zaorálek, which does not exclude the ONU coalicy, may be conducted by Václav Klaus ml, which is also against.
I'd leave it on the walkers.
Vicepremier and president of the United Nations Richard Brabec said you had a lot of common points with the SPD Tommy Okamury, for example in economic.
So the okamors are looking forward as a coalia partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political story, candidated as a Witness Barty for VV, and then received money from the Wisvic for his company, running there a shot.
Of course, he's a distinct person.
Well, it's sometimes crazy.
When I take his program, there is a wide involvement in the management of the company, direct democracy, that can be agreed.
I don't ask you about that.
I'm interested in whether there is a pleasant man who has xenophobia's views, speaking on demonstrations with snippets and wanting to get out of the EU?
We don't think about cooperation with Mr. Okamury, I can't imagine it.
It is obvious that he went to politics to benefit from it.
And what is the peaceful support of the communists of your minor government?
I can't imagine that, but the choices.
It's about negotiating a winning with another in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who is the two.
Of course, it is important to be able to agree with the Coalition Government programme.
Let's go back to your trying to drive the state as a company.
But the government has to run, the Prime Minister of Saturday left everything out, never decided.
Coalitions such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
Because the Sabbath is his shit, and I think it was also the reason he dropped me out.
As soon as he did it, Chiez controlled the Czech government.
It is, however, incredible that the Prime Minister has made a resolution written by the CEZ management, which provides to the Ministry of Finance, how to vote on the Valley CEZ.
If you'd become a primary, would you change your personal conditions in the supervisory advice and exchange the top management of CHEZ?
Jesus, if I'm a Prime Minister, he'll see it.
I'm not yet.
It seems that the CHEZ has sent signs in your direction.
Good cooperation with the CSSD would have been to be better with the UN.
So, maybe everyone's going on on the choices again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any lobbys of Poverty or Rubik, I'm a single unit and I'm not going to solve this.
Then answer it directly.
When you stand in the head of the Government, will you try to change the management of CHEZ, the Czech TV or the General Health Security, then the institutions you criticize?
I would like the Chiz to be a transparency company.
He's been doing what he wanted for all years, and I'll give it to traditional political parties.
It's enough to check Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he's going to stand in the Chiz majority, he's never ordered him, he's just there to the number that's wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
CHEZ must take Dukovany, evaluate them, take them into the daughter company, arrange funding, make additional competition or get coinvestor and set a new nuclear block.
The concept that State has to finance and create new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech TV?
Some of her orders against me lead to a permanent campaign, but I don't have any power to remove someone.
But to control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that the citizens pay for public law and television payments are about 7,2 billion per year, but they do not know how these institutions are economically.
How do they don't know?
However, the Summit approves the report of their economics, which has direct impact on the positions of the General Directors of the CTU and the CR.
See how these messages are being negotiated, on the super powerful Pack of Saturday Kalousek that worked.
It applies to the current parliamentary committee to the outcome of the investigated writings, so to the lex Babiš.
And the Sabbath was so stupid that he had allowed Kaluski to touch me out of the government, which gained the TOP 09 percent, but the CSSD dropped them.
They're afraid of the destruction of their corruption system, and so they're talking about the threat of democracy by Baby.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles described how the first president of the UN Jaroslav Faltínek builds a powerful territory by reaching the son of the Surveillance Council of Teplaren Brno and arresting the accused lawyer of Glyne's Bluetoshlov with City and State firms, such as the Prague Transport Business or the Czech Roads?
There's a permanent disaster in it.
I don't like it, and I've been counting him sometimes.
Faltinek arguments that the lawyer referred to is working to a substantially lower rates and is susceptible.
I wouldn't do that.
As a minister of Finance, I didn't have anyone.
We, in addition to the socans, never had corruption, no Pelt, Kratochvile, Britain.
We've had a customer sign, we've just removed such a man.
In this direction, I'm uncomfortable.
If something like that happens, we'll get anybody out, it's just one who would be.
