It's just a little mistake.
It's just a little back.
It's just a temporary solution.
It sounds anxious right.
It sounds strange for me.
It sounds very pleasant.
It's our obligation to help.
It's done between us, give me the ring back!
It's perfect.
It is anxious for people to assume that our task is to do what can be done only God.

It's time to go forward.
It's time to sleep.
It's time you're not waiting anymore.
It's Tom's phone.
It's too clear.
It's too slow!
Don't be sure, that's the best method.
