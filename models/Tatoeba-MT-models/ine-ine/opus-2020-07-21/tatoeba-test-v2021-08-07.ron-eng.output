It's just a little back.
It's just a temporary solution.
It sounds anxious right.
It sounds strange for me.
It sounds very pleasant.
It's our obligation to help.
It's done between us, give me the ring back!

It's time to go forward.
It's time to sleep.
It's time you're not waiting anymore.
It's Tom's phone.
