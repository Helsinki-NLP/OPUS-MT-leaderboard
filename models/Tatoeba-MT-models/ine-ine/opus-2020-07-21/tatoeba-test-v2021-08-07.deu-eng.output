The main assignment of the kings was to create a grave times from which it was thought that it would seem so untimely as the stars would seem over the sand of the time in which the rest of all was. The planning of the afterlife was more important than the life itself, which was only the way there. Wars led to the walls of this grave, in which the rocks were cut off. Of course, many things were regained, and at the later time even killed that had not been found.
