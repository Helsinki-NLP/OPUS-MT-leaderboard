Because of the energy obtained by the water atomy (or their sliding) to develop more heavy elements, the stars produce light and warmth.
Scientists have to create a reacter that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult task to resolve and they will need a lot of years before we see the building of synthesis reacters.
The steel is maintained on the surface of the water due to the surface pressure.
The reason for surface pressure is that the water molecules of the surface of the water are strongly added to one to another more than to the air molecules above them.
The water molecules create an invisible skin of its surface, which allows things, such as the igle, to float up.
The egg of the modern Property has a double bowl with deep in the middle of the middle. Two bottles provide more ice creaming, even at the screen.

This allows the square to switch. If the square moves to the left, the squeater switches to the left if the screens move to the right, the squeater switches right.
They must be delivered from the additional energy receiving from the light to return to their previous energy level.
They do this by ejecting small parts of light, photos.
This process is called by the scientists "stimulated radiation exhibition" because the atoms are stimulated from the light light, causing the exhibition of the light, and the light is a kind of radiation.
The next photo shows atomics. Of course, these are much smaller than those on the picture.
The photos are less than the material that builds the atoms!
