Biden leads the looks in three keylines
Only 100 days of choice, Joe Biden, Democracy, is used in three important swifts.
CNN reports today that Biden was over in Florida, Arivana and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden has 51% against 46% of the Chairman.
In Arına, 49%-45% of Biden will and in Michigan, it leads to the overburn of Biden, where it leads to 12 steps, 52%-40%.
To win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all of these riches to us, and actually more.
Trump in these days, with the coronary experts that the nationals teach him in the meantime, and say that most of the longer questions have been wronged, or very bad at the beginning of the age.
In addition, Trump has exposed badly from the contrasts and injuries that were exposed to George Floyd’s bathroom.
Trump and his manager have misuse or wronged them.
In order to corrupt Trumps, he is now under a severe prejudice to have ordered all the counterparts to breathe in towns where citizens or defense managers are Democrats.
If it has created a splendid distress between the cities and the wrath is overtaken to other Americans.
The pictures of the entire counterparty to kick the counterparts in unmarket cars have not yet been placed in the United States.
The Lincoln Project is just aware of this, but it can be seen below.
Trump envisaged three years in 2016, but with very small reactions.
Trump actually had a lot of rubbers with a small rate and enhanced the choices with mining.
For example, Michigan sold him with only 10.704.
It's less than 0.5% inhabitants.
Near all the views that the political reporters say are to show the same consequence, Biden is a progress.
The new CNN recognition in Arõna shows that the Presidency of Biden has now come from the cross-border education.
The CNNs and Quinnipiac schools of Florida are the same.
More to say, Fox News, who are well-to-right and described on support with Trump 2016, have shown the same material in their middle.
The last hope of the Chairman, the results of the questionnaires, is that Trump has hope of repealing important positions within the swiftry if the attention in the electoral ability is actually based on the economic.
The United States Economy took a severe depression in the Covid-19-school, but the carriers don't seem to be connected to the economy of the coronation.
It is, most of the chiefs seem to be taught Trump that we have been wronged to respond to the coronary elder, but trust him better to have the economic accident that is at this time.
However, Trump has failed to control the discussion in the electionality.
In the neighborhoods that have nearly logged together since the news of the film was unreasonable, where four police officers joined George Floyd, Trump tried to control the discussion of its police and its importance.
Law and Order, they became his identity.
It seems to have been wrong now, just as he said before.
Following that the viewers find more on Trump, most of the Republicans are likely to tell Trump and explain the support of Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without a special name.
Therefore, they make a convention in the United States to carry out many choices on the same box.
This can simply indicate the other group in the presidency of the carrier, and let it be one and one of the values for all the other offerers of the group to be identified.
This is the most effort of the Republication Group to be able to turn away from the crash of Trump and get self-determined results in the choices.
Olympical injection in Dakar was tested until 2026
The olympical infections should have occurred in Dakar next year, but they have now been tried up to 2026 because of the coronary age after the International Olympics and Senegal agreed with it.
However, the first olympical trial in Africa is a cause for many young people.
Manufacturer of Bruna in Nantes
In the Nantes Church in France, a personal messager has been handled in connection with firewaters that destroyed the church.
Le Monde has observed that the wound, a refugeer from Rwanda, who worked as a church overseer, had admitted to have burned the fire.
In conversation with another family, the human lawyer says that the man seems to be greater than his works.
In the middle of the destruction in the fire, the history of the church’s windows was the origin of the 17th century.
The message, who is 39 years old but has not been called as a name, was held at the end of July 18, and he was so dismissed.

It is well taken to me in the house of Balthasar and the Christian Samper in Copavogia.
My visit is a new picture view of Balthasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on 1 August in the Little-Kambi of the Snowlands.

Great and deep pictures of boys earlier than an e* of a fluid; an oil on one, shade birds on another.
From the work office, the home garden is released.

"The guest works much better than a machine on these tops and tops we have."
Mireya is with us, the Christian and Balthasar, and she tells us how her works are involved with the works here.
“Installations, joints of paper-works and score cultures.
They're very white and contrary to what dad's doing, where I'm working with the light and so," she says.
“ This was a year later.
Then I was assigned to work and had the desire to show there, but they were found in Tokyo out of Covid.
When my dad was started to talk and I saw where he was going, I repeatedly thought my part," says Mireya, but the Balthasar's works have strong baptized in the islandic national stories of women and women.
“ When I saw that my dad was doing this matter with the guys, I felt the opportunity to do a lot that is related to them, ” Mireya says, “but she worked with Sigurd Inga Bärna's son of gold in the Sign business.
"So I'll make the insertion out of the map."
In the last year, Mireya saw a vision of 72 lists of Academy's appeal in Snowland, such as Hl'Hl'un in Little-Kambi, and found the building of the whole country.
“This is a new, old load that is newly uploaded, ” says Mireya, but she came there to Baldvina Sverristochter, a letter student, who raised Mireya and Balthasar a vision.
“ She wanted us both to show, and we thought:
“Why not?
It's a good idea."
Balthasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and was assigned to the Listhall School in Barcelona before he was on a worldwide journey to study a listing and sometime studies.
He arrived here in 1961 in Iceland, and he was healed by country and nation.
There he returned shortly later, known to his wife, Christjana, and has lived here in the same way since 1963, in 57 years.
Balthasar is a decadesful lister, has maintained twelve individual visions, and shows with Christlike views.
He is known for his large wall images, where he can be called a wall wall stream in the Flatey Church and a fresh church in the Watchtower Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bitran Iceland and no other place, ” says Baltasar.
“ You low the sun and these shadows that slow down and slow down.
In the way I came here, I thought, "Wow, here is possible to work."
Mireya is the elderly children of Christjana and Balthasar, born in 1964.
"It was one thing I knew, it was really clean, that I wasn't going to be a picturelist," she asked if she wanted to feed her parents' feet.
“When I went to the educational and natural discipline at school, I did everything I could to get out of this.
So I realized that I was running.
Then you just have to get up," Mireya said and clothes.
She, like her father, has shown a delight in the world.
Many in Japan, to imagine.
All the children of Balthasar and the Christian have found the listway.
"I call this virus," says Mireya.
"There was no way out of this."

When you are talking about, when you are inside the cousin, it is not the choice to go this way.
It's clear in my mind that this wouldn't happen.
I think it's very clear, in my mind, that our men entered into a worst area of what this touched, "Asmund says.
He will not say that other companies will go the same way as Icelandair.
"You also see now a dangerous discussion that it is only normal to go up to this system to remove this right and that I am totally the opposite."

At least twelve employees have held at least two networks with business officers in the last days.
Those who had been witnessed that the stories said that the American Americans had in "vinial" tons made the point that the United States wanted to prevent northern Stream 2 would be real.
"I think this is a very, very serious threat," said one of the thirds with the German family.
These resources are in accordance with the statement of Mike Pompeo, abroad the American adviser, last week when he warned that businesses that participate in the work would be the best to "come out now" or have a threat to comply with 232 parts of the traditional law of Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
Furthermore, the Russian orchrist Gazprom, which has a monitoring of the development of the work, participate in the five European companies.
The French company Engie, OMV from Eastern, the British-Netherlands enterprise Royal Du Shell ́ Wintershall and the Uniper from Germany.
In the context of World on Sunday, the company's last name said that the American experiences to bury “important investment” were clearly involved in Europe's integrity.
Before the week ago, the United States Agency agreed to amend the legislation on landscape aimed at developing the United States refusal operations, which participated in the establishment of the Russian Northern Stream 2 Guideline.
In accordance with one of the carriers of the ships, the ships, the security, the remote station or the connection services for such ships, or those who offer witnessing to North Stream 2.
Both European and Public Employers have repeated their disapproval of the United States' experiences to change the European energy by providing the convictions of North Stream 2 and some of them have even called that Brussels works for data.

Supports more of the transport of public organs out to country
Communities and children's officers are able to move several of the public authorities out to the country next.
The Brunavarn area of the House and Human Agency will be moved north to South Africa to the decision of the Governing Body, but experts in the front of the Department have already shown that they will not be moved to the north.
In the Sprengisend on the Bigoon tomorrow, the One Dadason Son, official and childhood, said that it would be important for the building of the land that there are transported public structures.

My view is, and has always been, that we have to act in rapid actions to make the public better," says Assmund.
"We see that our neighbors, Northern and Danish have done this with good results."
He is convinced that the majority of the nations wants to see more movement on the public organs on the earth.

He takes examples of transportation of the Food Agency to Selfoss, Iceland Landscape to Akraness and Employment Insurance on Skagaströn.
“ This is a job at Skagastrond today, which is very important for the community.

Washington - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former chief of the American Medicinal and Medicinal Institute, warned on Sunday that it would be "very difficult" for a school example to open a new student if the coronary is unexpectedly in this community.
“I think school officers are everywhere to see how the divorce is within the community.
If the virus is disrupted in the community, it will be very difficult to open in that situation, “Gotlieb said in “Face the Nation”.
Since the next weeks the leadership of Trump had encouraged a schoolman to open his school for students and offer training in schools for five days a week.
However, these trials of President Trump and Minister of Education, Mr Betsy DeVos, came weekly after Trump warned that the Coronel Research would probably be “forwarded before he was baptized” and confirmed that school exhibition was in the situation where the situation was worse to test school opening for a few weeks.
However, on the fifteenth day, the mediums of the judges gave advice on how to open school for students.
In the guidelines, inter alia, the remoteness of people’s security, friends and employees is advised to use faces and to turn them into a deteriorated group of people in the schools.
However, the Mediterranean Reviews did not give up to school officers when they should closure schools if the Coronal Mediterranean has been “inconsistent ” as Godlieb says.
“When this unconscious state has not been considered to be open to schools, I think that more parents will go carefully, ” he says.
"This is why I think it is very important to get more information about which of the medical standards are almost unfairly, which did not give in their guidelines."
Godlieb said a school example should be considered as parts of accurate interactions in the community, local extension and testing when decisions are taken about whether to keep schools open or to change all things in the network education.
If between 5 and 10 per cent of the reports is a significant consequence of "the matter to fail" but more than 10 per cent is "the deterioration when considering is needed hard to end school judges."
“This is a sign that the ship has been able to be foot in the community, ” said Gottlieb, and it added that this would do parts of Florida World, which are the weakest coronary actor in the United States, were difficult to open for education in schools in the next month.
More than 30 ° C and Co ́periada, but the weakness of the worst farmer is in the sunlight of the South America.
However, Godlieb said that it would be a sign that it would be started to reduce the number of cases in some riches, including Arõna and Texas.
But despite Godlieb had said that it would be “intelligent signs” that it would have gone to the age of some riches in the sun-wall, it was going to “shoot in the cols” in the colds, including South-Karolina, Alabama, India and Illinois.
Many managers have set rules to deal with people to use the general districts and have enabled a re-opening purpose to strike with the expansion of the coronary division.
Godlieb said that → should consider closing children, limiting numbers of people at the provisions, closing films and remote locations that offer pleasure in the house and setting rules on the use of the rational use of the risks that make riches are able to recover the extreme limits that we set at the beginning of the age of March.
Furthermore, some have committed a crucial use of various businesses have committed people to use face responses.
The McDonald's Scanner is the latest company to make the use of face-defence and added to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks, and more of those who have set their own rules on the use of a grid.
Godlieb said that he had advised that more companies would take up a family, especially where the danger is determined.
"If we can actually have a control on the age when the wind goes into the garden until we get a drug or some kind of drug that changes the clinical way of this trial, we can do it with a cruel, it is absolutely simple, something that we can do, but that does not change exactly our life and allows us to keep what is very important for us, as to keep some business open and come back to school," he says.

The former soldier wants to see exactly what they have put out of the border, such as their good work.
Stott said: “I feel what happens there is no deterioration of what we read in the clouds, except now in the inside boat."
"There is a story who says of, but there is no doubt that this is from them."
"I think this is just another attack on them, just like the clouds that persecute them."
"I realize that they are in the field light and people want to know what they are doing, but I wanted that it would be more aware of all the good they have done and their good work, better than their personal matters."
"Now, of course, they will never be delivered from it, because of their situation."
Sussex’s support of the army and heritage showed another member of the king’s family that there was a special doctor in the story of the king’s family.
Dr. Kate Williams said to Sky News that the king’s family had not been able to use the stars of Harry Prince and Meghan Markle in their debt.
She thus added that the rulership within the king’s family would be fixed, but it could not be controlled by the interests of the general.
She said: “The reality is that all that they did to support the Queen had an assignment to look at the other members of the king’s family, and this was a problem. ”
"They're amazing friends."
"They were with less wedding than most sisters in the same situation, Andrew was with a wedding, and Anne was also with a wedding."
"But although the wedding Harry and Meghan were less in the areas than in Wilhelm and Katrina, the newsport was likely, because of the great interest of the world building on the par."
Donald Trump admits that he is often looking after his exposure on Twitter
Donald Trump has acknowledged that he often looks at Twitter's illnesses.
In consultation with Barstool Sports on Friday, the President of the United States said that his inconsistent repairs on Twitter facilities – which some have contained materials from white sex care – in most difficulties.
When the journalist Dave Portnoy asked him whether he looked after his feedback, Trump answered: “Out, too often.
It was so old before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very great.
You put it on your board, and then you came back next day and said, "Oh, what am I glad that I didn't send this?"
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out soon, we feel wonderful, and then you get a call - "Do you really say this?"
I'm saying, "What is this?" and you're getting different."
In the last month, the Trump was very angry after repairing the injection (sealed from the calculation) with a picture of its supporting people in the Villages area in Florida, where age couple called "White power" or "motive white".
And in 2017 Trump repeated three-year movements that were made to muslims, shown by Jaydu Fransen, leader of the Britannica First.
The President told Portnoy that the restorations that had come to him were most troubled.
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t investigate it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what's on the help that is small and that you don't increase it, sometimes — I have realized that there are almost always the repairs that come to a man in trouble. ”
The Chairman often shares glory to himself, dealing with his opposers and associations with 80 million of his agents on Twitter.
Trump tells him to get into the gate of those called "false news" in television and journals, which he's saying a warrant of unexpected people.
But the president even has often rated under the massians, and now it means Trumps as a misunderstanding.
The GPS system may be unsafe
Many work to develop other location technology than the GPS system.
The medical doctor says that the reasons are to be known to be concerned about the safety of the GPS system in the United States.
The old Loran system has been renewed.
The GPS technology will help us every football.
We use it when we flee, switch, and run, to landscape, and to travel.
The latest leads to thinking that she is a military instrument in the United States, which opened her first for the general use of the nineteenth century.
GPS technology uses a rubber of 200,000 miles height over the earth, thus have a small effect on it in nature.
“ But it is very easily to suffer her.
And wrong-doing people can easily disturb this mark," says Sãomund E. Thorsteins' son, player of the University of the University of Iceland and experts on the risk management and the security of the aircraft.
He also says easily to send errors with a straight place, for example in war.
“The GPS system is in the United States Protection Assembly.
They have assured the general that the system is in all times.
But they will certainly be able to shut it into the head of a very special president to let it do so, then he expected to do it," says the Samantha.
Therefore, many have been able to think that systems and local technology are able.
The Russian and China’s businesses are their own architectural systems, and the European Union is to destroy the Galileo position system from the stakes.
“The Galileo system is first built for citizen use.
Perhaps it has been more close to justice and is naturally under the Government of the European Union.
Then there's not a government government that can do so, but many," says Sounds.
But many are also going to look back to the old laran-technology.
It is based on exhibitions and was used since 6 years and until GPS technology was over.
Loran-marks are sent to very long boxes from downstairs on earth.
“This is the new version of the eLoran eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, who are seriously looking at it in many countries to have a system of care, because it describes a few laws to suffer it, it is much more difficult than to distress the system of transactions, ” says Saturmond.
However, it is probably safe to have access to most local systems.
The officer of the Dunch Vern Buchanan was made by the choice of the coronary office
"Gary was an employee in the prison and the deep of the public servant," Buchanan said on Facebook.
“ He turned to life so many and was loved and died by those who knew him.
I will never forget how survived he was, the scarlet and the unique joy that he received from his destruction."
The bookan’s office showed a report in the tenth month ago, where Tibbetts had not been in any recent communication with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida ́ has reported about 414.511 cases from the beginning of the world’s age, which is more than 41.00 in New York, together with the riquest health groups.
The data of the health administration show that the instructions on the race have been followed by about 79% from the American National Date of 4 July.
The data show that at least 50 feeding parts in Florida have reached the endurance limits on Wednesday.
"We made aware of the effect of this," DeSantis said in June.
"In the same time, the police need and the legality of this had a positive effect."
Flight from Hornafide to Master City
Turkey, Russian, Rounds, Scrolls, Glythbruss, and Grythmus are among the birds that have fallen to land in some.
On the southern-East birds, the birds of the birds can be seen nearly every day, where they have seen and sometimes their generations.
They are many birds in Iceland.
For the purpose of this, the number of those who enjoy the Facebook page of the islandic birds can be called.
The members of the group are about 14.600.
There are shared pictures of birds, and it is clear that Iceland is rich of good photographs that have the patient materials needed to make birds.
It's one of them.
As he is called, the bird’s officer of the South East and the South East Natural Agency, and it is well coming with the bird’s lives in that area.
He speaks beautifully about this beast that makes rich life in Iceland and gives a significant role there, and then does not change whether the bird is a big and big bird or a small bird.
It was established in 2005 on Saturday of the Neighbourhood of the Kwiskers in the Ocean by the aim of airing and providing the significant natural studies that he had undertaken since 1940.
"The half day was thirty years old when he started to add information about birds," Brinbulf says in conversation with Kernan.
"We're on the bird's rock, we do not just the same thing as Halfdan did, but we're building up his data by counting and marking the birds."
Halfdan was commanded and a translator, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientists about plants, birds, and birds.
He was born on February 10, 2017, most likely nine years old.
The half - day and his sisters in Kwiskers were interested in many of them in the islandic nature.
In that group, Börn Gisli Arnarson, "the employee" of the Ucclean Employment.
Björn was grown up at Reyniv’s areas in the Southern Sweet, and he fled a rich natural duplicate in his neighbors, the half of the Kwiskers.
But what is it actually doing in the South East Place of Future?
On March 20, each year, the Ucclean Point set up a special bird-line in the United States, a treated dose within the Hornafide Hafen.
There are standard marks for the birds coming into the network.
The nets are taken down in approximately 10 May when the warp is laid down.
The nets are up all days, at least six hours tomorrow and on Wednesday.
And they need to visit at a hour.
The birds in them are marked, cut and then cast into the freedom.
In a hour of time, ask a journalist in a stranger.
“Yes, we changed this with us, Bøsi and I.
Since we are going to work for us now, this can be a numeric puzzle but somewhere we are going to do this," says Brynbulf.
The networks are then set back on 1 August to 10 November — all the days allowed.
In addition to the networks and at the time they are not up, the Brinbulfs and Björn are to mark crops, trumpets and different movies where they reach them.
Moreover, they take different specific tasks.
One of these works is developed in collaboration with the Iceland National Agency and is involved in collecting birds.
“The wheat is throwing on the birds on their winters, and then goes with them to our country.
Soon before they get away, they are not big when they come to Iceland.
So he goes out of the bird and trys to find someone else when he needs to keep it."
But too many miles.
A question of how the birds in the South - East country have this summary said that the brinbulf seems to be well walking — where she had an army over her.
"And the wall of the whistle here is at Hala in the South West, and there's all right.
But it's not going to find any bit to find any more at the Yekuls' age, where a few years ago it's been a big warp."
He says that a few years ago, there have been thousands of circles, but now it is possible to count them on the other hands.
“When we look at the birds and the birds, I feel that it has decreased what you find of them last year.
But, of course, it's always a change between years."
What can explain to the great changes of Brinjolf’s story probably refers to the presentation.
"This is what you're going to do about food."
Then humans could have the work of saying about the descendants of birds and other animals.
However, some birds seem to have made this summary well in South East.
“Every of the things I feel like it is to cooking is to go back after a great degree, ” says Brynwulf, “but while the trumpets have gone abroad the last year and the year ago. ”
Of the birds, it seems to be like the marine is going to walk well in his cup in some ways as before.
Shooters and adolescents had increased something, but the Brinbulf says that it would not come into light before the way some of them have experienced.
But let's turn to the flights.
They often wake great attention, especially if they are very delicate and even colorful.
These two attitudes may have about one of the most friendly parts of the sum: the Russian Sermon.
"On the other way, it has been quiet in some of the camps," says Brynbulf, but it says that in the south there is now to find the grass tree, and then the rings have been seen and are going to work here.
When Brinbulf and Börn come into the treasure of cattle, they also mark it, just as other birds.
Tags are international, and they are in time out of the world.
Some of the marks, such as the animals of the birds, where they work and where they are.
“ It is even possible to see what they are long on the air, ” says Brinbulf.
These information are beneficial in many ways, to imagine when it comes to the board of birds.
"It has always increased knowledge."
If someone outside the world finds a bird that has been signed by the Birds of South East, the information will be sent to the Iceland National Agency.
"We have received a recycling from the capital city in South Africa.
There's been a whistle we've marked.
One of us was found later in the United States."
One bird is the special idea of Brinbulf, and that's the shadow.
"The Summ is our bird," he states, "and points out that the UV and the Natural Agency of South Eastern Society are the task to deal with his descendants, which has become too lost and now he has come to the village.
It is difficult to examine what has been done in the body, but one teaching is that the square has made a seaport that was previously taken from fishing baths and out of the sea to good than that it is now going to use it much better and that it has been influenced on the square.
Are you in the best place in the country to go with birds?
“ You will not naturally bring me to say no, ” says Brinbulf, “and we are also following the fucking birds, we are probably going away. ”
However, the South East country is certainly especially when a bird comes to life.
“ This area is just as it came to the European country, and the birds are so devastated.
To be here to look at birds and birds, it is very interesting, but here is less to find birds than the other place in the country.
It isn't far from flight and to jackle, so that the area that makes it good to consider the birds."
But on the Bryllin's appeal?
He thinks about a short time before he answers.
The question is hard.
"Because my bird is the end, I have found nine of the ten who have seen in the land," he answers.
“Now I just feel pleasant to take pictures of crossings.
So it is always pleasant to find birds that haven't been seen here in the country or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new design for Europe."
But they both have done that.
If you want to work better with the work of Binna and Bøssa at the South Eastern U.S.A., you can work with their work on Facebook and on the Web of Fuglar.
Sadi-Arabia – Solar stream of the future? No alcohol or bikini
The traveling facility has grown greatly increasingly in the world in the past years, and now the government in Saudi-Arabian will have its cooked ships.
The government is aware of the destruction that corresponds to approximately 60,000 billion island crowns to the land’s road Paradise.
The Guardian explains this.
However, this roaming Paradise will not be in the style of the Islands to be used in the Southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be offered and women will not be allowed to solve in bikinies.
How, though, should travelers end this island’s land?
For example, it must be done by building a new city where white streets, moon (other than humans), dronail cars, and machines that serve people.
The Guardian says that it's Mohammed bin Salman, the Cron Prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to read in this festival.
Of course, money must be covered in the oil country.
The Crown Prince says that there is no reason that women can leave to hide axles and cow in public positions, but recognize that there is not a simple issue of creating a roaman paradise in the country because it is too designed there when the sun is highly on the air and is not able to trust in the wind calamity.
However, you can wonder if it does not take e.g. the interesting of the people who are insufficient if they cannot buy alcohol.

There is no evidence of how the handler or other refsic actions have effect on his offer.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to deal with the deficiency in 2014, because of a significant support for the armed Christian groups of Anti-Balaka.

Thomsen wants to go from KR - Accounts by reduced payments
Tobias Thomsen will try to come home to Denmark, from the Icelandic Master KR, in the next month, and tells us to find interest in fellow believers in Denmark section 1.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has become the Icelandic Master both with Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old researcher said that he was going to miss Danish and wanted to move there with his loving - kindness, Stefania, Jacob’s daughter.
The Danish agreement with KR was valuable to end this game, so it is clear that the Danish company needed to feed with the KR on the purchase to get it in August before a new game is in Denmark.
Moreover, Thomsen would wait there until wearing to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish parts start again at the end of August.
It means, of course, that I had to comply with my agreements with KR-ing, but I told them I miss Danmark, and they have a full understanding of it," Thomsen said at bold.dk.
He added that he should have a very good relationship with Roman Christ’s son of servants who had shown the fully understanding situation, and Thomsen did not say that the purchase would be a great problem.
“ I have also had a share of two partners after that share was completed and the people knew where they would end.
It has been a bit of interest now in the future time so that it may be good that I go to Denmark before the Iceland Division," said Thomsen, but added that there were no many partners in Denmark who purchased his agreement with KR.
“ This is not clear now, but it has been interested in.
I also need to find the best opportunity for me and my love that is from Iceland and comes with me.
"People on some things," said Thomsen, and looked first to the purchases.
Thomsen said that KR-inge wouldn't be concerned because he didn't care for all of them in practices and games, although he missed Denmark.
"KR knows what it gets from me, and it's that I do the 100 percent.
I can really see because I miss Danmark when I'm in age or in games," Thomsen, who clearly says that he's going to reduce the wages to go from the Iceland Masters in the next part of Denmark.
“I am probably going to decrease only in the payment, out of the coronary crisis that seems to have crushed the Danish partners only more than those of Iceland.
But I am also studying, and one solution was that a company developed my job.
The majority of the partners in section 1 are, yes, associated with strengtheners.
I'm learning the development management in the playing conferences, and I'm finishing the bachelor-grade," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been at the beginning of the KR in two games in Pepsi Max parts at this game, but has come to the history in five games and has determined one point.
He started 21 games in the past and switched the sea.
KR is the same option to go to the top of the Pepsi Max partition and to play a good game, but the KA will be met today on Akureyri.

Income was hungry to press Yoho after events in the house
WASHINGTON (AP) – Without the Christian conferences that would end hungry, on Wednesday, they said that they would have invited the tenant Ted Yoho to speak from the government of the convictions, and that he would have come to it, after what they called "appeal" to the tenant Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, a Democracy prisoner in New York, said to Yoho, the prisoner of the Republic of Florida, to use a low and female speech when he foretold it when they met at the groups of the house in the last month.
Yoho, therefore, concluded that he had not used the words that were witnessed until the reporter confirmed that the event would have been as she described.
Bread for the World said in a statement that the Government of the towns had met Yoho on Friday and agreed after he said of himself to “righte our commitment to stand with women and inheritance people, inland and worldwide, which leads us to the world with the involvement of all sex and justice."
On the Bread for the World page, “the same Christian voice” presses them on the tent and government to end hungry in the country and worldwide.
“ Since Bread for the World is unexpected to Christian conferences that have the goal to reduce hunger and poverty with confidential public initiatives to keep the communities on their respect, relief and concern that Jesus asks us to show when we have associations with people in governments, where it is in the political literature, ” says the report.
"With our death reflects the new attitudes and words of the teacher Ted Yoho, which was recorded in the family, not the moral needs made for our control."
When the report was acquired, the speaker Yoho had not answered a computer mail with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible talk in the last fifteenth day, Ocasio-Cortez said dramaticly from the event and endorsed her words that she called a man's rape as “conscious of violence and violent speech to women”.
More than two of her partners understood her words of being an example of a very common behavior of men.
Yoho described the event that we had shortly discussed the scenario and that “no one would have been anxious, laid into a single or attacked. ”
He said that he had shown “good advice. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is at its first time as a pregnancy and has received both air and load for its cleaning.
The 65 - year - old Yoho is one of the maintenance forces of the Servant, and he will be set in the holy stone at the end of his fourth cycle.
Wait for 98 minutes in local icons by scoring the first time limit
Jesse Lingard had not scattered or placed in the English department at this game, until he hit the Leicester walk today in 98 minutes in the end of the division.
Lingard had not been broken in the English division since he doubled Cardiff in December 2018.
He entered as a warman today for Manchester United when Leicester was able to meet the Maastricht Seat.
When our rooms are seen, the normal playtime of the Lingard bottle of Casper Schmeichel, Leicester, is being able to go to the right place.
A long place at Jesse Lingard.
Real Madrid players dismiss the rules on the whistle
Zinedine Zidane and his students in Real Madrid will be able to meet England in their later game with Manchester City, in the Maastricht European, without going for two weeks.
The British Government has determined that travelers from Spain go for two weeks of trip to expand the coronarship.
However, there are exceptions, such as in the case of the highest growth.
Confirm the consultation of the development with Sky Sports.
The advice says that individuals who are determined by the rules will only be in limited areas, for close doors.
Do not refer to inflammation, judges, duties, pharmacists and pharmacists.
The Madridians can therefore meet Manchester City on 7 August without dealing with a long time in England, but they are 2 to 1 once after the loss of Santiago Bernabee on February 26.
The cigarette is a result of the 8th department that comes to Portuguese.
Inflammation and supervision of the country on human health
From the news of overflow hotels and tents to judge, at least sunnantal, Icelands have been able to move this summary.
If those who have placed the country under the foot have even been adequately welcomed with weather and meteorological DV in one case that the number has just been purified in the case of a prominent, at least to the least.
However, now it is sent to the worldwide holiday that has come to the most of the year’s traveling holiday.
However, it is not surprised how it will be this year, compared to other weeks, that events that in the usual year have done a lot of people not to be held.
For example, it is enough to be called a national festival.
The fear will, of course, play a big role, but now it appears to lighting throughout the country, but especially southern and southwest.
The Watchtower prophesyed the outcome from fifteenth night and at least on Wednesday evening.
The examples are that long-term events are not holy truth here in the North Atlantic Sea and are of course able to make changes.
In his prophecy, the Watchtower of One Sweenbørns’ son, says on his weather, that a lady is waiting for the Holy Man’s Holyness.
He says: Electricity in the halls with apparent colds that are too close to the surface, leads to that when the south - west air tries to be closed only with wind and destruction.
It is also wise to clear the air that is "fighting" over the north.
One prophecy shows its prophecy to support and says: “The small pictures from America fight to the east and with it a lot of air.
When she comes near, she approaches the "blower" in the form of reduction of air pressure and adequate combination.
The Great Prophecy, the European station of design at the left of the card and the American GFS prophecies on the right are sometimes compatible with this development.
The divorce of the ship is going to pass the prophecy lately on the fifteenth day and fast on the Friday, with the west of A-A and the kingdom of the most low country.
The medical medium of about 985 hPa is later in the coal.
Since this time, the North and Eastern air is a lot of aircraft on Wednesday and even Sunday.
Yet, it was the result of the consequences.

When Birna Hrønn Börns daughter, owner of the Pink Iceland Travel Agency, looked like many Icelandians at the Law and Order Law and Command: Special Victims Unit from age, she coaled for the primary women of Marisk Hargitay.
Birna says the story of her findings and her player in the streets of Love Stories in Ras 1.
When Birna was a young man, at the age of many who started developing an excited love with herself, she did not experience it as her older ones because she was attempted to call her own teachings.
She feared to have interested in kids’ sounds and youths in the films, but it did not.
“I was throwing out of the popbs and picking pictures on the wall of backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just I realized that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes, when people come out of the ship, it will go into the woods of the woods.
“ We have destroyed the years of the young ones to admonish these young ones, these shoes and such things.
I think it was one of the things that brought me to her," Birna said about the game woman.
“And it was something with her.
She felt a good player, beautiful and humble, and I was just shot in her look."
It came to the game when she was supported in New York a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Erling Ottar Thorddsen, was to make a film in the city, and received Birna and their friends, Gunnar Holy Godjon, to help them.
“ We were working in 30 people in the town and being a good time with unrelevant people.
It's naturally intimate spirit air when a man destroys such a long time a day together so that it was spoken about everything and not nothing."
Once a day, Birna is a great marina.
One woman in the town says that her friend is familiar with her wife because he was in the board of the participants.
Birna could not stop meditating on that determination and ask her new friend regularly how her friend looks like to work with her wife and whether Birna could meet her.
"He tells me to stop this, she doesn't know if she can make it happen," says Birna.
Finally, when we take the film, the boy and Birna are finally trying to make sure that the woman is trying to come to the meeting.
"He was supposed to get some of herself and said she'd just get this."
A few days later, Birna sends a message to the woman and asks if something is happening.
The woman doesn't answer, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she wake up with a long message.
“ I'm looking at the phone, and I'm angry.
The golden sanctuary wake up at the east, and I say, "I must go into the trumpet, and I will make me good, and go down into the two."
The woman then wrote to Birna that her friends, players and Law and Orders were supported on a hotel at Times Square.
"I don't know when they start or when they are lost, but this is the name of the hotel, you walk well," says the message, and Birna dresses himself in a snare.
The bird comes and waits until a woman comes to her and asks if she can help.
"I say I'm looking for Jason, and I asked her to tell him that Birna from Iceland was coming."
When the friend finally comes, he looks forward to Birna and asks how in the injuries she has reached the end of the end, it would have been a rare security.
Birna explains that she has just taken the advice and asks to meet Mariška.
“Yes, I don’t know.
Sit here," says the friend and Birna are silent.
On the other hand, it’s a part of the parts and they're starting to go together.
"I say to him, "I am a pleasant, but you?" Birna said.
"I played this like this was the most normal thing in the world."
The time's coming, and Birna's waiting.
The players are regularly present when the wheel is taken, they get a talk, and Birna looks around and looks for Marica, which is not visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he is sorry.
Birna asks him to come in the hands of a lack of worker, but he does not want her to go soon.
A wonderful friend agrees with it and closes to another employer.
"He comes with another friend and says, "He is a woman from Iceland who will finally meet Mariski."
So he's going.
Finally, after two times, a new friend runs to Birna.
“He says, "Fly.
There are unusual circumstances today, there are journalists with her, so she will not stop.
She's going the best way to car with them, so you've got to take the mind and go down and find her wheel.
It's white, and it's marked.
Come on."
"So I'm looking at the right and losing my face" Birna's square and going down with the medicine on Times Square.
There she finds about 40 wheels, some characteristics, and some don't.
However, Mariski’s wheel doesn’t find it, and then it’s expected to put her back.
“ I found that the book is over me because I was ready to delete half day in this, but I thought so well, I tried.
It was funny."
Hope up again, Birna, in view of the hotel where she looks around the window, looks at it with the end of the end of the fact that Birna did not have its planning.
The birds are able to reach the race, and it begins to ridicule.
“ I go under the clouds to explain to my Kingdom.
So I look at the right and lose my face."
None other than Mariska Hargitay stood there in the buxing box that she dressed in the parts and Birna knew well — but Birna was able to be able to be moved by the medication.
“ I look at the body and the hands and think now you must move.
Now you have to go to her."
It makes it, and it makes it up to cut it into the eye of the game.
“ She looks at me, and I can say nothing.
But I'm just healthy, and I'll say, "Birna's up.
“ I say I am from Iceland, and I am very proud.
She says, "It's great to meet you."
The conversation has not reached much more because the Marisku car is set and it is blown on it.
Marisk turns back to Birna and says: “I must go, but it was very happy to meet you. ”
The birds of the idolatry, the car's running away, and they're broken together.
“ I called the driving in Erling and Gunna and they thought that it hadn’t been done.
But I was crying about a snare and joy.
I'm saying, yeah, I met her. You have to meet me now.
So we're throwing into sodium water and tequila," Birna says.
She does not see anything, though she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ This is the same time in life, offering such a time and energy to allow such things to happen.
But I'll always be honest to this woman."

Court tries to determine that children will be removed from the maintenance of influency
In his exposure on the morning, the judge Dolly Gee was unworthy of a expectable time limit by saying that the influence and toilet in the United States would not have been allowed to lose children if it could not be done with any of the three ways described in its previous order.
However, Gee emphasised it in his order that the influence and toilet options remained to be left to leave the children without any need.
The three causes of Gee are to allow families who are attaining influencing and tolerant solutions, to put children in the hands of a responsible person or to solve families to receive a general court.
Shalyn Fluharty, representative of the Proyecto Dilley Agency, who provides the family in the field of legal service, condemned the decision and told her to put it in the hands of the interactional and tolerant authorities to decide whether the child should have children.
"I think that children have been arrested untimely and they are not going out except the interaction and the toilet of the family accepts it, or the family agrees to leave them in the middle," said Fluharty.
Family members are held at three places in Berks in Pennsylvania, South-Texas (Dilley) and Karnes in Texas.
Children in these situations are at the age of 1 to 17 years associated with legal laws and professionals.
In June, Gie, watched by the Flores Convention on the Education of Children, said that, in June, “the rules on the use of grain and societies were not or bad” would be urgent to move children from these works.
969 persons maintained in the administration and administration of the body have been identified with the coronation and are in single or monitored from and from 23 July, in combination with influenza and duplication.
Of them are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in the maintenance for family.
More than 3700 cases have been confirmed in preservation
Consider the setting of the controller’s self - control
The president does not say unusually that animals have been involved in their feedingstuffs on the right job of people.
The observations of the Sedlabank manager to ensure self-sufficiency of the Governing Body, possibly with laws, shall be adopted to consider.
After Icelandair had discussed the Airlines Society of Iceland and told all the airports that the Government of the VRs had been aware of that the Governors of the Lifeyrissian business managed by the Lifeyrissian authorities or that they had been able to participate in the livelihood in an interesting part of Icelandair.
Ragnar Thor Inífsson, President of the VR, said that the governments would be replaced if they were not able to accept the recommendations.
Ragnar Thor took his statement for three days later and the same government of the UK.
Aceass Jonsson, a seat manager, said in news on Friday ROUV to ensure self - controllers needed in the agreed sea and may have legal changes.
Catherine Jacob’s daughter of Presidency says importantly that the rulers of life are self - controllers, but now thinks that it is already safe by laws.
"Now the Sedlabank manager, which is, of course, walks with the feedback facility that has to do this, says that it's going to look at the special rules in the circles of this autonomy, we'll, of course, consider it if something is needed to go over there," she says.
Katrin says that the laws of living acids should have a moral role in their feedingstuffs.
It is likely that it is aware of the social and moral matters they want to focus on in their feedingstuffs.
“I didn’t think of an unusual similarity that animals put themselves into the feedingstuffs on the right job of people.
But I think normally that such decisions are taken in the basic practice, but not in the case of individual feedback conditions," says Katrin.
“Incomplete travellers with Olfus abroad”, states the President of the Governing Board of the Civil
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the Governing Body of the City, says a cycle that is made by the Olfus abroad at Selfossi daily incomplete.
He hopes that the invitation for new bruises over Olfusa will go into the west.
Now when the islanders are running around their country, and a big movement in the country is being created every day a roadway to the Olfus Arbusto when the employees are on the road of Selfoss or in the road of the campaigns.
Long lines are drawn to the bridges and can take the patientness of the areas to wait.
"Yeah, it's totally unsatisfactory, this is one trip here and not only on Fridays because this is just the word in active days too.
There are long prayers, sometimes in Greece for those who want to come here in the east of the country, and those who are coming into the west, so that it gives the way that we are trying to get a new brush and not later,” says Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the Government of Arborg.
Healty says that the campaign in Arrburg has recently met with the leader of the Watchtower and the Watchtower, and the finding has been very well.
"If sometimes a man has been shown that it was to work in these matters, I think I can say it now because it's really to work in this, and we have to see that a new brue will be invited to go out."
But is there any advice to the inhabitants who are in prayer to the Olives of Olives all the days of the summer?
"Yeah, it is possible to go the trip and in the woods of the Eyarbake, but it is quick for those who are going east to the camp, it is not possible to tell them to go to the Lyngdals, but those who are going in the camps should use the Mosfels Chamber, Tandal and Lyngdals."
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the Governing Body of the City, who says the cycle of the Olfus arbustic of Selfos inconsistently.
Large prayers are made every day with Olfus abuses and adults are often waiting for the computer time to overcome the bridges.
Then the only counsel is to draw the spirit deeply and think about something quite clearly.
Forward visiting the coals in the north of Brisbane
The citizen government said that, in the area, it would be a significant degree between the Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Promotional operators have distorted the absence of civil governments to the judicial and environmental rules with the arguments that the building is in accordance with the Law on Civil Population since 2014, would meet the organizational and social needs which have not been satisfied to this and could “sustain without unexpected effects”.
A great opposite is about these prejudices in the neighborhood.
Thus, although the order is completely in accordance with the organization, it may be possible to change it if it does not meet the needs, rather than refusing it.
Similarly, there are many steps, including service, childhood, and 39 homes.
Official transmissions were more than 120 at the meetings, and most of them were counted on the opportunity where it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
Brisbane, a town manager of the memory, said that the city needed to buy the country to protect the coalabir.
"[The Governor] Adrian Schmund has to stop swallowing the sea tax officers in the fight against the court-making and buying this country to protect the nature and animals of Brisbane," said citizen Cassidy.
"These are the most important visits of the Coalabs in the Mountain to Mangroves area, and there are the numbers of coalbs."
In the weekend, Schrank said that the citizen government wanted to be watched by the coalbs in the area.
"We found a notice to get to the area," Schmund said.
"We understand that this will now go into the court system, and obviously we hope that it will lead to a good and safe outcome that will be to keep the visit."
Schlank said that the carding of the Coal Aviationers would be a common responsibility for citizens and administrators, but that the Governing Body was responsible for the neighborhoods of the Coal Arabs who are locally responsible for the visit of the Coal Aviation.
Sunset: The next step is to work something
Ole Gunnar Solscher, minister Man Utd, had hoped that the nation had secured the third seat in the English divorce today.
This will therefore play at the next time in Europe’s Maastricht.
The United holding or safety of Leicester was currently thrown and was 2-0 Red diamonds.
“A great consequence of the players to get the third seat, as well as how the place has been at the time.
I think we might have come over a spiritual brain by working such a big game, where we have lost two times in the outermost lines at this time.
We knew we needed a decline today, now we can have the next chapter that is in these boys to work titles," said the Solscher's guard.
Manchester United has still the opportunity to work a title at this time, but it's playing in the European Department in August and it's as good as it came in the 8th department.
Weapons are in the midnight of the Eastern Ukraine warfare
Kiev, Ukraine – the Ukrainian Army and the East-Ukrainian respiratory campaign are now preparing "all-hart" weapons in the middle of the middle-night, which hopes that the first step is to be made in order to be paid after an approximately 6 years.
Religious responsibilities reported on Sunday that they had ordered their soldiers for weapons and ordered the prohibition of the use of weapons.
Ukrainian said that his armies have “prepared sea” for the weapons.
If it was in the past, it would "determine the way for the future of other people" of the Minsk-Peace Society would agree with the reporting of the President of Ukraine before the week where the weaponswater was called a timetable.
The aim of the Minsk-Peace Assembly, which was made in 2015 for the purpose of France and Germany, was to solve the decisions between Ukraine and the divorce that enjoy the Russian Employment, but the decisions were made in 2014 after the introduction of Russia in the Chrymskagan and the support of the country with the distinctions.
More than 14,000 people have been in the attacks.
Russian and Ukraine presidents enjoyed the weapons vehicle on Sunday and focused on the importance of attending the meeting in Paris in December.
Vladimir Putin, Russian President, was concerned about Kiev's call that the Minks Assembly would be revised and said that Volodimir Selenski, Ukrainian President, “the change of the Minsk Assembly, which he still made in this call, should be reflected in real actions”.
Selenski, however, focused on the need for “more action” to save Ukrainians who are captives of the rebellion in Eastern Ukraine, the integrated Croatian and Russian Republic, a common report from the President's office.
In accordance with the co-operation since 2015, Ukraine can only receive a rule over territories in Russia in the areas in which the divorce has been undertaken when they have received a major self-administration right and when elections have been held in the areas.
The assembly was deceived, but Ukraine and rebellious people have changed in shoes.
When the leader of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to have other discussions, the support of the Minsk community was made and agreed to retain peace.
Selenski, who won the election in 2019 with promises to end the attack, wanted Ukraine to take over the borders for the first environmental elections, but the Government in Kreml requires that the agreement be taken to make progress without change.
The new weaponscommunication reached the middle-day for the three-party cooperation group established by the European Security and Society Agency of Russia and Ukraine, which was thus approved by the EU Employers.
In the normal Sunday breakfast at Peterstorm, Franz Paf e.g. was reminded of the weapons road and said that it had to “rebuild confidence and put the foundation for the very necessary and long-term seat with the people. ”
Police: Man shot in Texas' protests

The protests were stretched on Facebook, and there they could hear in the floor of the car and some shots that were lost.
Marksupe in the first victory of Blika in July
Breeding moments of 29 June, the IA was able to be able, 5-3, in Pepsi Max shared guys at Copavow wild tonight.
Skammers return to their opposite the third game in the division.
After the first three of their games in the division, the five-year-old games had been played and had been lost three in the morning for the IA game tonight.
It was, therefore, to be thrown or killed for Blick, which could have been able to enter into the game with great power.
Alexander Helgi Sigurders Son came to the leader with a legal description on 11 minutes after Christ Steindors’ son sent him into the chairman of the IA.
Six minutes later, the Christ doubled the way after the special legal preparation of the Eyel Son of Galilee from the left.
Skammers did not come to land or land in the first half of the past, where high - pressed homes made them greater need to join missions.
We had the power of the wall and the third market in 36 minutes when Danit Thomas Mikkelsen entered the horn of the Hoscult Gunlaugs Son.
Then Christ Steindors, the Son of Steinhors, made a second and fourth place of Blick only three minutes later.
The story of the first half, however, did not end there.
Skammers had hoped for the last time, when Safevi Hrafn Haraldsson was cut off the white-shirt rock for games, but Kwame Quee had struck Viktor Jons’s son in front of Blika.
Therefore, 4-1 was placed for the width moment when the half-flade was able.
Only three minutes later, when the Skagamans returned.
In the past, Safar Johnson was alone and uncontrolled on a significant Blick, and he easily moved the bottles into the network after the hornless Security of Harald’s Son.
However, it was a way of crime inside the IA team only three minutes after he passed to Alexander Helga.
The witches were judged, and Thomas Mikkelsen was safe to get over 5 to 2 when only seven minutes were lost of the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's purpose, the Skagamans returned.
Anton Ari Einarsson, director Blika, put them under pressure from Viktor Jons’ son, gave Viktor’s foot on where the bottle was rejected.
Incredible 5 to 3 places have been identified as less than ten minutes from the last half of us, but it has reached the market currency.
Despite wine, it would be possible to add to limits, including two dead Kwame Quee from the width moment, they were not more than 5-3 width moments of the game.
The first time of the month, since 29 June, was born with the first time of its death, followed by 14 degrees in the third seat, two steps from the Val seat, and three from the top of the KR.
However, KR and Valer are both playing in Blika.
IA must be consented to the third paint in the division, but the population has ten degrees in the eighth seat, five steps from the floor.
The white House's white rate is not in danger.
The promotors of the Wolfsweet have not been able to stop showing the child’s product in the near future.
The report comes to Kayleigh McEnany, the white House's Family Ministry, in the case of the police officer, that the ships, including the police officers, would be the victim lamp of the "outils" (e. cancel culture).
Canadian producers of the parts were quickly responding to McEnany’s words and expressed that their members had no concern for the future of the WHO.
Some numbers of television series that run about the police have been taken from the American vision to the consequences of anti-political violence in the United States.
However, the population is not there, despite the use of this material in the community.
At the White House's Office on Friday McEnany said that the Trump American president would be the opposite of the "outilock" and especially when the police arrived.
In this regard, it is concerned when a person or a company or an employee has a severe response to community media, and it is recognized that the party is in the counterparty.
“ We saw it a few weeks ago that the views on the Hvolpas Veet, the police childhood, were stopped.
Like Cops and Live PD," McEnany said on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish player Lego has taken a police office from the sale, but no foot is confirmed by the Defensors of Lego.
However, reality levels of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken from the view of the west.
Both participants are involved in showing real policies without receiving permission in persons shown there.
At the same time, in 29 years of age, disappointment and torture comes
Christian Tomas daughter, a family student, answers questions to readers about the matters of family, children, and love in the Family Century DV.
By this time, she answers to readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, we have been together for 29 years, and we have two children.
We know nothing but being together, and we feel well, but we both have been ashamed of something.
We have never been with human beings, and we do not have any comparison with how this was to be unfair.
Sometimes, disappointment and uncertainty have been caused in relations with whether the party is looking around, thinking about preservation or even discernment and adjustment.
When we talk about this, we are agreed to draw up our relationship, but this is so great that always depends on us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a wonderful question, and I am very sure that you have a so open communication that you can discuss your lines in connection with your relationship.
What would fear me would be if you were thinking about this in the corner, you couldn't talk about this and even take some step you've seen so later.
Everything up on tables, isn't it always best?
Heavy self - control has the most valuable value of happiness in the future and the stronger self - imagination you have over, as it is probably that you are owned with strong self - imagination.
The reason that the association that begins in the early years of youth is not only forever, is often that people develop their own ways, but in cases of social impact, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your connection begins to imagine your most anticipational events, you may conclude that you have grown together and have a positive effect on the image of the other.
We meet the meetings we are at the same time.
That's how I'm talking, contrary to how you listen.
That's how I'm showing me the way you see me.
Combined with who we are.
You could turn the example and think: What do we have with others who do not have?
What gives us in particular these years?
I let me confirm that the costs can be too much more than the gates.
You have occurred in a year or a year old, and you may say that you are the one in the middle or in the middle.
It's more than many can say.
This worth?
You are saying that you are surprising that you have lost something, but it is important to remember that big changes such as divorce and new relationships are also a physician that you are not finally anxious.
You have been able to lose the start of again, learn to be alone again, to know a new person and to gather family members.
These are new challenges, anxiety, and may be something new and emotional.
But this is not just a dark cloud and happiness, unfortunately, at your age, this can be a broken job, which may never be able to do so well as you have already done or not.
Is that worth it?
Does it not be advised to focus on what you can do in order to increase your emotionalness, invisibleness, and new relationships?
You're not ready to put the shoes on the wheel.
It's so much you can do to make this long relationship still deep.
What trials can you do in connection with this?
What do you need from your meat that you don't get?
What can you give to your desires that you have never done before?
Perhaps you can get down and repeat your relationship.
Do you want to remove more time or time together?
Do you want to try something new?
Today, a number of more environmental suffering is related to various forms of connection and couples are going to determine their associations in different ways, such as open connections, numbers, or decisions to stop timely.
I don't tell you what you're doing, but no expert in your solution, but maybe it'll let this weak weakness over you, if you look at this and the thought of the solution.
What do you think of the unbelieving one and the fear will be disappointed?
You have been together for 29 years, it must mean that you are able to be different together.
Use it as strength, and keep your hands in mind for your solution.
We urge the reader to send their questions and privileges to Christian in a computer mail at: wedding salela@gmail.com.
The questions will be answered here in the family corner, of course without name and in full faith.

Coleen Rooney, lawyer Johnny Depp in the "Wagatha Christie" statement with Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has requested David Sherborne to defend the demands of meditation of Rebekah Vardy
After the relationship between the footballmen, their knowledge of the dramatic instructions
Coleen Rooney has advised the star officer in the translated Johnny Depp to defend himself in his so-called "Wagatha Christie" layout with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday Army believes that Rooney has caused David Sherborne to defend the requests that she had been subject to the terms of Wardy, with the view that personal information has been played to a family of its closed Instagram access.
The reports are reported a few days after our data has been reported to the High Justices, where Rebekah Vardy, who is married to Jamie Vardy, in the Leicester City football, has been physically and spiritually subjected to Coleen Rooney's positions.
The magazine reports that the five children, 38 years old, have “treated seriously injury and whispered so she was afraid to go out of the house” and that Vardy, who then came to six months, had“ three times been introduced into the scepter... because of the most deceased that can lead to the introduction and effects of her. ”
In addition to being Leader Depp in his meditation, the Sun went, because the player confirmed that she had fighted her wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, with the case of herogan and herogy of Sussex in their special case, published by The Mail on Sunday.
After interviews between the two football figures, those who are able to recognize the dramatic instructions in the courts have failed.
"If you found the Depp Rights Game, don't deal with the expected war of the football figures," said the householder.
"Now this is a real war. Coleen doesn't give anything, not Becky but. It'll be a feeling."
Coleen Rooney concluded that someone who used Instagram access to Rebekah Vardy had played his stories about her to the journal.
She was named "Wagatha Christie" after she had explained how she had been in five months in limiting a few friends together that could see updates in Instagram stories with her, so that only Wardy's account was left.
Coleen said that he had set a recorded story on Instagram, which later had been shown in a closure sheet.
In Wardy’s case, who does not share the matter, she has shown that she has been made a blue record after Rooney has shown the accusations “to overcome the advice, in order to control great damage and greater suffering. ”
The laws of Coleen have taken these words into account and said that the views of her pregnancy are only placed in front of the family and draws attention to the issue’s determinations.
"The Becky's halls are a disaster, that's all the exposure."
It's the lawyer Paul Lunt of the Brabner's police office in Liverpool, who is in the case of Coleen Rooney, who's four sons with the former British Master Wayne Rooney.
Wardy is at the Kingsley Napley police office in London, which is uncertain that she has still advised a lawyer.
Talkman Coleen Rooney refused to talk.
Bidens' Cosning Teams calls "Fox News Sunday" for a week after Chris Wallace with Trump
In the Conversation with Chris Wallace last week, the president of the United States of Trump was concerned that the expectable presidential Democratic Democracy, Joe Biden, would consult the question camp that Wallace fell on Trump.
If we will never answer that question — at least not in question.
On Sunday Wallace reported that Bidens's election team had told Fox News that he would be "no solution" in conversation.
"In our conversation with the President Trump last week, he was concerned that his opposite in Democracy, Joe Biden, would blow up in other circumstances," Wallace said.
"In the week we begged Biden's election teams to talk and they said that the former president would not be solved."
“ We're going to ask each week, ” he added.
Trumps' Cosning Athethematics have along months stressed Biden to avoid election meetings and newspapers while meetings during the coronary disorders.
Though Biden recently has renewed its choice motion, Trump and his companions have seen that the President's former "found" in Delaware's home.
However, the need for Biden to meet public events has not been pleasing for his offer, where new evidence shows that Biden has a good preview of Trump both in the country and in the major warrior.
The average Real Clear Politics reports that the president had 7 percent under Florida, 6.7 per cent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump won in all the kingdoms four in 2016, when he moved them to the Republic of the Republic when he won the War on the White House.
In the newly recognition of the Fox News Poll, Biden is a pre-score in Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, without a shocking limit in all cases.
The Canadians indicate that Biden had a little preliminary in Ohio, North Carolina and Arivona, three important warriors in this choice.
And the potential indicates that the previous trust of the Republic, such as Texas and Georgia, has now been changed between Trumps and the former president of the Republic.
The president's proposals where the president's sitting is offered in a second quarter-term in the White House are often to discuss the president – and it seems to be the case now in 2020 in the fight between Trumps and Bidens.
Previous the most dangerous issues have been the coronation and the economy that are in the case of the age, and the representative and the story of the President in both cases.
Kanye West and his glyma on the board
The tongueman Kanye West today asked his wife, Kim Kardashian, for excuses for the orders he had made too much.
The Medical Assistance Former believes that he has the power of his creation, but the physicians are important to take humans to maintain the injuries in the ships.
The Kanye West is not only one of the first and most effective musicians of the same time, but he is not later a man of the real reality of Kim Kardashian.
His unique life has greatly gone before open towels.
It was a great attention when he announced that this month before he was trying to offer himself to the president in the United States, and he kept emotional and irrelevant talks.
Later, some of his special tissues appeared on Twitter, where he concluded that his wife was trying to put him into the hospital.
Kim Kardashian later showed an explanation on Instagram, where she asked people to show her man and family understanding; he was with a mental disease, and it would be difficult for his friend to respond to him if he didn’t want to look for himself.
Then he asked her publicly for excuses.
This educational family is not the only thing to cope with this problem.
It is about one percent of people who have a illness.
Ferdinand Jonsson is over the architectures of the gender at the hospital in London, and he knows the judgment well.
“ THIS trial may lead to such an increasing immorality to individuals, especially their family and their loved ones.
Abuse or mania can destroy a conjunction and work and cause a great trial.
And so the gate, the weakness, is often great: for it is a high frequency of self-bearing in them.
That's a wonderful thing that she'd say this.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
The Son of Unnstein, president of the Watchtower, has seemed to be aware of the physician — and is assistant from Kanye West: “He seems to be with a very nice picture.
If we are more worthwhile than the earthly contrabasses, he is hundreds of strikes of the heavenly harp.
And he is so imperfectly created, imperfect powerful, and completely in his powerful uncleanness, because a man would have been with this deterioration that we have tried to go too much to know."
Kanye West doesn't want to take a physician, because he thinks they're going out of his creation version.
He's running over the cocktail, including on the Ye's floor.
It says that it is his choice to not take drugs.
"Many people feel that this creating element is involved in this undeserved kindness and the divine creation of the fire that he has, but so naturally, it is often great tribulations, and elderly and dim winds and darkness."
Ferdinand, however, says important that people with psychiatric disease are ill.
“If you have too much mania or mania, you don’t want to get to a great thing, you're only on the page.
And as when people go to serious weaknesses, people are very deceived of that condition," he says.
So you would recommend Kanye West to take drugs?
"Endly," says Ferdinand.
"And especially working with someone to find the right doses and this way that it may be equal between the most of the medicine and the destruction of those who remember him and his ability and his creation."

The Officers of the Officers of the Officers claim to wish public workers to be “eternal homes ” after the leaders opposed Boris Johnson that people returned to work
Our officers were talking about the desire of the workers to “forever in the house” after they met Boris Johnson's call for people to return to work.
The prisoners of the Ishald Group were angry when the public and general employee community told their companions to ask their feet when their leaders commanded them to return to their jobs.
Andrew Percy, former advocate, said that the needed public service, as the version of the route letters, would stop while the general workers were marketed, would have taken hard hands to maintain the community walking in the coronary age.
“ It is unusual that people refuse to turn back to their jobs while workers in households and workers throughout the country have worked to work in order to eat public workers during this time, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees are now going to work, but they cannot be able to return to their jobs, although it is safe.
Working officers can't maintain this approach to dwell forever – especially not now when we know that people can turn back to work."
After the last week of the president, Alex Chisholm, the newspaper of the public public service, announced that the advice would “afflict the workers of public service from their home and quickly return to their job until 1 August. ”
The public and general employee community assigned to their companions, estimating about 200,000 people, that they had not needed to meet this need, and that it was about politics.
A speaker of the public and general employees, the largest workshop of the public workers in the United Kingdom, said that the requirement of returning to the job would “not be made with health and security of our partners in the field, or to strengthen the economy.
A single warning is made because of political pressure from the forces of the Conservation Group that require public service is used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to the companions is clear: If you make your hands home, and someone in your share asks you to meet you again to the job, you shall not take what you're sure you're trying to do."
The departments may be increasingly unappreciated with latest versions of route letters because of workers at home, but about 400,000 people are now expected to deduct their visits.
The Internal Assembly has now stated that it will “search for flexibilities” from the United States for the next two weeks of motion, and from those who have requested a guideline for more than four weeks.
The public and general workers have recognized that some have been able to wait until 143 days after route letters, but that “small and often thirsty letters ” make 4000 persons of the road letter service difficult for a week to maintain a needed distance.
The President of the Governing Body, David Davis, urged the leader of workers to “comfort once ” and to seek a community with the government to return people to their jobs.
So he added that if he was in the government, he would ask the chief officers, "What is it that you want, that people may be at home in all things?"
However, by the largest British company, Johnson has commanded people to return to work.
A larger job study of about 400,000 employees showed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their jobs.
Review of the history can result in significant interactions
Now, understanding and understanding should be the goal.
The school system is part of learning about this knowledge and understanding card.
Too small is learned by the Australian story.
The reality is that, without a wide range of actions, the only teaching article is especially referring to our story — “Saga Australia ” for 12 bucks — will die within the next five years or even before.
In the last year, only 628 students in Victoria studied in Australia’s history of 49.324 who ended basic school, or only 1%.
In the last six years, this talk has almost reduced half, but nearly 100 less students are able to work each year.
The greatest reason for that so few students choose to learn about Australia’s history in the 12th century is that a few years ago have been done to wake their interests.
The story is not even a single study, but it falls under the greater “knowledge. ”
Therefore, students in the 7th and 8th were only one short unit on the "foreign building and east vessel on Torres Health and their education".
In the 9th and 10th year, the second unit of Australia is in the World Warfare.
Before many students in Victoria, this is all what is learned about Australia’s history in the basic school years.
On 9 and 10 years, another optional unit is 1750-1918.
Anciently, it is to strive to three actions to save the Australian story in Victoria's schools.
First, it is necessary that self - studies be like English, education and science.
Since the story is only teached as part of the thoughts, she gets a little space in the study.
She is usually teached by people who have general education in the minds but have not been educated in the history.
A pharmacological movement to the table for information is declined.
We need to advise several special physician teachers to make sure that such training is learned in a way available and exciting way.
Thirdly, Australia, from 1788 to 1914, will be obligation.
Students can mean what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s story at the 12th student, so they would have learned the material from the basis.
Knowledge of the one story and seem not to be married by a deaf man between sex.
But without her, as it is clearly found in Victoria's study, the task is unexpected.
Dr. Matthew Bach is a prisoner of freedom in Victoria's teeth and an ex-school of Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.

"Man are even to feed up now and value for 2021."
"I am a great National, loved preparation, and all around this, but sometimes something comes into the life that man doesn't govern, and then it's just that it's just that the story has done something to say that people ask whether the Eyamans can't leave the Nation 'once'."
◆ Lila says that they have not built a group for themselves or to encourage people to maintain their own National Festival, but to collect households on the World Holidays in Eyes this year.
“What did people do in these beautiful times?
I'm not going to use this in one or none, but then somebody comes to the articles that use such houses in something, but I was just getting to some area where people can enter what it is to do."
Then it is also necessary to load the burning of the Foscalet that is covered each year.
“ I think many are eager to get burning on Friday evening.
The only thing that, of course, makes a shock in the account is that the prophecy is nothing speech."
“It will be burned in this burning, but it will only be able to see how it will be, ” says Lilja.

Will the prince André be called in a new sex chamber?
The British Royal Family now serves for responding to the possibility of new information in courts about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A American judge has ordered a secret record of Epstein and Maxwell to be published
Including what is found in these 80 pages of the scrolls, Maxwell witnesses from 2016
Birthing of this latest e* set a big pressure on the André Prince, where there is a community between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, mentioned by the small American farmer's sex, confirmed in 2015 in courts that she had been forced to communicate with the Prince André.
The prince Andrés now submits to protect the possibility of information in the week with more damaged requests for his friendship with the childhood Jeffrey Epstein and his medical victor Ghislaine Maxwell.
The American Ombudsman Loretta Preska ordered for a week to show 80 secret legal instruments in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, who count hundreds of pages.
The birting of these highly comprehensive areas would be an appeal for the 58 years old Maxwell, where they have to keep large parts of its testimony before the legislators in 2016, including what its legislators have said are "adequate questions" about her sexual story.
They put a big pressure on the prince André, where one of them contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, mentioned the sex of the small American farmer, confirmed in 2015 in courts that it had been forced three times to communicate with André.
Andrés has repeatedly rejected these confirmations.
A mail from 2015 that has been played and BBC has shown the last year that Andrés has requested Maxwell to respond to Robert’s confessions.
We're not surprised that the soldier will get upstairs.
There he said to the overseer: “Let me know when we can talk, with certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell answered, "There's information. Call me when you've got a long time."
At the evening, a householder who stood near Andrés said: “The Lord of Jordan has done nothing, and we are not concerned about the opening of a courtyard.
Like judges in the United States, it does not mean that the accusation is true even though it appears in courts.
The American courts have encouraged the family and the general to take the most full care of the trials occurring in courts.
We are completely agreed.
We're not surprised that the soldier will receive a full resurrection in the next week."
Maxwell is now in the maintenance of the maintenance in Manhattan and waits for a judge to find and count some of Epstein’s victims under the law from 1994 to 1997.
She is aware of the matter to reject a testimony of his misuse report.
She's rejecting all the requests.
Maxwell was finally discussed with the legislators in April and July 2016 in connection with the Roberts Mediterranean Chairman, who is now under the name Giuffre, which she took up after marrying.
About 40 pages of all 418 were published in the last year, but after the sentence of the judge Presna in New York last week, several of the things were opened first on the fifteenth day.
Lawyers Maxwell received one week to present a depression.
Epstein was found in his prisoner in New York first when he was looking for a right holding for sexual immorality.

Sender wants to take a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, missing Americans in Iceland, wants to have a gun here on the country and wants security.
He said he had been “a warrant ” of his security since he came to the country before.
It appears in a CBS news, where e ́ says that this is the will of Gunter, despite he works in the “one safeest world”.
Gunter has been asked outside the United States Conference to follow the Iceland government that he would be able to bring a gun.
Then he has asked for a busy car and a ship that would be thrown to the rocks.
CBS homes say advice, however, have noticed Gunter that he is not in danger in Iceland.
The CBS report states that outside the Iceland Conference has not provided information about whether the request has been moved from the United States on the possibility of Gunter arms, because the government does not refer to external security consultations.
Although the newspapers say that no request has been made.
Then the CBS has made it after his homes have been told that Gunter should not be looking for arms, because it would be taken as a conquest here in the country.
Gunter is unexperienceless, but he has been a skin dogmaking in California for a year.
He's active in the United States Republic of the United States and a great supporter of Donald Trump, President.
He resurrected a new attention here on the earth when he mentioned “the invisible Chinese season. ”
CBS people say that Gunter has severely reached the United States Missionary Board of Reykjavik.
He had already seen nearby employees in the missionary Council from May before.
He has inter alia commanded them to belong to the "Deep drop" as a network of the American embbitisms that worked in Trump, and he is anxious that one brought snow into his office.
The leader moved to Washington DC in February for the meeting and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, together with CBS home.
Gunter said that he wanted to work from California but that he ended Mike Pompeo, but the American adviser, ordered him to turn back and did it in May.
The home game form is a key for Jose Mourinho, which says Tottenham has a easier game when the responsible is to meet again on the game
With Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur didn't lose a game on the home room since the breakdown was started again, but he says that it would be easier to maintain a good way to home if an appeal was lost in the game.
Spurs has enjoyed 12 circles at this game, but has been lost four times — only one of the six of them that are above — have lost more.
The Portuguese staff said that if such security was possible without the responsibility, it would be easier to maintain it if they were at the place.
"We have to do this with the advertisers. Without them, it is possible to build some kind of activity, where the playing plan is in front," he said.
"But I think it's gonna be more powerful to do with the participants, because it's added to the emotional gate of the game, which is only next by assisting the households."
Mourinho believes that with stronger lips, it will be more difficult to maintain the long safeguards of the house that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built in the last three games.
However, this is also a key step to decide whether to achieve its objectives at the end of the time, especially in games and neighborhoods, where the spirit air on the wall can change creation.
"I think the initiative in the department is that now will be more difficult to kill this improper bill, because they have become good."
"His way is very important to be strong in the house and have finally entered five steps in households."
“I am pleased with the outcome of households, without the deputy, but we are able to get them back.
I'm sure Arsenal's wheel was full of Tottenham's adjoints.
It's a consensus that is built a little and small."

Number of Safeguards in Iceland
"Despite being appointed to the most safe country of the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter was aware of his security since he came to Reykjavik last year."
The CBS News of the United States sentences in Iceland is so, but this army is a number of CBS from the outside of the United States.
The CBS report is noted that Gunter wanted to follow outside the United States Conference that he would have developed a special authorisation for the island government to carry out guns.
Then he wanted to have a busy car, which he had advised the ideas of an appeal that he had warned him for the injection attack.
Without the United States Conference, Gunters refused to declare publicly whether the safety of Gunters is really disappointed in Iceland, but the information of the ambitious people has been reported to Gunter's most of the fact that he is not in any specific danger.
Nevertheless, the recent United States Missionary Council in Iceland was recently held in full work, including the last 18 July in the morning magazine, but the CBS army was made to take care of Gunter’s concern.
Without the United States Conference, it does not refer to severe security activities in their communications, but it generally states that security is safe in preventive ways.
The Council does not answer the questions that Gunters wants to be opened and the Icelandic outside the Council does not mean whether Banda'n has formally wanted to be able to carry out the arms, and it is usually not to take care of the safety of foreign mission firms.
However, the CBS has never been presented to his Icelandic homes that the request of this material has never been stated, and with three American ambassadors, Gunter was undertaken by its plans where they were determined to meet households in Iceland.
In the CBS, the CBS is also aware of the various issues that have been the United States Missionary Council in Iceland since the last year, Gunter was ordered by the missionary lawyer in the last year, but he will already have changed his guardian for six times.
The first warning manager said that he had prepared himself for a long time under his work and learned Iceland only to have been denied of the situations last time, so Gunter “not trusted in him” at their first meeting.
His followers haven't gone much better under the Government of Gunters.
The governments of the United States foreign Council have been informed of the situations of the Iceland Missionary Council, but are involved in dealing with the president's nearby orders.
Furthermore, Gunter says that it is appropriate to apply the various rules outside the service and to respect the authority.
Gunter moved to the Americans in February to participate in Washington's office, and said they have refused to return to Iceland in the village and put their timely stage in their work in the middle of the world.
Mun Gunter has even wanted to get his job in the remote work and is not going to return to Iceland except outside the Officer himself, Mike Pompeo, wanted it specially.
In addition to the information from the United States Foreign Council, Gunter had decided to take personal permission to the meeting of the end and the Coronal Court of Justice for him more, but the CBS's total home would have requested the Gunter to return to Iceland, but it would not have done before May, in the case that Pompeo had been connected to him and requested him to return to the mission of Iceland.
The CBS reports also from the enemy Gunters in Iceland, especially in connections with the tissue, where he calls the Coronavian “Invisible China” and has caused a great impact.
Gunter is one of the numerous, nearly unclean in the area of a missionary service ordered by Donald's Trump American President.

"I don't want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here for people" – Chimaev after historical night on UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The Bardagakapan Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now called the next UFC star after it has been recorded in the story on Fight Island, but he does not say that he is going to strike his wealth in an unfortunate way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev took North-Irann Rhys McKee in their battle in the welfare in Abu Dabi on the summer evening when he won his boat when three minutes and nine seconds were sent from the first shot by putting the high temple on him in the ship.
The cigarette wrote the name Chimaev in historic UFC for the most determined time between the cigarettes in the modern history of the kidney, where only 10 days were lost since he violated the British John Phillips in such a way, then intermediately.
Chimaev, who is with the 8-0, got 50,000 American boons for the presentation of the evening against McKeee and has taken the attention of the MMA House as far as he is now called “Khalib 2.0”, which may say that it is unflyingly compared because of how many are between the overcome of Chimaev and the UFC Master in Left and where he is born in Tethenia, which is close to Khabib's home law in Dagestan.
Despite renewed pleasure and genuine benefits, the Chimaev translated has said that he would not be nice to flag his riches like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his equality in the box world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I do not just this for me, I do this for all I can.
“I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, showing my money or something like that.
I want people to say," Chimaev answered when he was asked about it on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has, inter alia, observed the Conor McGregor partner and acted by the Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote to the community media that he was "easyly" engaging Chimaev with an engineer.
It was not an exciting answer from the fighting captain that was running under the name "Borz", or "doll" of his mother's tethenic question, which said he would "small Danis with a close."
Chimaev, who is now living in Stockholm in Switzerland after having moved to the country for 19 years, is likely a little to go to his famous power, but he is probably unfair to disturb his warfare.
"I can send everyone...
How many warriors are in the welfare?
"I can send them all," he said.
"Give me 77 kilos of masters, 84 kilos of masters, I'll take them both on the same day."

Each fire is not equal, but the recommended Kwicks said that the islamians were called as a wound.
The CBS TV station was running about the issue on his web tomorrow and has followed homes in Washington that Gunter is a persecutor, requires self-employed weapons, injection and armed arms.

Seattle's exhibitor, who believed that Trumps reacted to counterfeits, now says to get a gun after the Starbuck's café house for the bottom of his apartment was destroyed – RT US News
Paul Gallant has received a new viewpoint on violent protests after the Donald Trump American President in June to say that anarchists are burning and running Seattle town.
It was the only thing that was able to get close to the home of the assistant.
"I feel like I wanted to buy my guns so this will obviously take place," said Gallant at Twitter on Wednesday evening after he saw that the rocks had "devastated" the Starbuck's café at the lower height of his holiday.
"Behold, it is enough to come. It looks like the streets under the street from me. Great is now the wrath."
Thus, when Trump tried over it last month, the citizen manager Seattle would allow violent adversaries to overcome the city.
"The free democracy is unclean," said the President.
"The sinners burn and destroy our cities, and they feel wonderful, even the dead."
Gallant, manager of the "Danny & Gallant" partner at ESPN's workshop in Seattle, replied: "Go in there for scientists in the morning and see no burning, random or death.
Gallant said at night that the police had ordered the residents to stay away from his building where the emergency was located in the wounded Starbuck's café house.
He showed pictures of the shadows and said: “What is it that you do, half-witch, ” and he noticed that he had seen the fire for a few houses.
"If you don't have idea of what's going on, but we're going to do with this."
The advertising did not refer to people who claimed that Gallant had before his previous consideration and tithe messages on the table with the "Scale on Laxi" and "Yes, maybe Trump had the right for himself."
Jason Rantz, another exhibitor in Seattle, said, "We will not finally go in this discussion we've discussed."
Gallant said to the green: “Wake and see that the bullet of people was to be cutting on the laxis to me.
He said he was standing at his previous confirmation where he had gone into the CHAZ Sectional Area of Anarchists, and although it wasn't even awkward and it would have been expressed as.
He said, "They were burning, and riding after all." He said, "Don't do it."
White Lines Star Laura Haddock, 34 years of age, in a living search with 28 years of love, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her beloved, Tom Rhys Harries, started at the board of the White Lines, which runs for sugar and swimming on Ibiza, but in the week's holiday search, they were transferred to another and more remote, remote, mildlife of the party.
The parent playing a sister in Netflix-based friendship was seen in Oxfordshire, which is sold at 1.2 million pounds.
They met in the area of Range Rover as Laura, 34, no, increasingly white buxes and white bottles, and found a fixed board that led them into the review of the five rooms of the house.
In the White Lines, which took up the last hole, Laura took Zoe Walker, which was known more darkly at Ibiza's side when she investigated the murder of her brother, the cousin Alex, who was played by Tom, 28 years old.
Their connections were not found in the past this month, within a year since six years of marriage Laura and Sam's finished, but he is known by Hunger Game's films.
They also have the two - year - old son of Pip and the daughter of Margot, who is two years old.
When they announced the difference in August 34, Instagram wrote: “I have decided to understand the law, and we understand love, friendship, and deep respect for our children, and we will keep our relationship with our family.
Laura and Sam first met in the hearing test in 2011, and Sam, who played in Peaky Ånders, described their spouse in 2013 as “hearing anything most of my life”.
Before Laura received her role in White Lines, she had played in the former Inbetweeners film, and in the BBC's lawyer The Capture, which was shown in the past, where she made the lawyer Hannuh Roberts.
Tom took action in the latest Inbetweeners image and in the United Kingdom of Sky.
Numbers too fast to confirm other images here in the country
A specialist in the country-wide area says too quickly to make sure of the other areas of the age.
Three new internal areas were based on the vital part of the Landspital, and they are injured.
Two internal places were found on fifteenth day, otherwise in a thirty-year-old men than in a 20-year-old man.
Then there was nothing to know later at the beginning of the month.
In this way, three internal advocates were found, including one who had been on the Rey Cup in Laugardal.
Johann K. Johnson, the reporter of the Officer, states in conjunction with the newspaper that it had been less able to go to a vision because of the infection that was spoken from the beginning.
Another exhibition is given to a person who came to the country from strangers on July 15.
Then there were rules on such a so-called household.
Camlla Rut Sigfus daughter, a specialist at the National Technology Congregation, states that the attendant, however, followed the old travel.
The appearance of him was not aware of the land, but later he became sick, who came in singleness, and has been set six in trouble.
They are all on the way in the view, but two of them are going to show signs.
The third injury has later been linked to the elder who was found on the fifteenth day and has been placed twelve in anxiety in connection with it.
In the past, there is evidence that a new decline of the coronation that has not been known before in the country.
“We don't know exactly what this virus is coming, but we haven't seen it before.
He who has numbered the virgins to the land was in Israel, and also in the lands of Europe."
She thinks too quickly to confirm that the other so-called billion of the farmer is gone from here in a country like another country in Europe fears.
“When the majority is still rare, there is no food that is.
But we're on the top, and we're going to go with, thinking that we're going to respond if something's something like that's going out."
Megan Fox relates to the connection
Megan Fox says he has found his bicycle in the reporter Machine Gun Kelly.
“In the way I met him and looked at him, then I knew.
I'm interested in the star marks, and I knew that I was talking about my double room," says Fox, who is 34 years old.
"Twice, when the soul has reached enough reality to be able to change into two different body at the same time," explained Fox.
“We are therefore two half of the same soul, I think.
I told him about the way, and we met.
I found it soon."
“ When we had known two days, I asked him to meet me in the holiday and learned him about the stars and asked him to go out to his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same string as they knew when taking a film.
“ I was walking outside her wheel and hoped to see her.
She has the best thing I've ever seen."
Only two months ago, Fox told his husband to 10 years, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye requests Kim's excuses

Increasing weakness in contrasts, genetic injustices in the United States
Contradictors have passed over many towns in the United States to add attention to sexual immorality.
The rebellion has overcome two months in Portland in Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd left the police in Minneapolis in Minnesota.
The Trump Government has sent all agencies to Portland, and there is still known under the contrary.
The protestant will now be the town's groups.
In Seattle on the Wednesday, the police used blue-speeds and gases and handed 45 men, after supporting Portland’s motocicleties were made up in violence.
According to the police, more than 20 police officers were affected.
One was born on the morning evening in the East of Texas when he was thrown by a weapon in Black Lives Matter.
Home family members say that the man knew that he had gone up to the armed rifle before he was shot.
"The nuclear of the matter is that it's important that someone's going to live in the opposite statement," said the city leader Steve Adler, in a statement.
Adler thought he was "what bad and unwholesome".
Lousville in Kentätky needed a group of armed motocals rightly in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman left in Louisville when the police entered her home, with a house without banking, and shot her.
The loving Taylor first had shot the police, because he thought they were a criminal.
One police officer has been rejected because of Taylor's death, but the police haven't been stuck.
For the NFAC group, the armed group of black rebels who have participated in the anti-reports, calls for more benefits in the police investigation of Taylor murder.
In addition to the police information, three NFAC members were sealed on Wednesday when the shooting was shooting for the disorder of weapons.
Possible hepatic inflammation
Five have agreed with Covid-19 smiths this week outside the landscape.
The two of them were discovered in the past, and the origin of three of the five seeds appeared to be totally olious.
Uncertainly, the persons have been dismissed by tourists who have been returned from the country or the unsignificant island, who have probably dismissed them, will be more.
Locational physician states that the potential hepatic infection has been in line with one of the infections.
Two were found with Covid-19 in the last fifteenth day of the country, with what kind of virus.
The origin of the muscles is still olious.
Three were thus identified by the virus; one of them was deceived by the defects of those based on the fifteenth day, another came to the country on the last 15th July and probably outside, but the third is a seal of olive origin.
Following the definition of the Iceland Heritage, two persons who were based on the virus and are linked to the new reactions that have not already been reported here in the country.
Camlla, Joseph’s daughter, a specialist in the country’s homeland area, says that the Icelandic heritage is now to overcome what probably has come to this design of the virus.
“And the other case was decreased in Switzerland, but it was not the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map this better, and they're going to make it like what the world's fucking smiley comes from," she says.
"This seems likely to be here on the side of the Atlantic."
Therefore, the infections are unconnected to the two who came up at the beginning of July and were reported to the United States.
Are you sure that this new drawing has come outside more than to have crafts here?
"Yes, this is different from what has been found here before it really doesn't mean that this has been something to model here," camella answers.
"All of them are like that these individuals have somehow come into the face of a person who is in the outside, without knowing itself."
The question says that there are still no indications on which this new winter has come to the country.
“ It was naturally a traumatism that went back from the country, but it also felt that there was someone who had no signs and doesn’t realize that he had been infected, and then, naturally, there were more defects in the coal.
We're going to be on the next day to take it."
“ Anything has come has not occurred that has been completed.
But there are individuals who went into a swimming relationship with one of the infections of the ships, which have a sign and are ready to go into the show", but Camlla's offspring.
“ We haven’t come with the results of them yet.
So it might have been a illness in the record."
Did you advise that this is a community now?
“ It is not useful.
It hasn't been done but it's not useful, so we don't know who have eaten this football in these persons, which, on the other hand, found on the third day and on the other side." She answers.
Can we talk about that there is a new bill of virus now?
"No, not yet.
But we are naturally aware of being very well - wake, and we think that, though, it is such a specific limit of what we can take many of the views of people.
We don't take evidence in unsignificant people, but first we're getting a bit that seems to be angry to be a little more solve hands by taking a show from people with a sign," she says.
This can be aware of that the cycle and wireological part of the Landspitala is given in the views in the next days to try to map the positions here inside.
Can the State hospital increase the inner views and look forward to the landscape?
“Nothing unlimited, no.
Therefore, it must be a fundamental reason for taking evidence in persons who are not in the skin works; the next must be in anxiety and show a sign or have received a sign and anxiety of having reached someone who is new to the country or something of that, says Camlla.
It concludes that the mixture is still in progress with the injuries that have been found in the loop and that it is now a great job to provide information about the travels of individuals.
She states that the origin of the internal communities seems to be an orphan, but it does not use that any of those who have now been placed in an injury can come with indications that finally lead to the infection team to the original infections.
