Responsible Opposition to the Recurrence of Obama
Responsible leaders have justified their policy for the need for the fight against false choices.
However, in the Centre of Brinan, it is the last myth, saying that the cases of false choices in the United States are more rare than the case of death from a molecular attack.
Furthermore, the Resp Jurisdiers were counted only 300 cases of electoral falses in the United States for ten years.
One can be said with confidence: these new trends will be negatively affected by the electors.
In this regard, such actions are partly discriminating the American Democratic System.
In contrast to Canada, the American States are responsible for the United States Federal Elections.
That is why the majority of States Governments have adopted laws which compatibilize the register or vote process since 2009.
This statement has received a new disruption after elections in November 2010, which have brought 675 new in 26 States.
Only one year 2011, 180 legislative projects were adopted in 41 states.
New election laws require the electoral to provide a certificate of the person with the graph and evidence of the nature of the American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the duration of voting, exercise the right to register the electoral on the Day of Declaration and take the right to vote for the citizens who have jurisdiction.
Before the elections of 2006, no American state had committed the electors to submit the certificate of the identity with the graph.
Indiana became the first state who introduced such a request.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitution of the law adopted in India in 2008.
The Response authorities have succeeded to distribute this issue to other states.
During the last two years, they are initiated by the law projects required by electors to provide certificates of persons with graphs in 34 states.
It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, the American citizens do not have such a universal certificate of identity as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of the American citizens, 21 million people who have reached the need to vote for age, have no validation of the identity of the graphy issued by the Governing Board of their state.
Moreover, five million new electors have no such document in 2012.
In this case, the valuation of the required identity certificate often exceeds hundred dollars.
New impacts are disproportionally affected by young people, minorities, and low income.
In fact, 25 per cent of African people, 15 per cent of people who are employing less than 35.000 dollars, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years old and 20 per cent of electors from 18 to 29 years have no needed identity certificate.
But that's not all yet.
Students who believe that vote for democracy candidates are not allowed in several states and are not allowed to use the personality of the graphy issued by their educational training.
Therefore, these States allow Members of fisheries and Property clubs that vote mainly for the resistance and use for the vote of certificates issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required evidence of the presence of the American citizenship to vote.
The first such request was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws required by electors to prove that they are United States citizens.
These measures are obviously focused on voting from Latin America.
Two thirds of Latin American electors are considered to vote for the Democracy party.
In addition, the Republican legislators initiated in 2011 laws entitled to the electoral register on the day of vote in eight states.
They also had the right of separate persons or groups to provide assistance to those who want to register.
It has not been done without consequences.
For example, during 2004's elections, the campaign on the registration of the electorals helped approximately 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures adopted since 2009 led to 17 per cent of the registration of new electors in 2010 compared to 2006.
The additive of the Republican legislators was adopted in five other states of law aimed at reducing the duration of the vote period.
Yes, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of electors were a long timely afro-American, although only 13 per cent of the total number of national electors.
The same happened with Latin America's outcomes.
Only 11 per cent of electors, they included 24 per cent of citizens who were voting forward.
On the contrary to whites that, by forming 76 per cent of electors, only 46 per cent of the vote were limited.
Of course, democratic legislators and their parties are actively expressed against the adoption of electoral laws.
A number of drafts of laws were blessed by democratic governments.
The most unlikely laws were suspended by the General Prosecutor of the United States.
This allowed partially negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of 34 states were adopted laws required for the certificate of the person with the graphy.
Nevertheless, new rules that have been involved will certainly be difficult for the election of the election right to the elections of 2012.
Democracy critics condemn the prevailing of the laws adopted, seeing that they have a clear direction to affect the results of the 2012 elections in the key states.
The report of the Centre of Brinan from 2011 shows that the states adopting these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidential elections.
Too early to be assured that these legislative changes at the level of the election system will affect the results of the presidential elections of 2012.
Only one uncertain: these new situations will be negatively affected by the electoral.
In this regard, such actions are partly discriminating the American Democratic System.
Screening the race of the present iron: a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives mistakes, false negative, sometimes and false positive results that lead to medical interactions.
Mans, and so it is not the past dissancerism, there is more doubt.
Do you have a test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In the studies conducted in the United States, numerous infections were observed among the investigated groups, so the data received were difficult to interpret and you were difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, for this time, has been found a different level of kvalitet in patients who have passed the scanning, and those who have not passed it.
This study also showed, after 12-year observation, that the probability of 30-40 per cent of the metabolism of those who have not been scanning.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test at the beginning of 50 years, or at 40, if one of the primary relatives had a cancer of prostats.
African men of origin are also higher risks.
At the key time, the decision is to be taken as soon as cancer is found.
Cancer can be as aggressive as well as vital.
The patient needs to explain the risks of cancer disease, without obligation to treat cancer cancer, which does not represent a risk for life in a long-term perimeter, but by choosing, in these cases, in the benefit of active monitoring of disease.
Today, many men who have been discovered cancer will not pass the treatment course because their cancer is not aggressive and does not represent a threat to life.
We will make them active monitoring, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
More frequently, we determine the criteria to make decisions about who should or should not pass the treatment course.
So, I'd like to recommend the test.
But it is important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not this test is required.
In collaboration with the International Urology Association, Moviember created a tool to evaluate everything for and against the testing of the PSA.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonder to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific studies, the health care of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is considered that if all people were healthy and moved enough, 30 per cent of cases of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one would smoke anymore, this number would grow up to at least 50 per cent," stresses Andre Bole, press secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, 10 per cent of the cases of cancer have been estimated in heritage.
Some types of cancer remain perfectly unexplainable.
The Canadian Cancer Association remains a priority, despite decreasing the number of pupils.
It is 85% of the cases of cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It brings the colossal health of people.
"Thus today in Quebec, 1,5 million bulks are counted," says press secretary Andre Bole.
Expected fact: In 10 years after refusing to breathe the risk to die from cancer, half is reduced.
Weather
According to the CAR, the weight and heating also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of the race of milk rail, dust and straight cup, food, subjugation of iron and mothers.
"The investigations are that the regulation of physical activity throughout the life protects from the cancer of silver kiss," adds the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends the consumption of red meat.
In too large numbers, it increases the risk of the emergency of the cancer of a thick cartridge.
It should also be avoided from colbatic products.
Conservation of meat by pressing, sugar or salt can lead to the training of cancer plants.
"Latests can bring the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," explains the Association.
Vitamin
In recent years, many scientists studied the impact of vitamin additives on the development of cancer.
But at this time the results of these studies are one-signed.
According to SCC, vitamin studies E have contrary results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostat development, the other resulted in the opposite.
Assessing the impact of vitamin D cancer has also no full clearness.
However, Mr. Bolo stresses that its concerns and family anonymous are important to discuss with the doctor.
"The success of the analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Higgs Bozon in Detail
Last year, the report that scientists may have been able to find the Higgs boss, has caused a real injury - not without any responsibility.
It seems that this bozon explains the mass of all parts in the universe, not much.
Moreover, it is after the part of which the employment was predicted in the Standard Model is our best, or, in any case, "the least incompatible" description of the nature and the behavior of the material, which was not able to be found in the experienced way.
But the physicians have not yet been sure that he's talking about the Higgs boss.
We know, without doubt, that we have a real new part and that it is very reminded of the Higgs Bozon, which is predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, the new data presented on one major figure of the Conference in Kioto at this week confirms that some of the data are not yet available for full confidence.
However, let's imagine what to say about the Higgs boss, because the chances of wrong seem to be minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is perfectly unsecure, that two things cannot be made at the same time.
It does not have any opportunity to do this rule, nor do you try to be too proud, else to yourself.
But although the physician of elementary parts is enough strange in the world, it also shows that there is one law of the same nature: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which puts out that two parts cannot take the same space at the same time, if they remain in the same "quant status" is "so" in general, in some of their characteristics.
From this, physicians divide parts in two categories.
In one angle, we find well-ordinated citizens called farmers who are well-likely subject to the principle of Pauli.
In other cases, bozones, an annuist band that do not respect anything, at least to this principle, meaning that they can be quietly in the same time.
As the site reports, Particle Adventure Laboratorium of Berkli, these bozones are divided, in their range, to two groups: the areas that we will not speak here, and the "participants of power" through which the main natural powers are extended and to which the Higgs bozon is in some kinds.
These most bozones should be highlighted, not all exotics as could be considered.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, this is a most probably banal bossone: an "party of the light", which is "cowerer" of electricity power.
In fact, when a part of the electrical stock has or changes the direction, it "shares" the electrical field in this specific area, such as the stone brown in the dust.
From this "protection" is born a electrical wave (light, or infrarroad exhibition, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wheel is nothing else like it is - and therefore one of the bosons of "power transferers".
More Stable Field
The same happens with the Higgs boss, with the only difference that to make this boss appears, the other field, the Higgs field must be "forwarded".
However, the field of Higgs is much, much more stable electricity of the field; to raise it, it is necessary to reach very high energy, as if it were to be about the swimming powder that the surface could only be cut a very large stone.
That's why a great holder of parts, such as those who are exploited in the CERN, the Great Adron Collyder, which is a ring with a diameter at 27 km! - to achieve such great energy.
Analogia with electrical fields is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boss and the mass.
In fact, not all parts or materials are involved in the electrical field.
For example, such as õniths, others are involved, and others are not: the paper list, for example, will never be held on the cold.
Likewise, not all parts are interacting with the field of Higgs: those who interact with it have a mass, but others do not have it.
• What, then, is "the possibility of bringing" all these investigations, asks Mrs. Platondon?
In science they are used to verify the correction of the Standard Model (MM), which also allows the physicians to distort the results of monitoring and prognoses.
Moreover, some of them wish to find that such disturbance, such as the smallest incompatibleness, can open the door for "new physics" and shut down some model dirs.
After saying, there is still a deficiency, without any explanation for gravity (oh!) or for a dark material that forms approximately 80 per cent of the Universe (oh!).
But until the CERN has found such destructions.
Consequences
According to these studies, the human medium-state of life would be more difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that it was not.
See: At the beginning of the 60 ’ s, the pioneers in the Bella labs could not even imagine what revolution they would call on.
They predicted their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, the peaceful physician Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Laboratories, where the layer was exhausted in 1960, and who was the first uninterrupted laser (the previously impulsed) in 1962, said that the lazer was considered as "laboratory gage".
Imagine...
Furthermore, the application can be found for an investigation tool.
For example, the same Willyard Boyle during its optical studies in 1969 had a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not his original purpose, now serves as a " eyes" for all digital partners of the world and has deserved the Nobel Fisic Premium for 2009.
This, of course, doesn't mean that the work of the Great Adron Colleder would have to change the life, but it just shows that everything could be.
Paliative assistance is the best way to die...
The Commission had recently discussed a delicate issue of the end of life in Quebec.
The debates in the field should be renewed and the legislative project will be prepared at that time.
However, there is much more to do in this important area.
"Long" tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived in his apartment in Monteregi.
The cancer of prostats that disrupted it inside has been repeated for two years.
"I gave me five years, I lived in seven," he says, between life and death, lies in bed in the arrest of Victor-Gadbua's palatiative entry in Belarus, where the punishment came.
"But it's always a shock, it's not going to be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes its own: an incredible ability that does not allow to walk into the train and even to eat itself.
Sit behind the table on which the appetite dinner is set up and agreed to help him take food.
He's worried, even disturbing to smile, talking to strangers who work around him, bringing him medicines, leading him to the bathroom.
Much before normal death.
"My greatest desire to cure me from the diarrhoea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a medicine from that disease.
"In our lives, we learn that a man must stand," says Peter Broder, psychologist in Victor-Gadbua.
Regresing to the status of the child is an unnecessary humiliation for some.
"All depends on the ability of man" to be calm with an accident, he says.
Since many people believe that they are involved in a palyative approach, the important events are also in the most degree of this accident.
Patients who take advances to the palyative Victor Gadbua are all sick with cancer.
Prognoses take them three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and sisters does not provide any more assistance called "therapy".
Mrs. A., 89 years of age, most often feared to die "in a sense of death."
But the sickness allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything more in my life," she says before he allows her to put a mask that makes it easy to breathe.
She continued in the nearest days of her son's last visit, who came from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbua's receipt, the volunteer group provides access to the body and food assistance.
This is a paliative approach that remains when nothing more can do.
To make death more comfortable.
Each 11 700 inhabitants in Quebec is one place in paliative aid institutions.
It's very little, considering that we're all going to die early or quietly.
Here the life continues in the best conditions as they are, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the receipt.
Be comfortable, physical, emotional or mental.
When we die, we will agree to deliver bottles from the boat or the pepse, seeing that he will ask.
The diabetes are not allowed to control the level of sugar anymore.
And death is part of the world.
We brought a bird to Mr. H. that died tonight.
In the morning, his son dropped this bird in the feet of the rest.
"We help closer as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, director of hospitals.
Victor Gadbua's advice doesn't look like a previous day.
A group with a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the court, putting on his pockets during his toast, tragically died a young man 36 years old, circumcised by parents, wife and two small children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last half of three to five cooks, always occupied by cancer diseases in age to 45," Dr. Christian Martel says carefully.
53 per cent of patients receiving Victor Gadbua are from home, and 47 per cent of the hospital.
Problems of access to paliative access
77% of the canadians simply do not have access to a paliative access, meaning that it is allowed to facilitate the suffering of diseases in their final stage, either at home, in the hospital or in the hospital.
And some institutions such as Victor-Gadbua and the Community of paliative income in the house of the Great Monreal are specialized more or less exclusively on the income of cancer diseases.
This large space in the Health System of Quebec provides many doctors, experts on the paliative entry, to threaten the adoption of the law, which enhanced evtanasia and self-sociation assistance.
The beginning of October circles a mannifest signed by a paliative entry area, Dr. Balfur Mount and Dr. Bernarom Lapoant, and testifying about their non-initiativity with such initiative.
According to Dr. Cristian Martel, the health protection system of Quebec is not sufficiently effective to ensure the right to a high-quality paliative approach before the transition is allowed.
Recently, - she says, - I have seen a patient who has spent 14 days in the rapid assistance, in the disease of the diseases, and no one has taken the measures to facilitate them.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get a suitable outcome.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients, despite pessimistic predicts.
The hope for the survival of Elen Richard was already minimal when she stopped the extinction of the chemotherapy.
When I reported to my onkologist that I stop treatment, she answered me that I was sorry to stop fighting, she says.
In that way, she told me that my days were counted!
There is no exit.
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of patients who ask for death thanks to the medical staff because they did not comply with their request, after the paliative entry team facilitates their pain.
However, it is necessary to note that the paliative approach is not absolutely complete in the fight against pain.
According to Elsey Monroe, the Paliative Entry Director in the Community of Paliative Income on the Grand Monreal House, patients are not acceptable to security in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors are often running to a paliative seat where the patient sleeps until his death, or at times, or continually.
Unless we do more, we don't know about these suffering.
More frequently and more, because those who cannot facilitate the pain are able to have access to a paliative seat.
Because those who suffer from pain always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to make my evtanase," that means "I want to become more coherent."
This report has become a rational grate to the journalist grant of the Canadian Health Survey Institute.
Great scale scandal in Quebec
The responsibilities responsible for the building of roads, building subordinators, collecting political party funds and the Italian mafia specialists quoting dayly tells them what they know about the colossal " system" of building industry, public servants, politics, professional operators and mafioses.
Industry, which was very valuable to the Quebec payers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It is interested in how this system is spent after all the funds have been released, Jacques Dusheno, deputate and former police head of Monreal."
Exactly thanks to him, in 2011, the scandale was discovered as a result of the investigation of office crimes held in Quebec with road-building contracts on which the Prime Minister on that time of Liberals, Jean Share, agreed very neo.
"Dusheno ' s report has established a primary relationship between industry, secret policy partying and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he highlights that only the Ministry of Transport would keep a billion dollars on contracts," if some hold their instincts to take part.
The Commission of Charbonno "has already mixed two members" adds, hoped that she will "hide the schemes that remain behind the persons".
Permanent Division on the Conflict of Corruption established in 2011
The case was established in 2011 by the Permanent Department for the Conflict of Corruption, which included an extensive State of Governing Auditors, Surveys and Analytics.
Moreover, Montreal's special department " Molot", which postponed the "stock card" after 2009, stops the degree of the valuation of contracts.
During the last weeks, a series of investigations was made, and some municipal officers, in particular Frank Zampino and Rishara Market, a small town, were accused of moving and corruption.
On the other hand, Gile Wayankur, who was recently departed from the city of Laval, the third by the province of Quebec.
It is suspicious of receiving a repeated debt in the place of public orders.
Furthermore, the official accusation was granted to several engineers by the communication of Montreal and the building of the Italian origin, including Tony Akcurso and Lino Zambito.
The last exploded the actual bomb, following the "system" of the receipt of State contracts.
During a few years, Zambia granted 3 per cent of the rate of contracts held in Montreal, a mediator with mafia, which, in turn, transferred the money of Mr. Gerald Tramble's party of the "United Monreal".
In the 2000 ’ s, Zambito was charged with money on the right and on the left, and he recalculated more than 80,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000) to the different parts of the province, in particular the liberals of the authorities.
Moreover, he admitted that he had illegally collected funds for the former Prime Minister of the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
Canalisation contracts with higher value
In Montreal, corruption worked unrelevantly.
Gile Surprenan, former civil building engineer, described it before the Commission: for ten years, he received from the building firms of gifts, invitations in the trains on the golf, in restaurants, in hocking and in general complication of $736.000 in exchange for the channel contracts that he has increased.
Other officers responsible for the building of roads recognized that they had received a lap, exceeding 30-40 per cent with false supplements.
Thereafter, one organizer from the March party, Martin Dumon, accused Mr. Tromble that he had closed his eyes to the employment of a parallel budget, which filled partial cash with money.
After these revelations, Mr. Tromble went to the delay at the beginning of November, and led Montreal to a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputats in Montreal, killing anxiety.
Mar of the River de-Pray region on the east island, it is opposed to the sale of a munitional share buyed for $5 million and re-selling for... 1.6 million building officers from 2010.
70 per cent of money in pre-selected campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which finally will be started, it will "determine the point that it can understand the functioning of the system of mugs to stop the gangrena and determine the guilty."
This process is characterised as "felicited, but strict".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will be a own investigative group and monitor to avoid the return of the doubts.
How we're going home.
Reg.
Jacques Dusheno notes that "the workers stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but especially fears the role of "elected officers, knowing about this scheme," but not participating in the disabilities.
Since the share of money in the Implementation of the electoral campaign in Quebec reaches 70 per cent, he shouts: "I said that it was just a blue reality reflection."
The Government of Quebec will pay up up to 100 dollars for parties, but it will not change the situation: "Before we will be able to make the election costs, the political money will be lost."
He requires a full restructuring of the State contracts and party supply system: "We can't go down; we'll be able to build a house on a more swift bundle, with a better control and legislation."
If this story and put the darkness on the Quebeck and Montreal image, Mr. Dusheno calls those who smile to watch in their own court...
"PSI isn't the FC Barcellon!"
In this season, you've got an incredible breakdown in the PSH.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual knowledge, but may also by a new measure of PSH.
There are big players.
I'll be with them every day.
Technical staff has also been a lot of advantages.
These factors make me up the level of my game every day.
And in the morning, it's easier.
Everything happens very quickly in the football.
But I'm not burning.
From the beginning of the NIF preliminary training center in Clerphonten and before my arrival to St. Ethan, I have always passed forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition installed by Carlo Anchelotti...
The full of this year is not to play a very high level of maturity.
They also know that each training is very important.
This leads to that such a player like me, wants to be at the level and to be trained by mom.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti supports my position.
He helped the substitutes such as Claudele, who played in the same position as me.
Anchelots are a gentleman of situations?
Of course.
Anchelots have respect for all the technical staff.
He has no members today in the First Law, and he is involved in the number of best trainers.
He has an extensive experience, and he has won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he's gonna bring new titles in Paris.
In January, I had a hopeful conversation with him.
Then I went out of the whole series of traumatisms.
The confidence he shows me also explains my achievements.
What are you thinking about the first part of the PSG?
Leon took the place of the leader in the First League.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champion Liga: we have been effectively qualified in one eighth final.
What is the goal of the club in this tour?
We're trying to pass as far as possible.
It can be all right now.
We can say our word to face with very good Peace teams.
We want to end the first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take a responsible point in one eighth final.
Should the SGS become the first-class club in a short-term periphe?
He's already got a budget for this.
In order to become a major club, Paris needs to win titles and strengthen the positions for a long-term per-per-per.
That's not right today.
Financially, the PSG has a means to make this project real.
Don't take the title in the First Law, like last season, will it be a big fall?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
In this year, we really want to get this campaign title.
We were close to this last season.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to come to the end of the first.
It was a very happy season.
We finished him with 79 eyes.
Normally, 79 points suggest the call of champion.
But the other team, Montpele, played a more statistical season.
This year, I think it'll be okay.
Despite the fight against the title, such as Marsel, Leon and Bordo, I think we have power to win.
Don't you think the MI's waiting too much from the SSH?
It's normal that we expect a lot, taking into account the amount of players and players we have.
We're completely ready to do this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua, and yet we find what to discover, of course, it's a little disturbing.
We question what people first expect from us.
We will never be able to win each output with account 4-0.
We're not the FBI of Barcelona!
We're trying to introduce the game project.
The command is formed with time.
We have proved in the Champion's League that we can respond to modern calls.
Look at Manchester Younaite, whose two seasons haven't been able to pass to one eighth final, although they have also spent great money!
In view of the sums added, we represented you for 15 points forward to winter breakdown.
It would be a disturbance to our opposers and to France's campaign.
Leon and Marsel, who were not at the highest of the past season, were "expulsed" by this new SGS.
This shows how attractive the First League is.
I hope we'll be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we've wined.
PJ, fully depends on the highlights of the Golden Ibrahimovič.
Well, what if they say there's some gold dependence.
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he forgets much.
He came for this and proved that he was the star of the First Life.
Where he was playing, he showed that he was a big player and a world-scale star.
In the group, we view him as a human and player.
He also respects people around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This stimulates others to improve their game.
The Thiago Silva, who is one of the best protectors of the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive with France's collection?
It's like a disappointment.
I wanted to teach it bitterly.
Unfortunately, my trauma struck me to break a little game time.
I saw many things there, and I went out there more.
I can play good choices today.
That's what I hoped since my baptism in Sinai.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must be a model.
What do you think about the first months of Dide Descham in the chapter of Blue?
They're resulting for him.
He has good positions in the election group to the world's champion.
He's a strong trainer, he's close to players and inspires the winning.
What was Laran Blan.
But I wouldn't like to compare.
Blan has reached his goal, he's a quality of us in our own.
I hope Didee Desham will bring Sinai to Brazil.
The good deserved nine (1-1), issued on 16 October in Spain, is a basic mad?
This bitch believes in us.
Everyone fighted for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, my career had no such mads.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
The full opposition to the current daily exchange in the centres of transactions between the parties receiving the Commission collections on their own.
Moreover, how often these technologies occur, it is obviously political vision: the conviction that the current monetary system of bank monopoles leads to financial crisis.
Actually, Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto (psewdonimo), is at the same time a virtual currency (but converted to dollars, ...) and a protected BitTorrent exchange protocol, which allows the exchange of files between participants of one level.
Approximately 200 000 operations have already been registered from 15,000 computers on the network.
There are thousands of sites to be battled for employment or as an asset.
In June 2011, 5 months later, before returning to approximately 10 dollars (curses indicated on the bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing especially in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the Central Bank (ECB) was interested in its report on virtual currency held in October.
It describes the bitkin as "the most successful virtual currency", "concurrent with a dollar or Property" and "common currency".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credits" used for moving in video games that are employed in the game process or which may be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network also had a similar system.
However, exchange operations always control and process any central body.
In Bitcon, all the networks are included by accounting book containers, auditors, currencies, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each trade between two users actually occurs between two email addresses, such as the e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus ensure anonymity.
The set of information related to this agreement is signed electronicly using the dual key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The content of the file may be checked that the battles used in the negotiation are actually available in the public account book broadcast throughout the network.
The key is registering the new transaction in this book.
It takes the decision of the task that has been sent by computers, which, like the timely central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
Specifies and about the phase of the file hashing, which means the conversion of a large file to a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers will take a new transaction and add her number before "hashing" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other nodes easily check that it's right.
The transaction is thus anxious with all other transactions; any mode will change the digital signature.
If the user would want to pay two times with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be under the network - and the other would remain ununderstanded, because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that decided the task is 50 bits.
In order to avoid inflation, the recompense of the retail will be divided to halfs, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitkins in the treatment is therefore 21 million, but they share up to one million, which remains in the reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increased in calculating power.
The network's life has already survived up and fall.
Bitcoin services sites were attacked and battles were stolen from reserves.
"The exposed defect is not covered by the same protocol," says Peter Nuaza, who recently started Paymium - a real money company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of reimbursement of money through this anonymous service.
But the money is also insufficient.
Great players, such as Wikipedia, are refused to accept such practices.
Others, such as blog-plate WordPress, allow them.
Recently, Addie Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Witzman Institute in Israel, analysis of the account book and discovered that almost 80 per cent of the battles were not in the shopping.
"Gigantic sales" was announced in November.
"Tryty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist works in Coinabul, who is being converted into gold.
Pier Nuaza, another asset author for this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent to a credit card (in current money) or an uncontakt payment via a phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions that thus come out of the phone.
The equipment is better controlling its personal data and thus can be anonymous.
The system is simply to provide businesses who do not need to install new devices or software.
It's enough to report the address that can be "fotographed and recognised" by the phone that Pier Nuaza has already been assured that there are thousands of users.
There is a general trend to reveal hierarchy systems in favour of more horizontal.
"Before Bitcoin will be approved for a while, but 2013 can be a return moment," he suggests.
In its report, the ECB suggests, in the case of the success of this system, to review the various risks that today are considered higher.
We went out of Afghanistan.
What else?
The French army left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Suroba).
The NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghanistan Army, there was time to return control over its territory, and for the Afghanistan to choose their future without only hope for us.
We have suffered most of the Afghanistan baptisms that we considered as terrorists .
And we, with 88 murdered soldiers, were hurt and calamities.
Taliban consists of foreign extremists, such as commanders, hidden in Pakistan, but also often from baptisms who reject the presence of the foreign army, as it was in the SSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaetics, even joihadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Ushbeki, Tajikians.
They are patient, sometimes helped them to resurrect, but they will not be anymore if the West will be more delicate.
The outcome of the French army from Nidgerab, which I observed from the height of the hills of the mineral trees by the French credits, was fine.
The carriers and the broadband convoys reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, the cabul is not going to be .
Conditions have changed from the time of their immediate transition from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Cabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
Taking them under the control of the country was then considered their kind of freedom, return to security.
Afghanistan women were paid for the darkness of these baptisms, in which they were overcome Al-Qaida, but their situation was not improved in our day.
The former Modgeade, the Afghanistan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to maintain women in the underlying town.
The basic persons of the Antisociete War returned to the authorities in 2001.
They were converted to the dealers capturing the country to sell them under the construction of repatriants who returned from Iran and Pakistan using the amazing American subordinate contracts.
They are discredited; most of them did not even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in agriculture, want a government that would not be of the bodies.
Many young people want to leave the way those who have seen American kindness: the capital father is significant.
Young people have risen from war and its ideology.
They lived in the present world during the release of Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated his benefits.
Approximately 65 per cent of the population are age to 25 years; 5 million people are now counted in Cabul, one fifth general population.
State schools in towns are filled with boys and girls.
It is necessary to ensure the workplaces of these young people who will not be able to return to the darkness of old partys or to the corruption of some rulers.
All, including armed fighters, love the phone cells, television and Turkish, we are the opers representing the modern world and looking around.
Now there's an army.
Will the authorities who will be commanded be deemed to be sensitive?
Old commanders who lead to antisociety have already taken measures to restore provincial women that would not be subject to the central authorities.
Afghanistan, the Montenegro, with the distinctions of §, should be dealed up to a certain degree of the western countries, but the United States wanted to convert it to a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, eliminating the post of the Prime Minister, which had been held since the Constitution of 1964.
The President Carsay does not want foreign control, especially before the elections set for April 2014.
But his country, beginning from the 50s, even before, depends on foreign assistance.
Industrie has not been placed on the feet, no flesh works, no irrigation system has been remonted.
Everything is imported; nothing is happening except fruit and fibres.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In the country disrupted for thirty years of war, government control over the infrastructure would be.
The audience that Afghanistan has managed great mineral riches.
This only strengthened the feeling that western countries were there to be there only to take them.
Without energy for rail or medium recycling, without transport means to export them through the mountains, there are no exhausted gains.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the location of Media, and they have left the geologists (financed by the World Bank) to speak of a huge Buddhist complex and to remain the most major workers of the province.
It is also necessary to restore the standards of Afghanistan and Pakistan on a single day, from which the imports and exports are largely dependent.
The conclusion of the French fighting divisions ended on 20 November.
The new Co-operation Treaty provides the maintenance of traditional assistance: persons for girls, boys, French language faculty at the University, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural sectors, support of the delegation.
Since 2009, in the aim of "building hearts and minds" and to carry out the non-processful task of associating assistance with operations, the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was held in 2012, together with the small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agricultural home in tens of mountains.
These works, with intensive enforcement of the force slaves, were able to help maintain the resurrectedness of: rocking, drinking water, rebuilding forests, phytophictic trees, protection of landscape and increased areas of landscape.
What will we leave for the memory of us to pay two billion for military expenditure?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of the lives of the population, very severe in these valleys of more than 2,000 metres above the sea level.
The company received decades of written requests for small agricultures from the communities in the Cabris province.
In order to be released from the resurrects of foreign groups, what farmers want, as they said to me, need to give them a little unfair support that would be well controlled and worked at them.
Hard species of the Constitution of Egypt
This is the new risked step of President Muhammed Mursi.
While Egypt was divided more than ever, on the basis of a constitutional declaration which temporarily gives him excessive powers, he decided to play a va-bank.
He declared in the middle of all the expansions that the Presidency assembly would vote on the Day of Research.
A week ago, the head of the State before the assembly was two additional months to end.
Soon two years ago, as Egypt refers to a preliminary text, in which several times amendments have been made, which decreases the institutional stability and leads to legal oppositions.
This new initiative only strengthened the country's separation.
According to its representatives, the Chairman refers to his "autocraft" board, "continuing to distort this word" and "support right".
His followers' camp are sure that this is a way to end institutional and political crisis through transitional process.
Reference should be carried out for fifteen days.
A very short period of time that allows the brothers to refuse to explain the text to Egypt, the article of the article.
For the President, this is also a way to restore public and democratic ability, while the deficiency is over the whole country.
Muhammed Morsey, assured that the Egyptians are voting locally as he stated in one of the American Week Interviews to Time.
More than the call for a vote is to the Ultimate of the Egyptian people: "If you vote for my text, or I will remain in the powers of emergency," which, likely, should be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Advocate Assembly, mostly islamists, have voted for text yesterday.
Most Liberals did not respond to calls.
Meanwhile, before the Constitutional Declaration, they dressed the door, feeling that they were not able to bring their opinion.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to make the currum, 11 persons, reserve participants, were successfully added yesterday.
It's very close to the Muslim brothers.
Not surprisingly, most of the cases of the article were voted uniformly.
The commentators, however, concluded that one of the few differences of the day came around... time for prayer, since some members of the Committee considered that the times of the Presidency Assembly were wrongly set up.
The text for which the vote was yet held last night is consistent of 234 articles.
The Object of universal attention, Article 2 finally remained an identical article of the Constitution of 1971, which claimed that "the principles of the chariation I'm a fundamental source of rights."
Salafist partys, for which the introduction of the Islamic Rights is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principes" by "regulation" that would give them a more closer application.
For islamists the fact that this article has not been changed is a witness to their good will and respect for others of the Egyptian society.
"Licemery" replies to the libraries that see only a piece in it.
Because they believe that the islamization of the Constitution is being made through other articles.
They indicate, in particular, Article 220, which provides advisory role to the University of Al-Ashar, in particular, in the case of verification of the conformity of chariat laws.
According to the Egyptian Specialist Sophie Pomea, this calls for anxiety, e.g. "The people who are called to make decisions are not chosen and have no democracy."
We can watch the theocracy's birth."
Many libraries, besides, are built by the fact that the recorder of this university seems to be less moderate than the current.
"There is no specific religious involvement at present.
With this constitution, we remain in the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not unclean, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system, "becoming alone's Bloe, who prepares the discipline for the constitutional transition of Egypt.
But he recognises that "environment of article 220 may occur inequality, since the terms used in it are acquired of religious lessons.
This will happen in particular to the "fichs" [Islam's jurisdiction, - in order].
And in the future there may be a question of how competent citizens are to make decisions."
Besides its religious and religious, the text adopted yesterday is critical because it gives the width powers of the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced in comparison with what was in the old regime.
Another time: Army powers.
In the case of military desires, the exam of the defence budget will be not in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
It will also not be prohibited to judge civils in military courts, despite requests for human rights protection associations.
The last have also expressed the emphasis on the conduct of the text that they consider to be lost for freedom.
The responsibility for divinity has been maintained and has now been prohibited for the decree that may have serious consequences for the freedom of word, especially for the freedom of pressure.
Furthermore, none of the articles speaks about the protection of a woman, emphasizes Heba Morrayef from Human Rites Watch.
According to her, at the only time I will prohibit torture in article 36.
The word not appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak last night on television, the manipulation was planned today in the second half of the day.
Parties of the head of the State will, in their own way, go out on the road on the Sabbath.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Poop of Earth and the sea from the race
The Promised Earth consists of Bible truths, modern comfort and primary nature.
The AIF has provided the five most important reasons for staying in Israel.
Worship in the Holy Place
It is worth staying at the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It seems that all who enter into this “group ” are decreased by God’s favor.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: the conversion of water to wine, the walking of water, the calamity of the storm, and the fullness of the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of the saints in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here go through the Scorbie Road or the Baptized Path of Jesus (in Latin Via Dolorosa).
He begins with the strength of Antonia - Pretorium, where he was judged, and by the Old City he brings to the Throne of the Lord's Grave on the Mount Golgofe - to the Rispitium, the Stone of the Old City and to the sepulchre of Jesus.
There is a symbolic Christian Poop of Earth that symbolizes salvation.
And the sanctuary of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be raised up to the place where, according to the Christian End, the tree was grown from which they made a cross for Jesus ’ breaking.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews, the wall of Plach, left from the temple that was disrupted by Romans in 70 C.E.
According to the tradition, people of different statements remained records with desires that are then fulfilled.
Make a vertical traveling
The ruins of Massada's strength remained from a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on the mountains in the mountains at the height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And they can reach their homes only those who are attractive to alpinism.
The rest of this historical top will have a lot of traveller on the canatic road.
And on the north of the country, 1600-2040 m, there is a famous horn-shirt, Hermon, on which the winter months are a huge attack of tourists.
To him from the bottom of the mountain is the bus-sha.
The total duration of the cross-border traces is 45 km.
According to the elderly tradition, the mountain is like the Jewish gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museum
In this country, about 300 museums.
You don't live for one hour in everyone.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is nearly from Knesset (parlament).
It contains the older Cumran manuscripts, or the mer of the sea, found in the Jewish wilderness pigs, and about 500 thousand of the geological and antiological experts.
It must also be in the Museum of experiences in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition is largely represented by a lot of imprisonists and expressors of Mona, Pissaro, Renuar, Sezanna, Sislea, Mathissa, Modelians, Shagala, Picaso.
Akko can be held in the Al Basha Museum, which represents a number of old Turkish bans with visitors and banks at that time.
Caesarea should be entered into the unique part of the Rally Museum, where you can love Dal and Roden's sculptures.
There are no experts and suvenir lawyers.
The income is free, and the income is not classically accepted.
The fifth is Holocost Museum or Jad-Yous in Tel-Avive - relates one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the memory of 1,5 million of children's concealers and gas cameras.
You're coming into it, and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are running.
And the names of the children of the Jews and the names of the lands where they died.
The Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healing
Three main curort zones of Israel are divided in the Mediterranean, Red and Mer.
Each of them has bases, aquaparks, delfinary and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea are buyed even in winter months, since water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees of warmth and air is spent to 23 degrees.
The sea is still the sea, and there is a round year.
Instead, this is the world's most increasing sea is on the lowest point of the planet -- at 417 m below the ocean level.
There is a lazy water in it, which is easy to keep on the floor even those who are unable to flee.
Paisages around are incrediblely beautiful.
It's coming here to take a course of treatment with salt water, ra, and targets, and to treat health in diet, allergies, asthmas, ecstasy, arthrites, bronhites, sugar diabetes, so that they may be in a manner of harmful nerves.
To touch the secrets of ancient times
They keep the old part of Tel-Aviva, the town of Jafo in the Mediterranean.
It was the most famous way of the Sea, which consisted of Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Apothemia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian Ends.
According to the traditions, Noah built his ark here, and Persei saved the beauty of the Andrew, with which they lived here with a happy and happy life.
The tourists love to swallow on the rocks called Zodiaca's signs.
They're saying, if you're looking at the walls on the street of your sign, Fortuna's going to be a favor.
Young women who come from all Israel and even other countries can be met at the meeting in Jafo.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, we can be deceived by the Roman theater, "take" the strength of crossnotes.
Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontia Pilate.
The strictly restored theater is now used for dinner concerts and oper axis.
_Other Organiser
When sending you to Israel, don't be afraid of your incompatible English: approximately 30 per cent of people know Russian language in the country.
The money in the train is better to take not in Property, but in dollars that are easily exchanged in the shock (for now 1 dollars - 3.8 shekels).
The urban transport is mainly the bus, but there is a fast tramway in Jerusalem, and in Haife the only metro line in the country consisting of six centuries and the low city with the top.
In fact, it's a subground funiculator.
The transition in all types of city transport costs six shekels that can be driven to travel over 1,5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition on the Sabbath is a Sabbath.
From Friday to Sunday in the morning, markets, stores, public transport interrupts.
And on Sunday the morning begins a week's work.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only a coffee food, excluding swine, marine products, fish without chess and feed in which milk is combined with meat.
There are a large choice of ships and bovines, are and desserts prepared on cocos milk, the traditional Jewish past humus, the various susses, the bullet nuts, the fatal, the fibres and the fruits.
There are no shiping dogs in the cities of Israel.
So, a lot of fresh bottles that "smooth themselves."
On the evening, they can be seen as sleeping even on the cottons of parked cars.
The murderers love people's places and do not refuse to gain.
The car arend, depending on the mark, will be from $37 to Sunday (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 per day.
And the wheelsipedia's going to be at 15 shops a day.
Museum billets are in the middle of 30 shekels.
Digital Language

On the Earth promised from January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists were born, 51 per cent of the 2010 analogue indicator, before rejection of 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" will lead to Moscow: migrants copy money in language
Until deputates and defenses will have the law on the commitment language testing, the country has already appeared in the marketing of "lip" certificates
Any year, in Moscow, Petterburg and other Russian cities come 13 million guestbaitors.
Most of the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their only goal is to pay money for family support, remaining in the family.
Since 1 December, the law has entered into force, which every worker migrant will have to give an exam of Russian knowledge.
As long as this rule works only for those who work in the field of service, housing and community, bite and different trade.
However, at the time, they promised that the tests would be committed to all arrivals.
Thereafter, not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the basis of the law of the law.
The knowledge of the language should be confirmed to receive and to extend the authorisation.
Exception only works for the citizens of the countries where Russian is a public language.
It is not subject to the law and people who have succeeded in receiving attempts and diplomas on education until the SSR is devastated in 1991.
Use, accuracy and protection of rights
The Network of Examen items will work under the Egyptic Russian Institute of the Puskin, the University of the People's Friends, the MGU, the BGU and other Russian opinions.
The testing of migrants is smoked in all cities; there are now more than 160 centres in Russia.
The testing initiative also supported the deputates of the House, and the MSS.
And these rights-guardians, before the law entered into force, have been able to ask the question: What will it give?
What will change the obligation of knowledge of the language and for the Russian and for their own arrivals?
Firstly, the representatives of the migration service are responsible to reduce the number of people suffering from "a hard slavery".
A lot of people now speak about the protection of the rights of work migrants, explains the role of the representative of the Russian FMI in Tadjikistan Victor Sebeljev.
The protection of their rights should be started until they go away.
Only the organized set system will allow 90 per cent to solve the problems of foreign slaves.
Problems occur in migrants without training, education, non-known languages, without medical witnessing.
Without understanding of the language, Sebelev is certain that the future migrant is obliged to be with non-conscious people who, as a result of the help, will have a "way" to a worm bar, where he and the tens of the likes will be cut off for months without food and documents, with 12 to 14 hours a week.
We receive a complaint from our migrants.
"Their family promises one, and they are lying, choosing a passport, not paying the promised payment," confirms the head of the work migration management of the Tadjikistan Tolib Shariff.
Don't worry, man!
However, while many citizens of the Media-Asiatic Republic are recognized that they do not only know the language of the country in which they are seeking but also write on their own.
Of course, it is not so much of their faults: a few tourists, anxieties, tads can even get such a primary education.
Because their family has nothing to eat even children, not to say that they should be clothing, clothing, and preserving them in school.
Adult to adults, these guys are sent to the first opportunity.
It is hard, if they are wrong with the knowledge of the language, they are recognized.
"You feel humiliated and incomplete."
True, the law on the language is noted by the rightsguardians at one point.
The test will be carried out only for migrants who have a statute.
But if the status is not, there will be no tests or the following official work.
Among them, most of the guestbayers still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or External Income Respected"
Many of the arrival claim that we have an official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is for birocratic suggestions and even the same language difficulties.
Furthermore, the analysis costs money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
And this is a false record that can be made quickly, and all about half thousands.
Russian police partners know that we have in the main false documents, no registration, from here and cases of demand.
"The crossing hundreds, two on cigarettes, the tea," divided the journalists of Tadjikistan Umed Hoschadams.
"Noletty, don't worry, buy a livestock."
On the first day of entry into force of the Language Law, it was found that false documents were not only migrant registration.
A number of "lip" certificates for language tests have already been issued by the MSR.
The paper is printed on the normal color printer.
Of course, they received new owners of no gift: each of the migrants, hoped to facilitate the task of testing, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two times more than the official testing procedure: it will be involved in the work migrant in three thousand.
It is that the main task for the next time is to protect the system from corruption so that the "corps" is simply buying, consisting of the representatives of the authorities, as well as the right-guardians.
Until the authorities can promise guests that the tests have been successful for the first time, the time to study a basic language course.
Furthermore, unknown Russian coming will work in the fields that do not provide active communication with people.
MVD is not a illegal weapons market
A lot of crimes with the use of employment weapons is very small
Russia's VAT is to take the law on civil weapons owners.
This is the reaction of the authorities on recent incidents: to shoot shoes on marriages when there was no victims, and the fight, built by the Moscow Justice Dimitrium Winograd, which resulted in the death of seven people.
The police want to prohibit the transport of grass in public places and to increase the age of weapons licence from 18 to 21 years.
The idea supported the Chapter of the Security and Opposition Committee of Irin Jarova's corruption and promised that the amendments to the weapons law would be introduced in the House in the short future.
It is not enough that Russian authorities are trying to cope with the problem with the "cause of gases".
There was an open letter on the network that the authors of different public shooting organizations need to be rejected from "insensitive adversity".
Percentage of humidity with registered weapons is minimal, stated the Russian Service Bi-by-si criminalist Basilius Lesnik.
According to MVD statistics, in the year six months, 142 crimes were concluded with the use of fire weapons registered in internal matters, while at all 1168 thousand crimes were fixed for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the existence of the law in civil weapons does not place the criminal to go to the " black" market.
Now, according to their words, any weapons can be found in Moscow.
At the same time, MVD claims that they control the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Providers: from transfers to officers
The "Black" weapons market is filled with several channels.
The basic five of these channels, the Colonel of Victor Baragne, who was 10 years in the Ministry of Education and Henstabe, reports.
The site's record that takes orders on the weapons
The first is "armical or military track", which means the weapons that were stolen during the fighting in Kawake.
"The weapons were shot and the Russian officers, and the cabacs themselves," says Baranek.
The next type of " black weapons" is stolen by criminals in power structure representatives.
The Baracan explains that the police officers are also involved in here, and that they are furnished directly by the right-guarding bodies.
The "shops" are going to sell from military stocks.
Many military stocks often occurred in explosions.
"There are evidenced versions that part of the fuel has been made specially - to hide the failure," said the former military.
According to the statement of Baranz, the weapons produce.
"Now, private weapons are produced that do not maintain competition on the international market and put the weapons out of the black market, including Moscow," explains the expert.
Another source of black market is contraband.
In particular, there are weapons and automates from poor countries, such as Kirgisistan.
"There's its production, sometimes a cust, and a mafia that organized the stream," explains the former military.
Where's the weapon?
Experts considered the closer part of each of the sources of illegal weapons on the " Black" market.
The report was prepared in 2011 for the Probable Analysis Centre and State-administration designation.
Specialists analysis the report of MVD and Rosta, the criminal literature and the open ports on the weapons.
The long-term part of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and the forces.
The half of all weapons on the black market are " on the wine of the officers whose work is with the weapons," says the report.
According to the researchers, 17 per cent of weapons occur from armed conflicts, 14 per cent of the cases have been broken by weapon production, 5 per cent are "swarm geology".
A soldier-consultant of one of the armed magazines who requests not to call his family assured that the weapons found by black captains are too old.
As he says, the seller's new party goes to a military station.
See the prosecutor buys a unit, such as the TT gun.
It's written to him before it's been put through a boxer.
"He's going to carry it into town and sell it up to 900 for a thing with two magazines," he says.
"Really, the police in the course of all cases, so periodically when it burns a plan for the disclosure of crimes, it makes control purchases for non-legal weapons tradeers," adds the adviser.
"What's in the royal magazine?"
The seller and purchases are most often found one another through known people.
I watched the sites, in the blogs, until the companion who proposed to come to the form of God, where there will be a person who will bring me into the "cool" where we will trade.
The price of the stone I just learned there.
military obsession Family Victor Baranek
In order to get the ship, I need a acquaintance with the output, the seller-consultator tells me, I have such a known, but I'm not sure of it.
Sellers on the markets are, but there must also come, in terms of, "of Ivan Ivanovich, who requested that the daughter of the dent falls."
I'm even getting a few cassettes through a man who's sure.
He also puts them on me, because he knows I'm not going to give him.
News are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baragne tried in the middle of the 1990s to buyer of illegal weapons when he prepared the article on this.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
He gave him a album with graphics, where it was "all right."
"I felt like in a rash magazine," mentioned the military.
The purchaser, according to Baranz, doesn't have a cat in the middle -- everything can be tried.
I, the potential client, not just buy-- we're going with a seller in the forest, we're putting a muscle there.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm sure weapon is good, we're starting to trade," described the expert's procedure.
Dealing magazine
Searches on the Internet result on sites and groups in the "Contact" where they are to buy the "for different purposes".
No documents and different meetings are required for this.
"Adequately to have a certain amount of money," writes in the reklame chapter on the "Buy a gun or automat."
The users remain in their applications and questions.
What about the non-complete sales?
"No license, of course," asked the user "Ivan" (wrached).
"TTT. Moskva" is lacoonically formulating the request for "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now broadcast a huge network of basic sites and wanting to buy a fighting weapons is buried by lopats.

I heard about these schemes: Normally the website is registered by the Rusian laws.
People take orders.
Building through the bankomate produces payments.
"In response they send the graph and the section where the weapons are hidden," reports the press secretary of the public organization "The right to weapons" Dmitrius Kislov.
Viktor Barannik states that by leaving a request on the website, you can stay without weapons and fall on the delay.
The Federal Security Service has now broadcast a huge network of basic sites and wanting to buy a fighting weapons is buried by lopats.
"The people are going like a cold fish on the feed, and then they cover in Siberia's angle," he says.
Macro for $100
When buying illegal arrow weapons, as a result of expert evaluations, it can be added to $100 to $900.
According to Dmitria Kislova from the "Wapter Right" organization, the Makarov gun can be won for $100.300.
Waiting for a month of pole.
It is rejected from the long-standing components by the management of these medium-sized components.
According to the official knowledge statistics, compared to January-October 2011, the number of crimes in total in Russia was reduced to 7% and was 22.9.000, and the number of facts discovered for the destruction and ability of weapons, the exhaustive instruments and explosive devices were reduced to 7.8%.

Property of McDonalds is going to the fourth of all American growths
In the last days of the America's protests have been decreased against low loans in the Walmart University Corporations and the Population Networks, such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Until no one is going to predict whether this wall will be converted into the ninth wall or that it will be determined to smoke at the early stages.
Actions support promotions and a number of left public organizations.
Furthermore, the increase in short payments receiving a series of Walmart and the quick food systems, the aim of protest facilities is to create professional organizations in them.
Until this economy sector is almost upbuilding by a professional movement.
46 cents per year?
Actions started last week, after the Day of Thanksgiving, in the " Black Friday" that was called, when the orgy of raw sales was distorted in America, which took millions of people and sometimes covered by the bathrooms.
This day, some Walmart corporates, in which 2,2 million people work throughout the world, left their workplaces and pickets together with the professionals and the left operators of the corporation facilities, whose goods are deemed to be deemed to people of a modesty and medium.
Walmart trades everyone in the world, from the wheel, about the rays and the car battery to the leases, eggs and milk.
Products in his stores were averagely 8% to 27% of the additive than in major surmarkets.
Therefore, many lower payable Walmart employees are only on their own.
The accessibility and absorption of goods made Walmart one of the major corporations of America.
According to the critics, Walmart can allow it to sell the goods of a department because it's little to its owners.
The latter is also complained with difficult conditions of work, such as the lack of autoloaders or manual scanners.
Participants of the " Black Friday" were required to increase the payment and to make sure that the value of the medical insurance provided by the corporation was from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart, who receives $9.5 per hour, this cost is not on the karman, they said.
Scientists from the Californian University in Berklia demonstrate that if Walmart increases the average payment to $12 per hour, it will increase the corporation of $3,2 billion.
It's about 1,1 per cent more than it's going to pay the payment now.
If Walmart has completely transferred the increase of the payment on the purchases, each visit to the store will have only 46 cents.
They'll take over $12.39 for a year than now.
Walmart Parties have adequately noted that the protests were only in nine states and did not have a smaller damage.
The Black Friday continued in her stores from 8 hours of dinner on Thursday to midnight, and Walmart sold about 5000 goods per second.
In general, its cassual equipment produced nearly 100 million transactions in the Black Friday.
The representative of the corporation of Dan Fogelman, in the interview of the left site of Huffington Post, confirmed that the workshops left in general "minus five" of Walmart, and that the protesting action was totally a "commercial piarrhood" of its profession.
"Free Cass!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Walmart University (in this progressive town, therefore they are not yet here), and the McDonalds and other resource restaurants.
Donalds says he sells a billion of portions, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't make you honest!
Jumeine Williams, a member of New York's horseman
At this time, the minimum payment, which is the federal and New York Law, consists of $7,25 per hour.
The Restaurants of Quick Food with time increased, but disappointed, and in the middle of their range officers received $8,90 per hour in New York.
Less of them in this road town is no one who works.
How you can acquire such money in New York, it's inappropriate for me.
Sometimes through the McDonalds, there were almost four American growths that worked after their schools, living with parents.
A few people have seen the main source of employment or plan to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm keeping on interviewing with McDonalds, who's lamenting that they should live on this payment and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, the comments that the author notes is unresponsibility to carry children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Participants of protests, starting at 6.30 on Thursday at McDonalds on the 40th Street and Medison Aven, requested that the cashers and swimming the rapid food system start at least 15 dollars per hour, which is more than doubled their current minimum for the hour.
They also needed to create professional organizations in the field of quick food.
The American Law prohibits the administration to prevent and deduct the activists of professional movement by reliefs and freedoms.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But to cover rapid food is difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main frames is an increasing flow.
Non-equivalents
The swimming protests were at this day and in many other ship restaurants of Manhattan.
The climate of the action appeared in the middle of the Middle Day at McDonalds, near Times Square, on which several democratic policies were expressed, in particular, a member of Jumeine Williams, who said, "Makdonalds" says he sells a billion of portions, and then he does not even give you hospitals and will not allow you to be honest!"
The Democrats also supported other visible New York democrats, such as the candidate to the officer of Bill De Blascio, who said "We should be closely supported by the new Yorkians in order to gain the right payment and economic welfare of every New York."
As the new York Times had been warranted, this was the most important action in the history of the American area of fast food.
But only a few hundred people were involved, but not all of them were a quick company in which tens of thousands were taken in New York.
Until it's not clear whether this glass of the mass motion's flame will be born.
"When the brain is lying in the middle"
The population among modern technology worshippers has recently been adopted in particular by providing special points.
Slave for a year at its annual conference, the Google model, and then in November, the request for the corresponding patent of Microsoft was reported.
However, from a group of interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft Sharam Izady Laboratory of the Interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft Sharam Isady, it should be a stage for the scientists of this body.
Their maintenance is the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with heavy hands, the creation of virtual open spaces.
- Please tell me, in general, what's your research group doing?
- We are engaged in a man's interaction with cars, but we are trying to displace the borders of this interaction.
As long as the mass was able to work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes the tissues in their fingerprints.
We want to look forward to 5 to 10 years and predict the changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox plugin and Sensors Kinect is a step forward, and nearly no Xbox today is selling without Kinect, because all interestingly cruel management.
- What else are we going on?
- Despite Kinect's interaction at a physical level, many of these pounds happen on a flat screen, sometimes 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the outcome is not yet very much.
We are trying to change this, working on the real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
We need to leave the computer world in our physical, to make it more accommodated.
For this, however, we need to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add real world to virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place, this stupid reality shields!
- What do you think about the vote management?
It's a popular thing, but do they not revalue it?
- It is definitely called a panace - it is a question of privacy, because it does not always want to communicate to the citizens about their actions and actions.
Actually, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone is in his neck.
For example, we had a project for the management of the devices in public places, which we thought about the wheat, but not on the whistlers, but on such short, shortly.
The gesture was recorded not by the camera of the device, but by the manual braslet that fixed the mouse and the mouse movement.
Until he's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of handhours.
But it's the future for a mixed type of management, such as the gestus and the voice.
- That's how?
- For example, how would you ask me to send you this gaseo bank?
You'll say and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapted to what the car can or can't at this point?
- It's not necessarily, but it's a closer.
I think that in the nearest time, we should mainly work on the new types of sensors that allow to determine human reactions more accurately.
These may, for example, be laser sensors, give a bad depth permit, it is very important.
- If you're talking about your Xbox Kinect sensors, what's your claims to the modern cameras?
Don't you have permissions, depths, or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what we can delay in our three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 with a speed of 1000 k/s.
But the case is not in the megapixels, but as matrice and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us -- that adds work to the designers of algorithms.
So we need to remember not only the X and Y allowance, but also Z.
It's also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are sufficiently dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are evidently small, especially for violence.
Steven Bethishes from our Redmond Laboratorium made a sensor of cashany with regular delay - from 1 to 100 ms, and modern series sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
They don't all understand how much this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I'd like to have the equivalent of this device in my Property, but not the need for cashans, so that the frames for a second would be greater.
- And how many cameras do you need to increase?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually the infrastructure, and the second is the recipient of a depressed signal.
And this is the third camera, it's, in fact, a normal sensor of the visible area.
It does not apply to the depth of the object.
The potentially greater number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or lose it by increaseing the required amount of accounts.
It would be nice to create a kinect-like analog, to play with a raising position of cameras and to see how this will help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- As I remember, Microsoft, contrary to Google, she didn't present her eyes.
You don't know that, from the view of the everyday use of the technology of the additional reality, it's one of the most perceptive forms?
- Of course, all the time to break, holding the smartphone in his hands, it's not very convenient, but this is what I think: the most nice option would be the "pass" complemental reality when you could turn from the smartphone points, the projection screen and everywhere.
Pockets are a very personal device, in which their strength (private things you see only) and at the same time the additional reality will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with others.
- Imagine a minute that the manipulation of virtual golographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from the Yellow Man, but also to the simple.
There is a problem that often indicates the criticism of such ideas: there is no tactical response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group prepare for this call?
- In my lessons, I often say that the additional reality is the seventh account of breaking in the interaction of humans and cars.
I think eight can be a tactic feeling.
Until one of the interesting trucks is the use of the second hand as an imaginary piece.
She's a great record of pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually addressed to this "air cartridge" - for example, the interference of a number of ultraschool lines in a certain point where the pool is, gives a feeling, but until it's very easy - as if you've got to the rocks.
There are also breast-feeding breast-feeds that affect nervous reactions in the fingerprints.
- Did you try to lying the brain?
To make him think he feels like he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we're not trying to do that yet.
There is another task on which it is to be able to fight for a long time - as to put a man in a very strict space - to believe that he and Others are openly unfinished and that they work on the concepts of running rates (including in clubs), moved by forms, and great layers.
Until the brain is lied in the middle, the work is still very much for many years.
This is what it makes over virtual reality such an attachment to the researcher - many things in absolute initial state.
Cousin instead of culture: Rosbalt.ru
The "Rosbalt" continues the "Peterburg Avangard" project, dedicated to the citizens in front of culture and experience.
In this list, the light workers of Petersburg's arthritis, whose achievements are outside the city, often recognizing that it is, in the past of the universal ability.
The new hero of Rosbalt is an epocalyptic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a man who was clothed in all the red thing that was found in the Russian Museum, which is in the Latney Garden, and on the modest tubes and squares.
The Cards of Kirill Miller are always gathering too many lookers where they wouldn't be.
Kirill Miller is one of the suicide of the Petterburgan philosophers, creators of new mitologists.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of Peterburg's adventure at the end of the 1980s, the beginning of the 90s.
Moreover, he is a man of the city, a man of his appearance, who calls a laughing to a horrible man who lifts up all the treasure.
Recently, he took in his hands a sharman and a peterburgian charmant, since he made a role for this complex role by all his employment, philosophy and immigration.
- Kirill, why are you still going through the town in all the red, not in yellow or birrow, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a modeler who's looking at the kind and the image.
The red color in this world is a compromise between artists, immigrators and society.
Although everything that almost is not severe in the community is appealing and excitating the property.
But my provocations are intended to begin.
All the history of my provocation actions is a invitation to the debate.
- When did you realize that you should be a artist?
- To the DK Nevsk, where my work was exposed.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wheel of old free neo of artificials passed, and the new, free types of me were unintelligible.
I'm going to go with the artists of the new wheel, with the postgason, which brought to "Puskin-10", and there was no more wave.
He's put me into theatre, clothes, and all the genres, except words.
And all this was united in your art-clinic... I was important to look at the center of the culture of Peterburg, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took the territory at Pushinska-10, and there until there was a reparation, I had a `artist club, a `embuilding club, a house of Peterburg's godgema.
Many were born there: NAMEs, Tequila-Jazz, I remember how Snura brought up with the "Ucho Van Goga" project.
Snur and his friends sang under the fanery songs, they were in a treacherous trick, among them was now a modern composer of Igor Vdovin.
When the group played alive, she became Linegrad.
Trahtenberg was a leader of many programmes to the Hali-Galive Times.
We gave them Trahtenberg, and his great career, and the basic education and education he received us.
The "D 137", the "Griboeds" club, is an Arthlinic Clinic.
There's our architects and always gone.
I'm a hero of the yesterday century when the culture was meaning something.
In 2000, the question was in the press, the premium was "The people of our city."
I was called in the "Agenda Guidance" nomination, and my culmination ended.
In the new times of old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and population are divided, but can be popular, but not very cultural.
- I'm working with a famous way.
- Many of my pictures are a hit, they have a very nice accuracy and anxiety.
I'll have a program, "Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are an internal category.
I've been before, now to be like this is painful and painful.
But in the clowns, it's all disgusting, and the tragic is filmed.
I like a greetish, I have a Greek idea.
For example, the salvation of the world through the total recycling in order of debt.
Now on the clothes of meetings, orienting on external mechanism, not on the internal person.
Oh, maybe he's got his hand and he's needed to go into the rose.
And the disappointment will be discovered by the recycling.
And recently we saw you in the role of a town-sharman.
Who I don't have to be.
- Well, maybe a commercial experience can be beautiful?
- The commercial experience must now be accurate, taktic, sweet.
And the design of cultures.
Earlier, people fell in the room, one loved, just one.
Now they're all disrupted on the microcommunities, and now it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a stomach paper to like everyone.
Now you need to think who you'll like.
Now each colt heroe has 100 worshippers.
- And Stass Michael's coming for a few thousand!
- It's a brochure, there's a sex-social area.
And 300 people will not come on the cultural ground, and 10 thousand will not come, and at the end, less of the manager, money, everything is cooked.
I've got some worshippers, the main thing is not to be lying, not to get out of the nausea.
I wrote the pictures that one collector had them on the wall near Falk and Laryon.
I started with the picture they usually end.
Now they are often getting understanding.
They say, spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There are no consumption cultures, it's from another operation.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, growing in examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused of money for drawing a picture.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Peterburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a understanding: a cultural factor.
But not everyone of them can handle culture.
The kings may not understand very much in the culture, but they realized that they needed to maintain the right experts.
There are good consultations in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they are deceived, because they need higher experts who will correctly perform these experts and give them a way.
Now the cousin's blowing.
The same is Erart, but they distinguish that they honestly say that we are not all the modern experiences, there are artists who have to search for other museums.
- What's for you, Peterburg?
- Peterburg is not a hundred cultures, in Moscow culture much more, there's a land.
And on our stones, experience grows hard.
We need cultural land, and now we have writers more than readers, it's wrong.
There are many interesting people who go on exhibitions, concerts.
We've got this tone layer.
We need to make a modern experience as it was at the beginning of the past century.
Project for Grant-Peterburg
Birth in Space
The earth is in danger.
Global heat or confusion with asteroid murder.
Covered space vessels with landscapes on board are sent to search for a backing planet.
Does the main question arise to continue its nature in conditions of invisibleness or on the same reserve plane?
I think a little choice is.
Actually, only two actual planets that can be at least hypothetic.
"This is Venera and Mars," says the older scientist of the State Astronomy Institute P.K. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions are more convenient for life on Mars, the temperature is 500 degrees at the surface of Venerus.
Life can only be at a big height or at the Vener's orbit... in the space.
The approach to the reproduction in the space was started by the floor.
A half of the years ago, experiments were conducted.
The four generations of the mountains on the orbit were not different from their earthquake.
Then it is the outcome of the orbits of small fruitful muchdrozophils.
In 1979, eggs were sent to the space to check the development of the Brion in the conditions of invisibleness.
We're getting a totally normal bird on the outcome.
And here's the problem beginning.
"The problem that this bird has to find opposition must stand up on his legs and start moving," explains the Laboratory of the Medical and Biological Problems Institute, RAN Vladimir Sychev.
Without finding the opposite, the birds were worthlessly covered.
And after 10 hours, the newborn was a full atrophy of instincts.
The birds don't respond to the world and the sound.
And the trouble was that they just died in four weeks.
"And twice we smoked the birds, then we refused, because it is not simply working with them," states the experiment with the birds in the Vladimir Sychev space.
With animals, the last time the biological "minician" was flying to the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in 2013.
However, the Bion's bioshop will only be one-fold person.
There was an experiment with cruses that had been sent to the space with fruit.
In principle, there was nothing overnatural.
"It was just on biostraighters, but again, it's a single experiment, and such research must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing in space cross, the seed appeared.
But to reach the problem of multiplying directly in the space until it gets.
It's not easy.
Life, losing, normal living environment, can't simply make their sex instinct.
But a man, in contrast to the beasts, in principle, may.
Homo ́ens has a abstract thought and is able to create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not conducted in ethical views.
But women in the space are 50 years old.
The biggest risk was in Teresco.
And the most precious thing that is in the universe is a woman's body.
Our Chuck's flight, and no one on Earth could say if he would keep it in the space after the flight.
Whether she should be born a child after this flight.
"Behold, no one answered this question," says the veteran of raketo-cosm, "Wahtang Vacade has grown up.
In June 1964, only a year after it was flying into the space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valenno Tereskov was born a daughter.
The father of the child Andrew Nicolaev was also a cosmonau.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut Sweetlan Savic, who was two times in the orbit and even in the open space, was born a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have a little, the units are counted on cosmonaves who have all spent after long flights, and it is a healthy generation.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," it submits the result of the aerodrome cosmonaut, the Heroy of the Council Union, the Heroi of Russian Valerie Polak.
However, it is necessary to seek some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creation of experienced gravity.
The CPC hydrolaborator is a necessary stage of preparation for the aircraft.
Here, in the conditions of nul flow, the cosmonavians are working scientists in the open space.
Water is imiting unconsciousness.
If for adults water, push, and comfortable, but even strange environment, for breast children is a natural nature.
Small yotiands like confirm that life has been out of the ocean.
There's a relationship between the little boy's about nine months in the cockpit, and he's more habitual to the water.
In principle, it's logical because since the birth of the first buying is only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says Marina Axenna's breast-feeder.
As a word, if a child born is more natural than a person, the woman is gravity, the force of weight.
Very quickly, the mouse of life is too fast, and the taza is able to produce fruit.
All right, let's leave it, trusting the staff's stimulators.
Of course, in a special camera, she's gonna take it out.
"What else?" means the neutrality of the issues of Valeri Polak.
On the other hand, the child also needs experienced gravity.
Without a sense of earthly attempt, organism does not form a squelet and muscle system.
It is not like a adult to cloth in a special train costume for training.
He will just be deceived of what he will need to live.
"And this experiment that we will go with you, allowing the child to be born in the foreign environment, will lead to that we will bring an invalidity to the Earth of a completely disappointed human," predicts the ruling of the IMBP RAN Igory Pestav Bioetics Committee.
By the birth of children in the space, the question of the theory.
However, after time, it will be reality when the landscape on their ships will be moved to a plane that will become a house for their descendants who are born in the space.
Chief of the Main Control-Revision Management: The control of the system has fallen on political wine.
Czech Republical purchases are available by good control bodies and, despite the quality of the law, it remains in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the control and audit management, from an interview for the site Currently.cz.
"The Law will never be ideal, but it must apply correctly what I think we do not have," is the comment of Kala's current situation.
The appropriate conclusions provide joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of a wrong problem, Peter's approach to the so-called swarz-system.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Gredan Democratic Party) would not be afraid of the inspectors - is it prohibited or permitted?
"The Law should be established anyway, and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the institutions that are able to check and comply with the commitments," Cala states.
At the meeting of the Revision Committee in the Deputate Palace, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and the German parties in which the law on the public purchases of both countries was established.
What was the matter specifically about?
There's a parallel check that we've started, probably two years ago.
Moreover, to say that the Peace Law confirms how public purchases should be carried out, the national legislation should be more appropriate and then the application of the public acquisition.
All information was collected and, even in an infinite check, have been found interesting differences - simply, the law may be "adequate and unfailable" but in some parameters, we adhere to Germany.
It is necessary to focus on the application of the law that is not sufficient to create more and more precise rules.
And how can this project help you what it means for you?
Such joint control can contribute to efforts to determine, reduction and completion of laws, because it does not result in a positive result.
Economy means receiving the relevant (but not always low) price in order to avoid riches and perhaps crime behavior.
But not the fact that we do this, reducing orders.
This system may be filled with "bumagays" so that those who want to find the laze in this system will find them far more than if it would not be reduced.
You are talking about internal issues of application of the State acquisition law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Does there be such a way as our CIA (Contrôle-Revisional Management) or does that work differently?
As a result of the institutions, there is Bundesshof, which is established by our principle, also a college that works a little differently, but mainly both institutions are working similarly.
Furthermore, the powers to a certain degree are like, but since Germany has a federal structure, there is a share of the audio and at the level of federal lands - there's a variety of different systems from ours.
BRH can only be managed by federal money, we are available by public funds.
Common funds in our regions and munities are controlled at the level of federal accounting palats.
What is the case of the Law of the Law, there is easier than we have?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some cases, Germany can be taken as a model, but it is certain that it is better in everything.
That's because they're better controlled?
No, but I repeat, I don't like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even model countries are faced with many problems.
In the contrary, they wouldn't receive any benefit from cooperation with our office, right?
If you talk about the internal law, how have you reflected your institution's amendment to the State acquisition Act, how are the consequences?
Since the legal force of these amendments is sufficiently short, it has not yet been shown in our work of control.
Since we are controlling the fact, we need to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we started using our new "detecting the risk of non-economicity" instrument, through which we have lost almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them, and, of course, these changes will be shown, because changes are changed, and the conditions of some types of tenderers and so far.
How do you think that this law will benefit or additional charges to the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law, of course, is a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will be confirmed.
The problem that may occur is that the rules are "injured" and will not be able to observe them.
In the operation of previous rules, controlled undertakings are related to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the State acquisition law means a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Does the law in such a way be applied?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to arrest and misuse, but not those who make a formal error that does not affect the decision.
This system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this way will not bring anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP would not be concerned with the controllers of the so-called Svart System.
"Swartz system" prohibited or allowed?
The Law should be identified in any way and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the bodies to which it is intended to verify and comply with the commitments.
"We can change this law and let it be," but say that we will be deceived if nothing happens.
The State acquisition law contains sufficiently strong rules as and what should be conducted formally, and it is right, which will protect public purchases.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best proposal is discovalificed only because of the deficiency.
The Law will never be ideal, but it must apply correctly what I think we do not have.
The roads are rocky, but mainly passed.
In some places, the Czech roads are disturbed and disturbed.
They are mainly passed, but somewhere more carefully.

Simon Ornest: On concerts we want to bury energy
What do you think that the end of the light should be made less than a month?
It's just one of the many anxious news on which we, people, are so easy to fall.
Instead, the Tap Tap group is continually awake on this subject and we say that we are the only group in the world that will be able to collect sufficient energy to deteriorate or prevent the end of the light.
Moreover, in December, you're going to give a absolute unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you like to tell the readers about this more detailed?
It is also about the national collection of funds we have planned for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the calendar of May, the end of which was declared on 21 December at 11:10.
On the day before this event, on 20 December, at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Easter are parallelly launched.
They're finished, and they're increasingly saying, at the time on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is a timezone for 12 hours ago before us, the magic calendar will be completed.
Who did this idea come to?
I mean, it was my idea that we all had been thinking together with our artist of Gonza August.
Besides that we want to bury enough energy and prevent the end of the light, we also want to think about the condition of this world once to be delivered to our people.
In the event of the Mah calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from rubber, football, sockets and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased on www.e-tap.cz and the same way to support us.
The Tap Tap Group, together with other agents, also fulfilled the shim against the end of the light, which is called "The End of Light is canceled".
Does YouTube's already loved listeners have gone on these profitable concerts?
Of course, at the end, if everything is accomplished and the end of the world will not end.
All artists will have it on all concerts at the same time.
Similarly, in the Czech TV directly sounds.
The words to this song wrote and played Jesus ’ role in the Tomash Hanak film, learning to perform Xindl X...
How did you work with them?
We also cooperate with others in the Czech Cultural Life as we conduct many good works and concerts.
We are trying to connect them actively to these projects.
It seemed that many like to work with us, they were interested.
What do you eat from the concert against the end of the light?
In order to buy equipment for the STUDEO Free Education Centre, we have been working so for the sixth year with the civil Tap unit in the Edlic Institute.
Teachers regularly visit students the Edrick Institute School and conduct pleasant and interesting activities with them.
The students have no means to go to teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
In the context of the draft additional building of the Edelki Institute in the future, it will come from which we will go with this project.
There will be several groups and artists on each concert.
What were the criteria of the selection?
We tried to create a programme that involves all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marijan Bango and Irgi Suhi.
Both details can be found on www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "ground business" in the future?
We're going to be first on the "Prace Weather" Festival and we'll, of course, prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the last year, we would be pleased to present a presentation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, I would like to speak very much in Washington and Chicago.
With regard to the border you have serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with opportunities.
How are you doing with the way of organising and logistics?
It's not just as it's in the first view.
We have five participants on electrical invasive bottles, their boys have to travel in the river, plus all the large number of weight and boxes with tools.
However, while the Czech Airways and the British Airways have always been overwhelmed for us that I am so many times awaiting.
Even in Moscow, where we've recently returned, everything went out without problems.
Thanks to the round, you can compare different countries from the view of access, publicity to persons and so far.
What did you do to this moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we have, we became witnesses in Russia that are still at the east level.
In comparison with Prague in Moscow, many bariers are still in the dikhovine, and there is still a single human movement to the electricity of the invalid coast in the centre of the city.
It is not the way that the ban is going to take the way of an invalidity in the lift.
Happy, and there are already public organizations who are trying to focus people on the problems of people with opportunities.
And what, in contrast, should we continue to achieve the preliminary countries?
There's a lot of things, a level of fulfillment that's far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those who have this rate.
In London and Madrid, it's normal that people with a hard form of inquality can be moved to a toilet, a museum, wherever...
There is not very expansion that a large number of people who are able to participate actively in the public life, we and The Tap Tap are looking at them!
Respect of publicity or security is one thing, but at the time we have a sportsman, artists, actors, politics or judges, everything will really begin to change.
Until this is a unique case, people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but will we return two years ago that in 1998 you'd be organized for it?
I went to the Edlic Institute as a teacher, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm playing myself, including saxon, I've organized a interesting circle together with my colleague.
Well, with time, as our leader Lady Angelovich says, this was a little out of control (laughs).
But the Pope came only in the last years, or I'm going something?
This is true, we have been helping us to join the named songs and to work actively on the promotion of the group.
We have concluded that the work that no one can evaluate is as if it does not exist.
With the means of the Union, we can allow qualified teachers, equipment and so far.
Did the goal be to make the Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in ability to do something inevitable.
In Shaw-Bise, it's a whole thing that imitates one another.
It's logical, it's all new to be taken carefully, and it's a long time.
There's a very little rare thing, but I'm sorry to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, trial, is naturally...
But this complaint is completely exhausted, because I do not have any painful and dismissed persons that we have to complain.
They are people who can live a full-valuable life and develop, of course, only when they are resources.
I'm saying, if people have something incapacity, it's not just a move for them but also for the whole society.
Has it been successful that you are a strict royal, which many believe you?
If we want to do qualitatively, we must be in many things free and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's all right.
People come to us with romantic representation and years in clouds, and when they realize that they have to go to recreation two times a week, to visit the courses and to take a lot of time in the road, they lose entusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and reach something.
The Tap Tap group is now twenty people.
How many were they at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We are a open group, people come and go, it is not to prevent.
For those who have the desire and the power of the will, our doors are always open.
It will be a day before the expected end of the light, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
Concert procured in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno, in the Fléda and Ostrave Club, in the Plynoim center, participating in the 12 groups and other Czech Republics.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are united by the telemount at the time of the playing of the group The Tap Tap " The End of Light is canceled."
The objective of this project is to collect 25 million crowns to buy multifunctional free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edelki Institute in Prague.
It is 400 crowns per concert, for children up to 12 years free. Bills can be purchased in Bohemiaticket earlier.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the Space of the Polish Agency, a twenty-second member of the Agency’s Space was adopted as the second country of the former East Block (after the Czech Republic, who became a complete member of the ECA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ECA in 1994 and took active participation in a number of Agency projects during the following years.
But the way to the Space of Poland has started a lot before.
Before World War II, the Polish Enthusiastes were traveling into the space, but it was not always understanding.
For example, on the Lection A. Sternfeld, which was represented on 6 December 1933 in the Barshaw Astronomy’s observatory of the idea from its innovative work "Introduction to Cosmonavic".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the equivalent auditorium, and after several years, Shernfeld reminded that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his own.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld wined Robert Estro-Peltri and Andreas Louis Hirsh for "Introduction into Cosmonatic".
Dr. Yan Hadomski (1899 - 1966), which was mentioned above, later represented by a large propaganda of astronomy and cosmonautic.
He explained hundreds of articles in the Polish magazines and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
The Haddomian World Progressor, and its contribution was evaluated in the case of one of the craters on the back side of the Moon was called for his honour.
In 1925, in Poland was built a race of race, based on racket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
Not even clearly, the racket should have been used for dilution or heating.
Including this vehicle is only from the pressure of that period.
Since 1933, the Polish Artillery began to consider rackets.
A study on the Infrastructure Technology Section in collaboration with Professors McChislav Wolfka and Gustav Moskvic.
Manufacturer of materials shows that studies have reached practical trials.
But with the arrival of German armies of work, they were interrupted.
In 1937, in a specialized print, the idea of the electricity of the destruction racket proposed by the Engineer Rogozinski, and in the year, the "Awake Torpeda and Aviation Racket-Bomba" was performed by the author Lelivy-Kivoblock.
Both projects were arranged for military use of racket engines.
Before the war, all drafts of military use of racket technology were taken by the Temporary Scientific Consultive Committee (Doradczo-Naukowy) which was coordinated with all.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years his work was completed because of the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work, dedicated cosmonavatic, appeared in the Polish press after war, thanks to the Polish Astronautic Society (Polski Astronautic Society).
The first of the public is mentioned in the November 1954 magazine of the Protocols, in which four volume articles on astronautics are listed.
In one of them, Professor Sobotovic proposed to organize a society that would be cosmonatic.
At that time, projects of experienced satellites were already carried out, and it was clear that space investigations were a per-educative growth.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (POA) has tried to enter into the international astronautical federal (based in 1951) and has already become its member.
In the year 1902-1959, the first Chairman of the OA Cazimež Zarankevicz was the Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He stayed at this position until his death, which was in 1959.
Since 1956, the UNO has contributed to the development of a completely successful RM meteorological racket (Raqueta Meteorologicna) which has become the first Polish rachete that has been conducted by scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was closed in 1957, and the first department was held on 10 October 1958.
The racket that was able to overcome the race of 1800 m was about 80 cm and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Finally, a consolidated version of RM-1A was built, and in 1959 there were experiences of a double-grade RM-2 racket.
The racket was about 1,4 m and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
The next version of the racket was already able to take place with the actual scientific -- the RM-34 racket could exceed 14,5 km and it was monitored by the high wind.
But in 1962 the further development was stopped.
The inheritance of the first RM rackets was meteor-1, divided between 1962 and 1965.
The racket was considered as a double-graduate, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (subscribed as Meteor-1A, -1V and -1S) were differed from the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
Meteor-1A was available with a range of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1S - 0.62l.
The sole distance of the flight at all three types was 37 km.
During the period between 1965 and 1968 in the Aviation Institute, the rackets of Meteor-2 passed, and its first annual experiences began in October 1970.
The meteor-2 racket with a start weight of 380 kg was able to produce a weight of 10 kg at a height of approximately 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also necessary to consider the introduction of Poland to the Co-AAR (Pasma Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of the Co-AAR National Committee for two years later.
Moreover, in the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in the research of the space of the Soviet research satellites, and in 1978 the Polish Pilot Miroslav Hermashevski second intercosmonau after Vladimir Remecca.
The abrogation of the law on public work is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annuled the law on public works.
The establishment has been awakened in the public.
Absolutely, it will be interested in looking at this problem with a broader point of view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalised world, are in line with the principle of non-regulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that economic departments, national economic systems, are in constant conflict.
This is with the principle of free trade and freedom, no private capital movement, together with an unexpected financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of the slaves of the force (for the debt), the price pressure occurs.
Under this sense, it must be understood when the manufacturer is trying to stand in economic competition through the supply of the goods, in order to increase the value of the competitor in order to take a large part of the market and thus increase its own income.
In the mass, this means that most enterprises or the transfer of the production to the rubber, or the rubber purchases, or the injury, in the countries where the valuation of the valuation of the forces, in comparison with others, is increased.
Since the private capital does not take any responsibility, including for the non-processed capital, the inevitable costs of the State for the needs.
In general, the Lady of Employment strengthens the disapproval of taxes and compensates the public economic and competitive damage of their income.
The situation is so good that specific statistical data should not be provided.
The unserial methods of the private capital establish the economy of certain States in the situation where the Governments of the countries have to enter into competition in order to experimentally reduce their population in order to enter into the country of foreign capital.
In other words, the Governments give their own population to the production of a private capital, despite the fall.
This reflects mainly in the changes of the Act of Property.
The objective is to make their people economically subject to private capital dictate, especially in the field of EEC.
This acts as a system of economic impairment in the case of long-term without a person, and at the same time it is a tool for the derogation of the rights of the employees in the field of work law.
As a result , the level of poverty is increased , and the difference between the poor and the rich .
A number of years in the FRC has been a public distribution of poor products that are not able to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of people are already approaching a million.
In the context of increased competitiveness, German economy continues to occur when employed people receive such a payment that the State should pay them to receive a minimum of livelihood.
The successful scandal is the public and in the case of additional Buddhists.
Economy measures often in all Southern EU states have been brought to the same status in which people under the pressure of a disaster of the status have to emigrate or emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to pay a ninthical payment in the areas of society in hope that sometimes in the country at the private investment capital.
But where will he take from?
If the capital in other EU countries, the poverty is moved from one country to another, or it is not at Other, since the Chinese, the Indus, the Brazilian, the Turkish, the Marokko, the Egyptian, the African still works for the part of the Property.
It's caught to the entire Latin America.
Liberal theory and mass-information means that the State cannot participate in the capital of the own hostship that the economy is managed to economic disaster.
The partial capital insists that the State should not be involved in the economic.
The question should be answered, doesn't the private capital act now practically governing politics and the most common State, for their own egoist purposes?
A single answer is yes.
The evidence is to be acquired of practically powerful and all-qualific lobbys in all States.
As a result, we have an unusual situation in corruption to ensure mutual benefits, to the law of the law, where it is practically all deserving punishment, but it is not a crime.
In the FGF, the State Ministers are in a situation that because of the lack of financial funds at the time of the legal projects of private legal undertakings which are physically involved in industry.
Then these legislative projects are approved by Bundstag.
The whole authority is not from the people as the constitution of the western type, but from the financial powerful groups who prefer their own interests.
Of course, the liberally oriented democracy is now quickly in the situation described by Appian in the production of the Roman Empire in the days of César and Pompeia: "The State has been disrupted for a long time, and the knowledge has been committed by violence.
Consumptions, illegal receipt of stones and rocks.
The victoriousness and corruption flowed without prohibitions, and the people went on elections with previously sold voice"""...communication people did not balance the position of the Governor, at the end, one State for eight months remained without consulation." . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Like in the past, in the present society, their own unconscious interests are not accountable for public interests.
The shared capital is no longer intended to apply for public purposes.
The current result is not different from the past: the inevitable accident of the elite without any effort to reform more deeply.
So the cause of fascist and communistic regimes is to be searched for insensitive liberalisation of economic systems for 19 and 20 centuries.
The lack of these regimes and the democracy of the Liberal Type can be considered as a certain pause after which the tourists are expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and human disasters, which we already observe, as we know from the old and new history.
The abrogation of the law on public work is not a decision or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition as well as at international and national levels and at Peace, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways for further decreasing the population level.
Thus, this trend has a systemic character.
With the decision, I have the objectives of political and Implementing reforms to strengthen the depth participation of the State in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the Government of the State and weak the monopolary situation of the private capital in the public for the benefit of the State.
Israel: The Haos Laboratory.
"From violence, and can never go out" - Steng, the song "Groupies", where the main verse refers to me, "We don't forget what we're crazy."
"If my sons wouldn't want wars, they wouldn't be" -- the dead Gutel Snaper, Mary's wife, Amshel Rotsheld.
Following the violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, it was called to respond.
One expression for Israel, arguing his position by the right to self-defence, and the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arranging this by the racism of Israel's State, genocide consisting of Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is a role of terrorism.
I don't want to think of who in these periodically repeat the murders is a criminal and who, finally, the victim of Israel's citizens, including self-governmental territory, were born in the present political situation and were not witnesses to the beginning of violence.
My goal is to propose the readers to look forward to the inquiry, to see who are first-timely pressured for 95 years (that is from the signature of the Balfur Declaration in November 1917) to the small part of the country of the Middle East.
My discussions are supported by historical facts, some of them have been made on my own understanding of who or who a group of people is the main engine of the events of modern history.
The history of the universe is primarily the history of the fight against authority.
Every time we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
That is not so clear - whether these people have always taken their steps completely, or somebody who has sent their actions on their throne to the previous purposes.
It should be permitted that we live during the period when the world's riches are completed in the hands of several persons, and that the contention of money and the power of them could not occur for a generation's life.
One of the astronomically rich families is designed that could be considered as a snare (I don't know if someone is worth them, but it is not excluded) - Rotshelds.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Rathers) had already buyed in the 19th century to stop listening to their names with crimes in the highest areas in which they were found, which always lead to strengthening their authority, providing riches or simultaneously, and to another.
They have major packages of nearly all the central banks of the world, and against countries in which central banks they do not have their shares, they lead or prepare a war (only seven countries were brought to Afghanistan, after the introduction to Iraq, 5 countries remained only four, but the Russian Government took the central bank of his country in their hands at the same time).
Everyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rotsheld Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to release his own (governmental) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to release his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (the Federal Reserve System) was killed in 1963.
Their desire for the world power has led to a plan of three world wars created by a large mass of the 33th level of Albert Picom.
The first war was the disruption of the Monaco States in the Property, the second should have been to make a deal of the public, especially the United Kingdom, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world population at approximately 0.5-1 billion people (as a number of slaves will be sufficient to ensure their comfort and resources, and they will not need a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing else but a precept for that project) and the absolute commitment.
The method in which the group of the richest families in the head of Rotshelds works is the call for the crisis and the next proposal of decisions (order ab chao series of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED, which had to prevent the re-repeat of the crisis in 1907).
Thus, after they had been able to join the First World War through the murder of the Habsburg inheritant of the Austrian Hungarian trone in Sarajevo, they held the Kingdom Russia, starting a major revolution.
The First World War ended unbased in the military and economic attitude of Germany's capital (not yet needed for the King-Russian Royal War) and, as a result, the destruction of the Central-Eve State, Austria.
To facilitate the interconnection of the Second World War, bankers and politicians have created a hidden conflict situation by putting great military reforms in Germany, which were the preference for radicalization of the daily mass, then there was only a strong, cruel and simple decision of the leader, to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that had to play, and it was actually playing the function of the fifth, in the burning of war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotchilda was provoked by the Sionist movement, one of which was attempted to create a Jewish State, willingly in the history of Judah with Jerusalem as his capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfur declaration created a preference for the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, which began the first conclusions with the Arab population.
The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War, difficult to evaluate whether Hitler was exhausted from the staff in which the bankiers were maintened, or everything he did, was planned, in any case the suffering of Jewish Jews in the contesting camps had made preferences to recognize the Jewish State by the worldwide community.
Israel was official in 1948 and, as Germany had been produced by military reforms for the Second World War, the State of Israel was invited to establish a third war.
If the banks are able to join it, the Jewish people, as well as in the Second World War, will become a victim of warfare on the front line, now with the Arabic or, easierly, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a gigantic laboratory, a source of disorder and chaos, not only within the country but also at international level (to take only a rare division of people in the strangers and opposers of Israel).
Who are guilty, and who are victims in the Palestinian Israeli conflict, where the calamity causes an obstacle to unfinished violence, if everything begins from the desire of individuals and their desire to the world power?
There is a need to distinguish Israel's ordinary people from their leaders, because as we have, the bankiers advise people to vote on elections exclusively their own candidates.
The present Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of the fascist, loyal bankiers in order to start war with Iran, which, thanks to the Iran member of the Shanghai Group of Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to cross into the world conflict and taking into account the control of Iran on the Ormusk oil containing 20% of all global oil stocks (the judge is only 2 miles width) - will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In which light now David Rockfeller said: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will take a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of lords and slaves.
The world where the rest of the population serves a worst financial aristocraty that enjoys comfort.
Peace, where every body born implants a chip with which it becomes a ≥ under total control.
"And he makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have a clay on the right hand or on the lamb, so that a person who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of his name could not buy nor sell.
This is what wisdom is: everyone who has Â can calculate the number of beasts.
For it corresponds to the name of the EEC, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
Film "Argo Operation": When worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, the multitude of islamists-demonstrated students arrested the United States staff in Teheran and took 52 diplomas.
They should have been released to exchange the sight of the Mohammed Reze Pechleve Shak, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who were the decades of his regime.
For the United States' administration, the positive result of the situation was not supposed that she could not allow herself to put a shock on the bar, because it could have been in the root to put confidence in the Union in other countries.
However, it was not able to achieve the freedom of debtors in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the theocratic regime.
It was a attack on the United States' income, which later was strengthened by an insufficient attempt to free the hosts by force.
The closed diplomats were released after 444 days after negotiations in the middle of the Government of Algeria.
Their judgment has been sentenced to the house of solidarity and anti-antyrian adjustments.
The damage in Iran was significantly encouraging Jimmy Carter to the presidential elections in 1980, completed the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, held by the actor Ben Afflecom "Argo Operation" described one of the episodes of the story that brought America a small winner.
Soon before the occupation of the company, six officials were able to escape.
After complex periods, they ended their way to residence in Canada.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, has been able to take them out of Iran, helping the extravagant covering entry they had passed on Canadian passports as members of the seed group seeking a place in the country for science-tax of epope.
Genre summary
The plan that had taken a "Evacuation expert" to Tony Mendes needed to cooperate with Hollywood.
In order to be reliable, specialized magazines were written about the project of the film , the press conference was established, and the manufacturer company had the real office.
Detailed operations have been held in secret, movie, on Tony Mendes' memories.
The Affleca film is a combination of several genres.
On one hand, the real political triller, such as "film-kinoos", the story of a successful tape, the areas - may be a number of films about Oushen's friends.
The film has continuously changed the constructions - from one side documentally behind the scenes from Teheran (the characteristics of historical events shown in the titris and how the same situation was demonstrated in the film - no large differences in it).
On the other hand, Hollywood rubbers are facilitated to cross the ironic and medium-screen.
And then another scene from the CIA apartment and other agencies -- men in coasts discuss the situation behind negotiations tables, at the staff of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afflecu has been able to make a career restaurant.
From the highlighted actor, the register, and its game has stopped to be an object of smile.
'Argo operation's third full-metered film, after the dark child's "Send, boy, forgive" (2007) and "Groad" triller (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film of Afllec, which is not recorded in the home town of the register, Boston.
The atmospheric atmospheric atmosphere will take place to qualitys that have increased the early recorder films above the Hollywood standard.
And Appleck shows it in the Argo, where Tegeran "play" Canadian.
The best scenes in the movie occur, in the river of the real events -- enter the scene of the fall of the community are impressed by their clearness, which also transmits the emotions of the potential and invisibleness that occur when the story is suddenly changed.
Appleck and his colleagues seemed to have reached in industrial scenes (the teacher based stab).
Too many processes in too many places.
The register had to be questioned that the report was not supposed to have a film-maker scene.
He works quite successfully with this little, sometimes something thinks - all this is not so elegant (screen in which the phone call in America prevents the emergency crisis in the Teheran airport, and the airport is looking quite awful.
The "Argo" lack is the disruption that is needed to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very proud, but their staff would deserve more space, and they were not only in the movie.
The Afflec film doesn't suffice for a little drama, it's a film that can be seen with a moderate interest, with a retro-style and a seventy-style triller.
But it's hard.
However, this is sufficient for a reminder of one, still in the meaning of life history, and to testify over the highlight of the presentations of the Almighty and All-known Services.
Rules for aircraft, bananas and circles
The portal of www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which is annually responsible for the most absurd banking collections, now decided to declare a concurrence on "a single absurd installation or project from the EU Master".
"We have contributed to this last event, in which the EU plans to take a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major Peace company," said the True Agency of Ombudsman Patrick Nager.
A recent decision of the Court of Justice to join the tax of insurance for men and women.
Before these couples, women had debt for life's assurance because they were objectively subject to me to less risks insurance.
"The next incredible ideas from the EU Master can move people to competition until the end of this year.
Only a vote will pass until the end of February 2013," Nager said.
For example, the EU's compliance is to add biocomponents to fuel, which results of nature and prohibit the use of reliable rubber grades only because they contain a very small number of dangerous materials, or a directive on the size of the cells for the cups, which has been able to carry out eggs in this year .
The criticism has also been a real prohibition of the use of the term "butterroad oil" or the exemption from the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimetres long.
The Community’s equipment often makes a decision under the pressure of that or other trade or industrial lobby, which normally protects positions in Brussels by any State or group of States (in this way, the Czech Republic is now in a threat of the needs of its banks).
Interests of lobbys such as: for example, the higher quality bananas should have reached the length of 14 cm and have not been able to show anonymous knowledge.
In this context, the Committee was justified by harmonising only the different national rules which have combined trade.
The EU, despite the opposite of some States, has still reduced the standards of fluid and fruit, with regard to the adoption of products.
The candidate may also be the EU's last year's establishment, which requires that the sales of aircraft be warned that children of less than eight years of age may not be able to delay them without monitoring adults.
The EU addressed the American studies with which the aircrafts in games are the potential cause of children's death through the dust.
It is now extended to children until 14 years of age, prohibited to go into the jail.
Divertising ideas are born as well as homes
The rule of the Peace's owners is sufficiently absurd: everyone who has an official position in the EU cannot, taking into account the delicateness of the issue for Greece and using the name of the Greece, but should instead say "BURM" (ex-Jugoslav Republic).
The Bankoupplaty.com Portal proposed to vote in collaboration with the Free Economy Unit of the Princep (Laissez Faire) of Liberal Economists (Laissez Faire), other than the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU rule on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established a maximum amount of food stocks that may be located in the Czech Republic's territory on the day of its income into the Czech Republic.
Consequently, the Czech Republic has increased, for example, the amounts of conserved gribes, which threatened her with a great strife.
The prosecutors also concerned the idea to provide some countries because they have no sea, and the idea of subsidy supplies to a claim to obtain subsidies.
But these ideas came in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We're in an inappropriate situation because we have no sea.
We will ask the Recompense Union," stated the Minister for Agriculture of Jaroslav Palas, on August 2004.
As a argument, he indicated that there was a high wheat of grain in the country and that the State had full stocks to be exported by such intervention purchases.
Because Czech is far away from the ports, the EU, the Palass, had to pay us hundreds of millions.
At the end of the meeting of the Czech Republic, the Commission organized tenders for the purchase of grain from countries that have no outcome to the sea.
The subsidies for the receipt of subsidies offered the Regional Development Ministry of the Ministry of Germany (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies should have been made to comply with the statements of subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Excellent displacements I have been excluded
Although the establishment in Member States is easily critical, the EU's efforts to regulate, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the Union, are deserving more recognition as many experts.
The serious problem, according to experts, is to draw up EU contributions on projects that do not even have a view of something common with the deep integration of Peace, but the Member States have reached in the debate of the budget.
It calls for emotions among the Czech and that, as in other countries, the Czech Republic must take place in Brussels for the right to a specific identity of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this composition.
Although after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, the name "Olomouckeys", but the "Thuzemian Room" traditions in our country were running roots in the 19th century, our producers had to be renamed to "Thuzema".
It can be called romantics only products from a throat distillate, not from a sugar sackle.
In the official list of EU-registered products, as well as the worldwide "feta" and "gorgonzola", marcypan from German Wolfeck or Parmish, there have already been, for example, carvovary sugars, burning and thirshbonic carp and tattoo.
The EU’s goods can also be a pardubic tissue and bitter tubes.
People want me to talk about the resistance, but I am a loversman, Okamur says.
Mr. Senator, how is the man coming to ballot on the President's post?
I don't think to be a senator or a president.
If we had all the functions in the country without problems, I wouldn't go anywhere.
But I can't see how the country is developed in the past 20 years, how woes are deceived, people have increased taxes and pension age.
I hadn't had an amb to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a solution to change it.
And since I've been over forty years and I'm an independent person who doesn't refer to any party, I'm not able to have any other opportunity to influence things except to ballot on the post of the Senator or the President.
You're in the Senate, but you've gone to the presidential lock.
Do you not turn back to people who have chosen you?
I always said that I would be involved in combating the presidential lock depending on the results of the elections in Senate.
Later I pointed out that if I'm a senator, I'll be balloted in the president.
My goal is not a position, it is a tool that I can address my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest impact and the largest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we are as a nation in the bar or in the TV, but we are ready to break a person who trys to change something.
It adds MMIs to which humans turn away, and who are free of the word with the free lying.
For example, they told me that I was taking the journalists, or that I was the adviser of Irgi Parubek.
Let's go to your views.
You have started the fight for the presidential lock with those on the material and role of political responsibilities and on returning property declarations for over twenty million.
It is necessary to change the law in order to address it.
You have no such power as the president, and only a whole senate can comply with the laws.
How do you want to resolve this task?
When I am a citizen of lobby to make the exercise free of business, it has been possible.
The problem is involved in politics - when someone comes with a good proposal left or right, it makes it a sense of obstacles, and it holds the citizens.
As an independent independent person, I have a lot of potential for support from all parliamental parties.
My privilege is that I am without partial division on the fields, without a view of the dogma, I can take every party what is best for our country and apply it.
Do you think you're a person more relative to the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, I feel that people have me more to the left.
It's not important for me, a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go forward.
It's not that someone's going to the right, but someone to the left, I want to join people.
I will always support any good decision for the society, whether the CPCM or GDP will propose it, and I will be just the same against the bad idea.
You're wrong when someone says you're popular.
But do you not prove that what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some idea of goals and views.
And you are trying to draw close to it.
It may be called popularism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they are talking about visible experts.
But without the support of the parliament, you'll have only a louzing.
And you're not going to keep it in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that when you come to people and talk to them you will be able to carry out the responsibility of voting and materially?
I don't have any other chance.
Only win politicians, journalists and publicity and try to overcome them on our side so that we can get our own.
If I had been chosen by the President, it would not have been a problem to organize a primary television translation in which I would be addressed to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties with the invitation to legalize material and voting responsibility for policies, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they should tell why they don't want it.
If there is a strong person that causes misuse, the pressure on the political scene can be demonstrated.
Take the first elections of the President, it was the service of pressure from the public.
I'm trying to say I'm a lover, not a genius, not a intellectual.
I'm trying to look for aliens to stop my convictions and views.
I'm just starting in politics, and I'm trying to support the majority for my programme.
I'm trying to move myself; if it's not possible, I'll end six years ago and return to the private sector.
This sounds often as if Okhamura should save the Czech.
I'm not a salvator.
I know that I'm not gonna do anything, so I'm going to have a number of people with a proposal to ballot in Senate.
I went to Radiu Yanchure, he refused to have a large amount of work.
I also supported at least the conducting investigation of the journalist Jan Lorenz, which discovered the potential of fuel oil products.
I've done my candidate because people are really uncomfortable, but now I'm feeling at weights.
The sixty per cent of people did not take elections, but the majority of those who had been elected by the representatives of the graduate.
Only two of us are independent in Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will be done with work.
Nevertheless, I will take place for my views, for example for the elections of the members and Governors.
Are you thinking about your own party?
I'm not still talking about this, because I don't have time to check the cleanness of every potential party, and I don't have money for this.
There are no money to the presidential campaign, just twenty thousand crowns on my transparency account.
You don't have money?
Are you talking about proper declarations, and how are your own businesses with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have parts in Prague with about 25 million, a department of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, a collection of experiences about 10 million, aston-Martin 3.5 million, and Scoda Superb per million, and more millions per account.
Instead of Aston-Martin, I appeared, because it was my little mind - I always liked James Bond, who went on the car, was a galant with women, and at the same time did he stand against submission and unrighteousness.
You're gonna go to Aston Martin, have a possession of 60 million, and you don't have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the resistance, but your own money doesn't want to contribute to it.
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I go into the Property?
I've already inserted 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors is witnessing that my program is not so interested.
And I don't have to have a pre-elected campaign from my carmen.
The expenditure for the campaign will actually cover the senatural payment.
But for these money, for example, I wouldn't have been able to make a son for an English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to work money, I wouldn't have done anywhere.
So, you're going to continue to be undertaken so that you can live?
Didn't you say that you would decrease this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the size of the payment.
As I promised, I had partly reduced my activity.
For example, the Director of the Tourist Agency will be my substitute.
People would like me to be a freedom of money that would keep the resistance.
But I have to live for something too.
How much, how much of the business, have you used to get every month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, I get more.
And if I was the President, my business would have ended.
You'll find a full interview on the Sabbath issue of the "Raw" newspaper.
MVRDV architects show that the present conclusions are not only in imagination - such as Speikeniss and its recently built Book Mountain - 2
"I'm funny, it looks futuristic, and we can see something interesting again," says Lizette Verhage, walking on the road side.
And St. Spermon, the IT specialist of a major company's neighborhood, thinks, "No, it's really beautiful."
But I wonder, why do we have another library today?
All have the Internet, iPad and electronic books.
No one's walking in such ancient libraries now, right?
Speikeniss, a little notable room town under Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
His population has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
For a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and to build seven industrial pools represented on the banknotes, as a lively broken iron miniature.
The success of this lighting initiative was modesty.
Then the town’s fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to acquire statistics: build a library here!
Maas's vine from the Rotterdam →Ecttural Office of MVRDV, the master of courageous column graphs and author of the ostrims, sometimes even cyclic buildings, refer to the task of its usual insultity and appeared on competitive audience in 2003 with five books under mouse and disturbance.
And while the members of the jury looked up and washed by the bottles, the dear Maas made a piramide from its original gift by size and ended the thing to protect his project by saying, "Respected citizens!"
That's my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Speakeniss, so called Buckenberg!
After nine years, this mountain was worth 30 million.
It is part of the project of revitalisation, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, pool and several resident houses and townhouses in general for 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, "The Book Mountain" was noted by the second premium of the "The Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the National Netherlands Concurrence of Tree Arms in 2012.
Thus, a lot of salary that could not earlier offer anything except the postmodernist preliminary area and an amazing increasing rate, white phases that are indicated in the mind of the milkwater, more rich to one modern production of the ICT.
But the main thing in Speikeniss was the first in the history of this town was public from the cultural assignment.
Long Path to the Book
First impression: Eldorado under the cocktail for syra.
There is only one lift walking in the center of the mountain mass, because the true electric and reading worshippers will prefer to investigate this accommodation.
It is light and easily obscure from all sides, the fields of the burned cyrpic and the elegant characteristics of the city are unfortunately making feelings of the public area.
The city environment is perfect.
It seems to be unfreely looking for scarlets, dogs, and players for boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"In general, books are standing at the middle of fascinations, and there is a large dark room in the middle of the middle of the dark room, as it is usually inappropriate and unusual," says Vinny Maas.
We placed a classic configure of space from the feet to the ground and put out the area to read outside.
Internal booking space is used in a sense: Offices, Internet library, shachmate club, environmental centre and technical locations are available in the centre.
In particular, black books that serve the wall, the parapetes, and the forests.
Their species, texture, and darkness are unusual.
Even the tested engineers and engineers are lost in opinions that this is not the material.
"We were trying to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, a project holder, representing Speikenises community, with the requirements of the standard.
And once in one agrar company in Frisland, we met a suitable farming product.
For many years in the heat and fields in the Netherlands, the experimental vulcnistic material of the limmeter dilution is applied as a subcutaneous board under the root.
It's rain and economy time.
The tongue textile serves one or two season, then it can be cut out.
For the library, the first of these volumes was pressed in the four centimeter width panel.
Understanding and pressure of the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) is converted into dark, unique, slow material, a little reminder of a new car and a little crossing.
The top is 105 degrees.
Whoever overcomes a long road of approximately 500 meters will be rewarded in a literary coffee not only by a tastatic species to the city but also by the Netherlands croquets and the ancient figs in the worsts.
They will forget the atmosphere and, firstly, the right air power on the literary mountain.
New soul losses
"It's hard to believe, but it's from, despite the steel tops, it's a model project in the environment," says Troubourst.
The heat of the earth is used for its devotion and cold.
Although the Big Mount is under the steel, even in clear days the sun falls within a little while.
Width farms of the clothed wooden woods that are divided by the perpendicules of a glass fascinated, give darkness and take greater part of the sun.
The climate in the house is very pleasant.
Remote protection provides completely auto-rolled stones.
Stermon, mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lisethe Verhage was here too.
As well as the professor of the traditional Chinese medical teacher Sintia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "Speakeniss soul, who has been missing for a long time."
Reason: In a few weeks before the opening, each inhabitant received a invitation to attend one book from the own congregation.
These books should have taken empty spaces on the fields yet not completely comprehensive library - at that point there were 70,000 books.
I've got the idea.
The poles have confidence.
"Nothing worse than a half empty library," says Vinnie Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident is now somehow with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this publication.
Even if she serves only for the curse.
Hence, MVRDV has been able to resolve the king's task called on the professional gargon to create identity.
Speikeniss wrote his literature story.
And let them be very young and unfair.
It's just a start point to build identity.
"The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany continued to vote on Palestinian recognition.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the Property, Berlin balances the low diplomatic.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week, Germany dreamed to understand that she was voting against the Palestinian request for the obtaining of the status of the observator to the United Nations.
But then Berlin stayed at the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israel's actions in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be a lot in relation to Israel.
But at the same time, I think it doesn't support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, not being too critical to Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also continued to vote on the introduction of a prohibition zone for flights.
This proposal was carried out by the NATO.
Is Germany difficult to take a clear position on complex issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its external policy, and it is exactly to the policy that the United States, as a result, were governed to the German foreign policy.
Additionally, the situation is complicated with the lack of a single policy.
Thus, Germans are again between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they have not used it.
I believe that while they only play their role, they are on the way to the "best" external policy.
Such external policy conducted by France or Greece.
What does the "normal" external policy mean with German viewpoint?
It is ready to take place in its national interests, not depending on the position of the United States or Peace partners.
I believe that German external policy depends on economic policies, such as exports and relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are significantly different from the interests of other major States, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the near-east conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has major markets on the Middle East, in particular in the Persian village states.
It therefore needs to be cautious to avoid publicity and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I wouldn't have added this too much, it's not a completely one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the numbers of Germans.
Did Germany hold up with the United States by holding important decisions such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that the German position is overwhelmed in the Property and even in the United States.
That's why I don't think that it was the same drama, like in the Libyan issue.
Germany may even receive such a certain respect.
Because this signals that it should be considered seriously as a player in the international area and that it should be considered with its interests.
There are different opinions on Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the United States claimed exactly to the vote.
Does the opinions between the United States and many Peace States have?
In force of the American internal policy, such differences have always been different.
I believe that the Government of Obama has sufficient understanding of the position of Peace.
However, with regard to the political situation, the Government cannot openly take place.
I believe that the consequences in opinions are not as significant as it always appears.
If you consider the term between Obama and the Prime Minister of Netanyah, note that Obama is not absolutely concerned with the Netanyah policy.
Is Germany easy to comply with its close relationships with Israel and the United States with one side and the situation of the most important partner in the EU with the other?
I think that's just what makes the situation so difficult for Germans.
Of course, the Germans would have been a few easier if it had been a single, unlike the Peace policy, but it is not right now.
Thus, they cannot be in a larger approach and have to take place with only their own view of the situation.
That's what they're going on with.
I think in the future, Germany will take a leading role in you in the common position of Peace.
It is clear that it is not easy for Germany, at least because of the relationship with Israel.
The subject was always nice.
But I think Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany sees himself in the role of an important international player, will she really take a major role in herself?
Or does the leading role still be given to Germany?
Dutch has not yet been used to do so, it is always uncomfortable, and, evidently, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the crisis is every time Germany plays an important role, the most different anti-hearts feelings are.
The Germans are not just to cope with that.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be circumcised by enemy countries.
From this point, Germany is in a significantly more difficult situation than the United States.
It must take into account the most different neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
The impact of the United States on Peace policy continues to be weak, but the EU does not now fill this vaccine, and who will then remain?
Germans must just play a more significant role.
Even if you don't like it, it's ungrateful or strengthening unbelief to you, it's a life like this!

"The protection of goods" in China: when Puma and Armani will suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a worldwide trade mark, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
But what's Armani Polo?
This is completely officially registered in China, which does not have anything in connection with companies from which it has been designed.
However, it will be preserved until the owners of the original names have requested.
But then it is not clear whether they will be able to detain their rights.
"Foreigners are more difficult to protect their trade marks in China," says Thomas Pa日loh, Taylor Wessing company, which specializes the rights of good marks on the Next East.
On my table every week there is a new case of such a kind.
Imitators are sufficient to add a few letters to get the right to register their trade signs.
Thus, it is from Gu's Lu-Gu, instead of Prada can be registered in Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German undertakings, such as the manufacturer of Puma, are copied fully.
It opens a folder with the records of the registration of good signs in Peking.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, which also used the name of the Modern House Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions for copying and violating intellectual property rights, it is.
In large towns, there are multiple universities that sold nearly exclusive shares.
However, the cases of Pa’Noah are not such, but, by the order of his trusters, he strives against that Chinese undertakings are officially obtained from the registration of good signs and the right to use a name which is already protected anywhere else.
China's name is "ban minpay", a markup-passage.
This word is associated with "docuan ban".
That is what women are called about rich men.
Chinese authorities do not recognize their faults
"This is the damage of business, which is needed to be done with this," is required by Pa·Loh.
"The trade mark is dismissed, the unique situation is lost, the imatge suffers very much."
Financial losses and processing of losses of adults are calculated as millions, especially in the case of delightful copied products.
According to the CLSSA market investigation undertaking, China with a total of 15 billion dollars per year is the third of the size and the fastest market of the scope.
However, it is difficult to remove doubt records in the trade signs record, and it is worth.
The process may take up until nine years, with unexpected result.
Pa·loch reports about the cases in which the court has rejected the debt, since, after long-term, the opposite name was "the reality of the market".
If the island doesn't succeed, he'll even have to pay the plagiator because he has caused the damage of his trade mark in China, says Pa.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
There are also notices about graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a court with the building machine manufacturer of Sany, a company which soon had received a Battononso-producer company of Putzmeister.
Therefore, Chinese to these pounds have the right to use the brain like Mercedes star.
The buying Volvo company Geely initially exposed a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of modern goods in Lacoste has lost their imitants in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose namely crocodile was looking at the other side.
Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registration of CTMO signs in Peking confirms that in 2010, because of the lack of the staff and staff equipment, there were difficulties.
But in the past year, the "return from the emergency situation in slavery to normal."
Yes, the number of negative reactions was reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81.500 claims are still waiting for production.
To fight this worthwhile
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year, CTMO has made more than 1,4 million declarations on trade marks, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has set up a list of new records worldwide in ten times, reporting awareness.
The same is the total number of trade marks, only 5.5 million tonnes.
In 2011 1,8 billion assemblies were paid.
If it is easy, it means that each registration is in the average of 1280 Juan or 160.
It is a lot more to resist it as it shows the case of the German family undertaking of gladnberg.
For more than seven years, the concert fights against the Chinese plagiator.
The Germans were able to find that the illegal production of their car details was eliminated.
However, the imitator strengthened the Chinese rights for a trade mark of gladnberg.
This was a own destruction, since families in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, president of the Government of Lucnberg Chemical Specialities in München.
The registration of trade signs of CTMO has also rejected the claim of the monkeys.
True, in both places, the joynberg wins, but the opposite side continues to fight until these pounds.
We need to wait.
The question is now discussed in the Court of Justice.
Wentzler hopes to bring the matter to good end and praise the practicalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Process is extremely straight, and we have a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal debt of food should be taken into account that the company’s archive had to examine even the acts of the age in order to demonstrate the performance.
Five years ago, gladnberg offered the opposite side "the greatest six-signed amount in" for the regulation.
"From here clearly how precious it is for us," says Wentchler.
The dangers of the Next East are threatened even to be moved into.
Exactly, if the imiters register unprotected trade signs.
Yes, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name of gladnberg for skin and skin products.
Concern has long stopped the production in these areas, but despite that it has been to prevent the register.
"We need to wait," says Wentchler.
Similarly, as well as Pa·Pa·Loh recommends that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not sufficient to be confident in the situation on the protection of goods, but the foreigners should "all that anyway should be protected, also registered in China," says Venceller.
Otherwise, this can be much more worth than registration.
In fact, if gladnberg is lost in the last act of his drama on the trade mark, it will have to make the opposite side license collections for its own name, it explains Venceller.
Otherwise, we will be exhausted from the market in the segment.
World Day of AIDS: to shoot, to sing, to help
The Hour of Ibongi repeated in Haidelberg, and the poverty of IDA in Swaziland rejoiced in this.
History, above the race, more than 8733 km.
The dream is distributed at the same time: Cowboy sapoes, basketballs, damical bottles and men's bags are electing a tax on the parked field and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that long growth, the voice of the songs is Alt, Base, Tenor and Supreno - they are stumbled, and follow each other.
And Fitty Hopf, a 29-year-old director, is almost not going out of his mother-in-law, when they are with their guilty and exposure.
On Monday evening, the Medical Psychology Institute in Haidelberg Hor Ibongi repeated a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from human genetic specialists to court.
"Om" Obaney" is a very simple thing, each people's voice has its text, and in a completely strange language: Zulus, on which eleven million people speak in Southern, Botswana, Lesoto, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to UNIDs, the United Nations Affairs Programme, worldwide is estimated about 34 million HIV infected.
23.5 million of them will be south.
In Swaziland, 245.000 poverty lives.
More than 40 per cent of HIV populations are in place.
For 180 poor poor IDA in the village of Essidene Voices for Africa, there were heads in Germany.
70 of them are visiting a school preparing for further education.
On 15 or 20 a.m., a headship can be taken for each month.
It guarantees the child's money for school, school form and everyday hot dinner in Gogo-Â.
Imbongy in Zulus language means a story or a loving.
In this room they're not running to the bank, so they can sing.
Almost ten years the horr learns the songs in this strange language and brings them from time to time again, where they first appeared: south.
Because at the distance of 8733 kilometers from Haidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village of Essygeni, which depends on the votes of German people.
Forty percent of identified
There will be approximately 2.000 people, some of them, in pure springs of glass and salmons, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them remained without parents who died from the IH virus.
Asygena in the miniature reflects the illness of all Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest expected life in the world by UNICEF.
The surrounding of the extreme body in men, which evidently reduces the risk of half infection, has been almost not accepted.
More than 40 percent of the population of Swaziland have immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not rare.
Hor opened this village in a joint vessel in 2005, but the participants first saw their children in age, not only with parents, but also simply: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, there is no chance in the poor country.
This was a private commitment to individual participants - for a few years to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to get a burning food once a day.
But a year later, the core was based on the "Voices for Africa", which, with those couples, has been professionally forgotten of the poor poor in Essijen.
Factors of sexual infections
What are the most important diseases translated by sex?
Bacteriaal IPPs are related to sifilis, chlamidiace and triple (gonorea).
Partial virus IPPs I'm HIV, Papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Lobby pedicules and seasons are related to the parasite IPP.
What are the main groups concerned?
Siphilis and honour are primarily meeting men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koha Institute comes from the fact that at least four of the five cases of the sifilis registered in Germany are being transferred by sexual contacts between men.
Getherosexual adults often faced with sexual illnesses, I have chlamidae infections, trihomoniase, candidate (gryboc), honorry and papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV between generozexual adults is compared to low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are on this group.
Chlamidia infections among youths are more frequently than among other population groups.
Three quarters of all infections have affected young people from 15 to 25 years.
We are also often meeting a papillom virus among youths.
How is the number of infection cases changed?
Not all sexually translated diseases shall be subject to the obligation of registration.
Sifilis disease, given by the Robert Koha Institute, was more than 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been reduced since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate the illness of the vener?
Infectional diseases may result in genital disorders, complaints in mocheising, Property, life pain, and puzzle or inflammation.
However, they are often not affecting pains and other symptoms and remain unobserved.
How can we protect us?
Preservatives are able to reduce the risk of infection, but they do not give a hundred-percent protection.
Since partly the illnesses of sex may also be distributed by contact infection and in a close contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigation, especially when sexual partners are frequently changed.
In the early diagnosis, most of the IPP can be treated and avoided remote consequences.
The leadership, and nonetheless honourers for the statement of people throughout Germany are allowed to collect something.
"We've sent it all to Esygena for about 200 000," says Anne Lennartz, president of the Assembly.
In the most town of Germany, the Codewa Dlamina is a cognitive and active woman.
She will also forget that the poor are well built, such as one of the grandfathers.
Goose, as they call the Zulus old women, is the opposite of the village.
They accepted up to 14 poverty, gave them a cover over the chair, and forgot that children should be learned every day in the form.
Those who have not been born have progress to Hannisil, a single woman who receives a payment from the union, as well as two feeds prepared each day for more than 200 hungry children.
Furthermore, the "Voices for Africa" association organized a Swedish school, built two puzzles and together with the United States Health Health Organization organized a successful HIV analysis for many village populations.
It is difficult to say, but the disease that is so obvious throughout the country prefers to be deeply silent.
King of 14 Women
"Id is a absolute tab," says Anne Lennartz, "for he is with sexuality."
It is sufficient for a country where the king is officially 14 women.
The last absolute mon of black, King Msvati III, is his love for losses.
Polygamie instead of democracy.
In particular, in such a so-called state of life, it is also the wine that the IH virus has been so rapidly spread in the past years.
But it is also located on shipowners who differ the virus by the country.
Free reserves are literally on each angle, says Anne Lennartz, "but they are almost not used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
In order to support a little cultural exchange, the Hor Ibmogney makes each two-three years of swimming south and poet songs, full grass, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many in the southern edge of the Black Continent know from the time of the apartment.
The bus, full of white men who sing songs in black language, is not only a good consciousness and joy, but even a laugh in the eyes of sure borders.
The train is always leading to Estijen, where the songs are visiting subheading children.
Although a small village with work can be found on the map, it is more than it is in the Ecualvania river valley.
"Go to Easygen, there's a world," they say, "the people of the world."
And after the 8733 miles back to Haidelberg, when heavy songs return to the Repetition Hall in Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light burns also here.
Senator: NASA opens ice in Mercuria
The Massenger Zone found evidence of that there is ice on the Mercurie planet.
The ice cover may have a width of 20 meters.
Cosm’s NSA's statement proved that the ice is on the Mercurie planet.
Although it is situated closer to the sun, there is also a swimming water, as shown from three studies held on Thursday in the special magazine Science.
The Massenger Zone found evidence of the continuous cover of the planet's region's covering island.
The length of it must be at least 30 centimeters, perhaps even 20 meters.
Previously, the water occurs with the comet or maybe the asteroid, I'm stuck with Mercurie.
No one relates to the opening of ice with life on the planet, said the Scientific Roomer of Shawn Solomon.
Mercurie temperature can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these openings could help to explain how water and other buildings are made in other areas of the Solar System.
Inconsistently, for the people of the Earth, telescope and small works such as Phenix, the depths of the universe are investigated.
From time to time, they send to Earth: Small eyes to unfinished gifts.
The picture comes from the camera that the German researchers from the Plank Institute have been held.
Eight planets of our Solar System, as well as the cartridge planet of Cerer.
Like Pluton, who is around the Sun after Neptune, Cerea, after the new definition of the international astronomy Union of 2006, is not "planed".
This Fragment of the Infrastructure Photo of the "Spicer" telescope represents "the family portrait" of unnumbered star generations: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, the more difficult to identify rose "nuclear" stars in the star around.
This is a non-romantical region of the Sciences called it W5 - openly opened in the Cassiopean constellation of 6500 light years.
This bullet of the dead photographic star is the NASA "Spicer telescope".
It seems that the ring is from the material that the star has expelled in the process of death.
In the gygantic tube of Trifid, remote for 5400 light years from Earth, new stars appear.
The NASA "Spicer" telescope made this graph of the galaxy of the family Hall.

One of the biggest and clearest photos of the Habble Telescope: Gala’s Waterport
On the basis of the flower-free photographs of spying galls, the experiences are converted to the current production.
The photograph of the South Paece observer shows a remote Thriphid in the Star of the Arrows for a few thousand light years.
The name of Trifid occurs from the latin term trifidus (three dollars, three-sized) because the dark pools of the stars are divided into three parts of the hearts of the stars.
In the Smith Star, astronomic photograph is the proclaimer of the Earth: 400 million world years from the Earth of two glasses are not met and are unsecure.
This is the birth of the Habble telescope in the M83 spiral chain.

This star dumbness is the lightest group of new stars of our Milkway.
The star columb always creates new stars.
This is a star cloud that is combined with Rosetka's dumbness, which also creates new stars -- a distance of 5000 light years from Earth.
In this bright light gate, there is no small black bottle yet, only gas.
Researchers assume that it has occurred almost before the Great Explomation when the universe was mainly watered.
Our views in the universe: most important telescope
The telescope was probably exhausted in 1608 in Hanso Lippersgay - even before Galileo Galileo came to monitor the stars for a year later.
From those pounds, optical telescopes have become more - and more deeply available to their view of space.
During 30 years, which was from 1947 to 1975, the Hall telescope in Palomar under San Diego was the greatest telescope in the world.
The stars pictured here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, "The Best Binocu Telescope".
He allows the space to be watched by two stars, each diameter 8.4 meters.
The Green Telescopio Canarias has a gigant internal device -- a diameter of only a serpent contains 10,4 metres.
The Sercalo "Larger South African Telescope" in South Africa has been segmentated for reduction of value.
However, it reaches about 11 metres in the diameter.
The lack of an active performance: the telescope is heavyly fixed under the vertical angle - it is its subtle.
The telescope "Hobby-Eberley" in Texas has also a fixed vertical angle.
His particularity: Highlight ability.
It reaches, despite a comparatively small diameter of the serpent, the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
A radiotelescope in Arisbo (Puerto Rico) is assisted by researchers to adhere to foreign signals in the space.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the "Search foreign times" project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its calculating power.
The species of the observer of the Peace Astronomy of the Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
"Very big telescope" here is a completely corresponding name.
Its four stars are allowed to light in the spectacular tube even the average infrarroad.
It is also planned to establish a very large telescope in the Chile.
Its main wheel must be spread at a maximum of 42 metres - and will be composed of approximately 1000 winter elements.
However, the graphs should be expected not before 2018.
Before 2007, both the "Kek" telescope on the Hawai Wow Maun Kea was considered the most important world.
There are two stars of a diameter of ten meters.
The telescope "Kee" is being observed in Maun-Kea, which is also looking at them in the sky by the Sobar telescopes and the IRT.
Moreover, Moun-Kea has to appear a new hygantic telescope - with a zerum diameter of thirty meters.
Here they can be loved for illustrations.
However, the most important species of the space are putting the "Habble" space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he sets pictures of worlds remote.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope "Kee'r" will search for the planets in the Solar System - especially those on which the life is.
On 2 February 2011, the NASA reported that 1235 candidates were found since the start of the mission.
The final preparation of the "Keyr" telescope has been signed on the graphics.
The Cosmic Telescope James Webba (JWST) will be sent to the space before 2018 on the board of the Arian 5 box.
The main telescope of the infrared space has a diameter of 6,5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it must look for a big explosion in the light of the first stars and galla.
Scientists assume that there is ice on the southern pool of Mercuria.
However, there are no reliable data about it, since the "Messenger" turns closer to the northern area of the planet.
Decades of radar plans indicated that there is ice in Mercurie.
Thanks to the "Messenger" Zone in 2004, the first who turns around Mercuria is now sure.
Drink oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In South Azerbaijan, many populations have reached more than age in the Bible.
There's even a long-term museum here.
Searching for a review in the country where 97-year-old elders are still compared to young.
In South Azerbaijan, many populations have reached more than age in the Bible.

Searching for a review in the country where 97-year-old elders are still compared to young.
Travel through the Talush Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
Microatobus with a widespread whisper is thrown outside the woods of mountains, furniture and simple cross-border houses.
Everything around is so green and light that you can think you're in Svartzwald.
But this is the southern border of Azerbaijan, the Iran border is only in several kilometers from here.
There will be a lots - one of the people of Kawka, about which there is a little, not only what they speak in Farsi and Azerbaidian and are different from a long-term.
The end is Laric.
The small town is too weak by the Soviet Soviet Times, which does not completely harmonize with a living-written mountain landshaft.
The tourists from the nearly come here, the way from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too disturbing.
323 km away is eight hours, since the road has only one road.
The legendary richness of the country of the Caspian Sea is here, in the province until it reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) was convinced that there is nothing to be interested in the tourists in Lerica.
"In May, Baku was celebrated by the fascinating song, and in the year we have a fascil of the elderly people of the world," says Fatulaev.
She's a long-term museum manager, probably the only one in the world.
There is a documented biography of approximately eight hundred talents of those who are more than 100 years.
It's my grandmother, he's here 120 years.
At the age of 136 years, he was born another child
But the star of the Museum is the Shirali Muslim Chuban, which was as if 168 years had been fulfilled.
The testimony of birth, however, is not.
In the light of the 122 years, the age of Muslimov is extremely doubtful to the elderly person whose age was under documents.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, who had 136 years of age as if she had been born a daughter.
Did the Muslim's boy add a few decades to his age?
Because even Remberdt Scholz, age study from the Plank Institute in Rostoka, heard about the debtors in Central Asia.
"Parliamentally many people of age can also meet in some areas of China, Japan, or in Hunza's valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "is also very old people in Sardinia."
However, because of the lack of documents, the science under age is not because there was no civil status records.
Each day, it's oil.
Yet, there is a fact that people in the area of Laric have often reached the age of the Bible.
Now 20 people live here more than 100 years old.
Why is this a lot of debtors in the south?
The Azerbaijan Explorer Farid Mugimzade explains that by the genes of a lower.
The Directive of the Fatulah Museum, in contrast, believes that the matter is in food.
The wallets love meat, bread and most milk products, many drink the oil on the stack every day, but the high-calorial diet can be healthy with the diotheological point of view.
Or the case in the first form of life that keeps people in youth? In Chengaming, a small village near the city of Lerick, Rubab Mizziova lives.
In 97 years, she is still very young for these widths.
Mizzajeva, who claims that she has 143 seeds, lives in a simple tree house, typically for all the Kakao region.
She's sitting on the floor with a bottle oil that cates out there without stone.
There will be eight men, including one of the sons and the daughters of Mizcai, who have already had their grandparents for a long time.
The nearby is two young ones.
In the kitchen of guests, the tea is prepared under the typical puzzle of the armode.
The Mizcai has perfectly white and white teeth, which is hiding the long dark-rush hairs that her son has with bitterness revealed before us.
I always have the hair with milk, so they have never fallen and kept the color.
"And I've never had a shampoon," says Mirzevava.
A monthly pension is enough to live
She always grows just in her own court, mimidors, cartoffles, mountains.
I've never bought products in the store for all my life.
Then she tells her husband who served in the army.
The most difficult was after the Second World War.
But it's been better when the "loyal father" Gadar Aliev got up at the road.
The propaganda does not often sound in the words of an old woman.
However, the culture of a nation's father's figure, which rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaidjan, is almost not aware of the border.
He had authority until 2003, then he adopted his son Ilham's wrath of government.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijan elders.
230 monates (approximately equal to the same amount) Mizjeva receives each month as a pension, for the holders it is the amount to be well-leavened.
And maybe a longer growing son of Mizziah's rights are also: "Starics in our culture use deep respect."
They will be in a large family, loved, surrounded with forbidden and happy.
What no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is not in constitution
Revolution returned to Cair.
Contemporary demonstrations in Cairo testify about the deep crowd of the country.
The future constitution, which is on the chariate, has occurred to a cruel opposite.
The Egyptian president did not buy a paphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success is on my responsibility to the people and to the people," he said on public television.
His speech was turned to all the people, but in the first place, to Christian captains, Liberals, Muslims, and non-religious Egypt.
Because all of them, unexpectedly dismissed in the distressing opposition, experience fear.
The fear of the religious state in Nile for the powerful "brothers Muslims".
Mohammed Mursy, almost unexpectedly, said that he temporarily dismissed the competence of the Constitutional Court and extended his competence to save the revolution.
However, that actually wants to save a 61-year-old engineer who has a degree of the American University of South California's doctor will not be completed clearly by Egypt and throughout the world.
Will the power of justice be deceived?
Actually, the 234 articles have been able to pass in a 15-hour 15-hour spring with anxiety to the islamist constitutional meeting of 100 participants, which is partly threatened.
Like in the previous constitutions, the project states that the court-production is addressed to "the principle of the Islamic Right".
But what does it mean "principes"?
It was and remained in interpretation, and it could be threatened that the islamists would use a spreading formula and a legal leaf for more closer interpretation of the charity.
At least, one new article is intended: In all cases, Casa’s chariate, it should be attached to the Council of the University of Al-Ashar, the most important islamist establishment of the country that uses great authority in all Sunnith Islam.
This should not be, but it may mean that the spiritism is supervised by the law that the de facto would have the consequence of the judicial authority.
The draft constitution is a lot of interpretation
Another issue: Citizens must be subjected to military court.
These courts during the Mubarak authorities served in order to enhance opponents.
After the execution of the dictator in military prison, up to 11.000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the project, the State should protect "the real reality of the Egyptian family" and "the support of its moral and value."
It is legally unfair that public institutions with this article can even control the content of films and literature.
It doesn't mean anything other than the censure.
In fact, none of the articles set up directly men and women.
So the other prohibits the Prophet Muhammed and His messengers.
But what's about the divorce and how it should be, it remains unexpected.
There is also a doubt that the formula is prohibited by the "prohibition of people".
Is it enough for the president's charitation or a juice in respect of justice?
The question of interpretation as well as many in this project, which Mussi will sign and which, as he said, "very quickly" will be represented to the Egyptian referency.
"Revolution returned"
A few weeks has been formed a opposition against the prevalence of the islamists.
Decades of thousands of people were gathered in an unusual unity at the dinner at the Tachir area in Cairo and sworn to set up this document before it was able to enter into force.
"Revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place for presidential elections.
Laureat of Nobel's peace premium and the former international atomic energy holder Mohammed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution was "for the story".
The service of short news of Twitter was accused of Mursi's complainants to call "putch against democracy".
"If he announces a reference, we'll go to his court and throw it out," said Oppositioner Jasser Said.
"We have not yet established, the blood of our brothers has not yet been released," quoted the Egyptian media for the oppositional policy of Haleda Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it ineffective.
Coran is our constitution.
The well-organised Brothers Muslims, in their range, called to the opposite demonstration, but, with caution, not to Tachir, but after a mass prayer at the other Nela before the Cairo University.
It participated in a large number of women under the coverages and charges of salafites who cried, "The people need to apply God's law."
They need Morse: "Clean the country!" and they assured, "The Koran is our constitution."
The fight for the power over the symbolic area at which all started is a result of the presumptuously civil war.
Mussie's followers, obviously, did not want to go to this risk.
"Brothers Muslims" claimed that both the opposers and the parties of the Constitution project were pronounced very clearly.
Now it was time to give the people a decision in the electoral time where the country should go.
Most islamists' projects are considered as a decision.
"The understanding of human rights" doesn't mention anyway"
Hafiz Abu Saed in anger from this forced constitutional process, which, likely, had to be held to February with all public forces.
48-year-old ' s human rights and the president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization protected the " Brothers Muslims" when they were sitting in or before the court at Mubarak.
Not because he divided them with peace, but because the rights of human rights for him are no part.
That's why he was killed, condemned, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are not meet in a new constitution, he is sorry in conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The enlargement of the impact of Mursy on all three powers in the State disappoints.
These measures are evidence of the democratic rules of the game and will bring Egypt to the new dictature.
"Instead of strengthening the citizen State, the President de facto annuled it," saith.
Because without civil public organizations, democracy can not work.
Saida feels that all have abandoned him, even a international community, who looks at the ideological fight against the Nile directions with the mixing of interest and pressure.
It may be a payment for this.
The Demonstrate on the area of Tachir warns, "You're creating a monster you're not able to control."
Norway cancer: The most stupidly inspiring fish in the world?
The 5 million people of Norway have one of the highest levels of life not only in the Property but also in the world.
Perhaps the secret of the success of this country is somewhat appealing to one extremely evil fishing vessel?
Take a few revisions of the syringes.
Put them into a cup of wounded and post-evented clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get a disgusting rack-shake, one of the most famous Norwegian partcates.
I'm in a small town named Fagernes, three hours ago from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air, it's going to be a different characteristic.
Racfisc is a forel, a sugar salt and a shiping in water for a year, depending on what soul it must be.
As soon as summers are cold and cold, the norvegians are gathered to the faxal in Fager, which is dedicated to it, we say that they are captive of food.
"Their eats and drinks with a rubber of acvavite, a dark water," explains Havard Halvarsen, a carrying fuel on the profession and the association of the " cancer general", which will be conducted by the physician.
Everywhere around us, people eat with a small fish cubic and drink it with a big portion of the spirit.
"Nobody likes more aquavate than a cancer," says Havard.
This drink is able to cross the deep.
I'm trying a couple of cookies.
If you can carry the cow under the nose, it's not so bad - it's a little different from the sush portion that you've been driving with you in the bus.
Racfisc is a Norwegian product from other times, the time of poverty, when, before the holodillers appeared, the fish of the ocean was locked in hermetically closed bottles with salt water.
Then the deep winter, when the fish had already been well and basically lost, it was extracted and used in food.
Moreover, in the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norways had to leave their country in the search of work and, mainly, emigrate in the United States.
Now, the population is more than 13 per cent of immigrants, which bring here slaves, high payments and the development of the security system.
Sweden's residents (a longer than so longer and much more enjoyable neighborhood) are coming to work here.
Racfisc is considered as a significant symbol, increasingly, even though a few crime elements of the past Norway.
It's one of the lovers of the hot.
On the other hand, there's a little bird or a sandwich that will be worth 9 pounds of sterling (14 dollars).
Norway is rare in world news, and most of the people of the country seems to be established.
People here before these couples have not yet mentioned the name of Anders Bravic, the racist and the extremist of the right to it, who was shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the therapy calls "the happening 22 July".
The Norwegians are very difficult to believe that one of their constructions in their peaceful country has been able to kill such animals and animals.
On the basis of today's welfare, Norway is a growth (from the beginning of the seventy-five) of one of the most major oil growths in the world.
"The same oil is not the only reason for our floracy," says Anna, our officer, which has a variety of submissions with a sustained cancer, a woman with a long light hair and a deeply deep eyes, the inflation of the north well-being.
We're a people like that, as you call it is reasonable.
Like most Norways, she speaks English.
We don't like to show, we're not crazy.
Norway is very interesting in its oil - most of the incomes of petroleum growth are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years preceding the world financial crisis, when all of them had no money, Norway was deeply calculated all losses.
"Before you can fall on the winter's beaches and walk in the course of a year, it's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a cancer," she adds with an unusual smile.
I'm standing in the snow in the snow for some food, a cancer with me.
Here's a hamburger with a hot meat, it's exactly an exotic, a sweet meat.
But at evening we are still greater than the same fish with an unforgettable dishes.
In my holiday, there is a special dinner, dedicated cancer, where the visitors determine the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
And it's a direct television, in which the leader's in the rubber-baby, surrounded with cancer.
This seems to be a song of the "Eurovideance" competition.
"So, Tor-Jurgen, what kind of fish you put for the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Havard, here's our wedding."
They're all ridiculous and exploded.
Someone's falling out of the stone, maybe the aquatic.
Or, maybe, just breathing this fish.
President Me’s Enrike Penny Neto is a weak beginning of the career.
Until the newly elected President Me’s Enrike Penny Neto is ready to enter into the position, the representative BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he needs to face, and to the mixed expectations of his country's population.
Before the movement in Mexico is now in particular crying.
This city was overcome by transport and at the best time, and from Monday there were hundreds of constructions that were overturned by several key magazines to the table and calling a chaos on the roads.
However, it was not made to allow people to gain the benefits, but to refrain from the protesting parties to deal with the Parliament.
On Sunday, the new Chapter Me’s Enrike Penny Neto will submit the presidential commitment and take the degree of the government by the country.
It's not a simple job before him.
I have received good economic indicators in the Federation of Felipe Calderon, which now holds its powers, but the country has threatened the battle with drugs, which has already brought 60,000 lives for six years.
"My Government states to the people of Me'aki about its willingness to handle violence," Mr. Pny New President of the United States Baraku Obama reported earlier this week in the White House's Office.
I'm going to propose a new security which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before such statements, the political career of Mr. Penny Neto was developed at the post of the Governor of his family state of Mexico.
His family, in a guestone and extensive state, the country's surrounding capital, was divided by the opinions of the new ruler.
A Muslimian person
In the town of Vale-de-Bravo, for example, they remember it with warmth.
Inhabitants serve him for the survival of tourism, the development of the curriculum and the creation of the infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new heads built by Mr. Penny Neito, which are different from the road with rocks and jackets that were previously on this.
Tables with its name are present in the present opinion of the Centre and the impressive interactive museum, dedicated to climate changes.
"We have hopes with him for real and serious changes," says his friend and political union, Gabriel Olver Ernandes, a Congressman of the State of the New Institution-Revolution Party (PRI).
We expect actual and resolved changes that are so heavy in our country, first in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of improving residence in the PRI party, Vicente Fox was embarrassed in 2000.
The Congressman of Olver admits that after his 12-year lack in the presidential court of Los Pinos party, the party is increasingly hoped for Enrique Püny Neto.
Moreover, he rejects the accusations of inconsistency, which led to the new president of the opposition.
He is very direct and very devoted to the case of its future vision.
It's an excellent State actor, and, in particular, a person who can listen.
But in the other part of the state, many people had another idea of the former Governor.
The Municity of Nesaulkootl, also called Suid-Ness, is the most rare contrast with the potential of Vale-de-Bravo.
He is hidden under the steaks of cars, and in many ways he is the reward of the same Mexican.
And the problems in the municipality also have a severe nature of this megapolis.
This year previously, the bands of drug trafficking in these areas have been hosted by military, and violence against women has been a strong nature here.
There were only few decades of killed women in the wilderness in the last two years.
More than thousands of women were killed in Mexico during the Government of Mr. Phinja Neto - this is significantly higher than the same indicator in the town of Suid-Huarès, whose name became narcate when the number was about the murder of innocent women.
According to the representatives of Mr. Penny Neto, in the best case, it can be said that during his residence on the post of the Governor he had not been able to cope with the problem of murdering women.
In the worst case, his administrator is accused of fully ignoring this problem.
The Beton House resident, like most houses in this district area, is Irenea Bundia hardly holding the ladders by graphing her relaxed daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Marian, self-mord was committed in 2010.
However, her family thinks she had killed her companion.
"When I arrived to her home, it seemed that her body was cut off before it," recalls Mrs. Bundia.
There were signs of what it was killed, and the body was already cut off.
Mariana's mother refers to this story, and the portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where he will stand near the disappointment, on which only one word is drawn: justice.
That was exactly what they said, that family was rejected.
"The duties of the states have been viewed with me as an old agency, a lack of peace.
They want people to accept all that they say and deceive.
But it's wrong, so it's, especially when so many disturbances and unreads are around," she says.
As the presidential translation on the Sabbath, President Penny Neto will take an unfair responsibility with her.
In the past six years, the decades of thousands of families in Me'aca have been committed to crimes that were violated, and the new president promised to make this problem a priority during its government.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as the Governor," says Olver, the Congressman of Vale-de-Bravo from the PRI party.
However, most of this are threatened by the victims family in South Nes.
Bradley Manning has not been complained with a bad turn, he's accused.
The accusers are trying to comply with Bradley Maning's statements on the bad conditions of the content undertaken.
In the course of the hearing, Manining was highlighted in the military campaign in Quantico, the State of Virginia.
Protection is required to conclude that Maniang ' s conclusions were violent.
The United States Rival Army is accused of repairing a number of thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the accusation was trying to prove that a number of Bradley Manning, accused of the largest fleet of the sale materials in the United States history, did not comply with the Act of § to make a complaint for a bad treatment, which he, accordingly, had to be transferred in the military campaign.
During a recycling consultation in Fort Mide, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein, the records of the weekly visits of Manining's representatives of the administration within nine months of its content in Quantic, the State of Virginia, have no claim for bad treatment.
In the context of the investigation of the income of the defence of Maning, the fact that the conditions of his conclusion were cruel and itself was sufficiently punished, it was carried out on the day after Manning stated that he had been in place to commit self-mord.
A military expert on the analysis of information arrested in June 2010 is accused of defensing a number of thousand secret documents during the service of Iraq.
These materials were recently listed on WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During hearing on Friday, the prosecutor Phine and Maning reviewed the reports that were fulfilled after Maningh's visit during its residence in Quantico, where he was under the conditions of a close shutdown scheme from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the officers asked Maning and wrote his answers.
When the prosecutor Phine asked on the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he evaluated the treatment of the administration as "excellent" and the general terms of conclusions as "a very professionally organized".
The reports considered are not complained with bad treatment, despite that Maningh had directly asked about the conditions of its content, Fein approves.
Maning replied that he expressed the mouthfulness of these problems and that his visiting representatives of the administration discussed these problems with him and claimed that they would be concerned, but not in writing.
"They wrote "They have no problem" (after my complaint), but that doesn't mean that I didn't take this topic in conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Dennis Lind, also asked Manining why he did not complain about the irregularity of him in January 2011 during the meeting of the Commission, which had been discussed in writing in a number of months before.
Manning answered that during that meeting he wanted to get out of the "tree warning" regime and dismiss the conditions of conclusions.
The representatives of the military leader explained that the claimed regime is lower than the supervisory regime in order to prevent self-mord, was introduced to protect the prisoner and for the security of others.
"I wanted to tell the administration that it's all right with me to cancel the warning regime of grass... to improve my life level from my view," said Maning.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and translation to Kuwait, where it was contained nearly two months before they were transferred to the military sea base in Quantico, Virginia, July 2010.
He reported that the thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that once he lost a conscience because of a strong grief.
He explained that psychologically hard when they don't let you know how your participation is decided and what happens in the outer world.
"My world fell down to the CAP-Ariphjan base, to the sizes of my life," Maning said on Thursday.
- I'm going to die in this cell."
In Quentico, Maning, according to his statement, was a majority of time in a small camera - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours ago - in full unity.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a madras, a clothing, a slip, a few objects of clothes, and pockets.
He says he was trying to move, because it was prohibited to sleep or even to lie at the daily time.
Manining said, during his dream in his eyes, there was a light that went outside the camera.
If the guards had not seen him when he was turning into bed night, they, according to his words, were constructed and forced to turn to the bed.
The lawyer Manining gave an official opinion on the conduct of unlawful treatment with Maning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manining was transferred to military in Fort Levenworth, Canada.
Moreover, on Friday, the judge asked Maning of the statement that he had made during the witnessing on Thursday, that after one night he had been laid down to sleep in his camera in Quantico, he was urged to stand awake before protectors and other prisoners on the morning check.
Manning said he had no opportunity to cover the clothes during checking.
In response to the judge on Friday, Manning said that he realized that he had to leave the clothes that could be covered, but admitted that no one directly commanded him to leave him.
On Thursday, Manning stated that the last night he had been put to sleep for his trial to show the officer that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning reported what he told the officer that he could use the tissue or slips to traumatise himself, but he didn't do it.
On that night, according to Maningh's testimony, his below white, the slips and the eye took away from the camera.
His complaints hope that the judge will at least learn what he had to survive during the conclusion and will decrease the time of conclusion if Maning is recognized by a criminal court who should begin consideration of his case at the beginning of the year.
The Defence claimed that it was planning to propose Maning to recognize less serious crimes and other accusations to discharge as excessive.
The renewal of the hearings is planned for these outcomes, expecting that the complaint party will determine that the conditions of the contents were justified.
Pentagon claims that Manning was contained in Quantico with rules regulating the content of arrested with a maximum strike regime.
In the midst of the complaints of Maning, the complaint of the opponent, the illegal statement of data discovery on the Internet, the transmission of information on national defence, and the detention of public property or documents.
If he is convicted by all the items of the accusation, he may threaten the consequence.
My national self-determination crisis is the story of the American origin of Megan.
According to the author, many me-ends had to have to leave Me`a because of the lack of Property.
I am deceived to be guilty of those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that the American origins are disrupted between two cultures.
During the recent trip in Mexico, I passed through the corridor for the coming, approached the border control area and stopped.
The characters were indicated at two points: one for Mexicanos (meccans), second for extranjeros (foreigners).
I've been standing for a few seconds before them, without knowing where to go.
I grew up in California, and my life was called the Megan.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irelandians, and friends from New York are considered Italian.
Later, I stopped the complex "American of the Meccan origin".
But here I was in Meeka.
There was no need for my grandfather's family in terms or complex names.
I was just American.
I speak Spanishly good enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary reserve is poorer than the speakers, and I can't be released from the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport, and I've got it for extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the elected President Me'a'a Enrike Penny Neto visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda was used to meet the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
The President of Penja Neto said well about the summary of the Meccan economy, which means that the ends now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Me Méméka, rather than to move to the United States.
He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trade block like the Rose Union.
Furthermore, the President of Penny Neto promised to continue war against drugs in Meʹca, but no specific proposals were available.
For me, the issue of the United States is a serious and successful issue of old distress.
Most Americans have never thought that in 1848 the United States were entered into Meʹku, and their leaders were urged to refuse half their territory.
But the ends think about me for centuries, not for minutes, and see reminders of those events all over.
It is therefore necessary that only any State factor of the United States is to be mocked by the term of criticism in the part of Me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And Montesum's descendants are fulfilled by military.
In this case, I am the most complicated by me with more than 35 million Americans of the Meccan origin in the United States.
Do you want to talk about troubles?
They're enough.
There are winners and losers, people in this country for themselves, and those for whom they do not have.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people had so many of them only for one reason: at some time their family history was a father or a grandfather, who had no opportunity to go to Me Méméka and had to go north.
Most of these were the ends of a certain type - smuggling, small-formed, of poor Christian families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
It's different in Me Equake.
Today, our life is the inflation of American opinions, we learned in good schools and made good works, but we don't forget that even this is American, not mechanical.
Our national self-determination is not clear, but we know what country to consider it.
United States of America.
Moreover, we know that most representatives of the Meccan Elite and the Governing Class do not love us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating damage, and they refer to us as a second sort of people, as to the deceased ends of me.
We do not speak well in Spanish, and our relations with Metica is not sufficiently strong.
Only our discipline for them is explained by failures.
If our forefathers had succeeded in Me'a, they wouldn't go.
We wouldn't have been at this time after a throat that finds life in the United States, but lost spiritual connections.
My wife was born to Guadalahara and was still moved to the United States, and this reminds me that there are some trends between the Canaanites and the Americans -- the Mechakanians understand their national identity, and the Americans of Me Cana's origin it is harmful.
She is a United States citizen and thinks she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my known Americans of the Canadian origin do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We listen to the meccanical group of Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstin.
When you get the best of two worlds, you lose the roots unsecurely.
We're Americans in Mefelda.
And in the United States, we're called me-ends.
Now, as I have discovered during my train, as if our ability is not sufficiently indulgent, some of the Canadian leaders and representatives of the intellectuals want to restore the diaspore.
They want the Americans of the Meecan origin to work with the Me ́Ki and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our friends-American about what country it is and how well it is to be visited, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen contact with Metica.
Yeah, of course.
Don't finish anything.
Too much trial in the past.
In view of the disruption between the rich and the poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country as such.
Excuse me, but understand it yourself, amgos.
And that's right.
If the part of the Canadians until these pounds cannot forgive the United States how they did with Me ' s half centuries ago, they should also accept the fact that some Americans of the Me Canadian origin still have been in trouble of how recently they were associated with their families.
Yes.
Please, we have more general than I thought.
Old battles in the New Middle East
A agreement on the breaking of fire between Israel and Hammas grouping may be a major fund for further peace
Can long-term peace be between Arabs and Israel on the Middle East?
The specific area of blood proliferation is to conclude that such hopes are vital.
It sounds that are normal, uncertainly disappointed on who the first began; ­ the sentences were converted into ruin; murdered above 140 Palestinians, most of whom citizens were set up, and six Israel; first during the conflict issued from the region of Gaza’s rackets in the surroundings of the capital of Israel of Tel-Aviv and of Jerusalem’s holy city.
However, despite that Israel and Palestinians were unexpectedly involved in their extreme conflict, changes came to the Middle East.
This can be done differently, however, the events of the Arab wheel were circumcised in the wind storm, and the Palestinians and Israel were not able to remain in the wind of the region.
Their fight may be more bloodproliferable than before.
However, there are reasons that give hope for the outcome of this dupe.
War without winners
The first view of the situation does not give advice to optimism.
Even if the interruption of the fire, which was signed on 21 November, will be fulfilled, which only strengthened the positions of the forces on both sides in this week.
The leaders of the Islamist Motion Hamas, which came to the authority in the Gaza Sector in 2007, claim that they urged Israel to depart, despite their losses.
Despite some grouping leaders, and 1,7 million of people were locked in one of the most guest and difficult angles of our planet, Israel was not able to replace Hamas.
Hamas actually increases its population in the West River of Jordan, another Palestinian territory controlled by more moderate Fatch movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can completely conclude that the time is working on them.
As the increasing impact of islamist movements in the Arab world in Hamas appears new influences and rich friends.
The regenerating regional leader of Turkey, who was ever the nearest covenant of Israel among the Muslim countries, expressed support for Hamas; her example followed Katar, one of the richest and dynamic developments of the Persian village States.
Hamas's carriers declare the creation of the islamist half month around Israel, from Libanon to the north, in which the Hezboll military group is governed, to Syria, where the more islamist rebels are the power of Basher Assad, and more until Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatened by the Hamas's associates.
The most significant change in the strength balance in the region has occurred at the southern borders of Israel, in the most popular and important Arab country in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brother Motion was strengthened by President Muhammed Mursi.
Hossy Mubarak, who was ruled by Egypt for 30 years and had been in 2011, was a world dictator that did not give attention to the support of Hamas.
The Muslim brothers, rather, I am a organization, in many ways like Hamas, and their leaders are more arrogant to popularism.
In the future diplomatic divisions, Hamas may be a significant player whose voice will not be able to distort even Israel and America.
At the same time, the strangers in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hammas was thrown.
The Israeli Iron Cooling System has justified its creation and has successfully performed many of the Hamas rackets.
Citizens of Israel can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
As a result of diploma, the United States remained faithful to their unchanged position; many Peace countries also committed a victory for the beginning of the last victoria of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic improvement of Israel, especially by the Government of Benjamin Netanyah, which is a significant ignorant of peace process.
Despite the destruction of approximately 30 Israelites from 2004 from the rackets issued from the Gaza Sector, Israel has been able to bring to the minimum problem of terrorists, part of the wall that comes into the wall of the western river Jordan, a significant part of the Palestinian State, and protects Jewish residences that continue to be extended despite the illegality of such situations from the view of the international law of prosecution.
The position of the Prime Minister of Nathaniahu, whose Licud party, in the framework of preparation for elections intended on 22 January, has been associated with more aggressive conservators under the leading of Abigdor Liberman, is completely adequate.
What does it mean to build the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If they give their hands the whole authority in the West Âg territory, will they not begin to launch the rackets from there to Israel, how are they doing their collections in the Gaza sector?
It is better to keep them out of the wall, and to harder any effort to rise.
Perhaps the "great" lines will be won, but their accounts may be tested by the Arab magazine.
As islamists who come to the authority in Egypt and other countries experience not the warmest feelings of Israel, their priority will become internal problems.
The part of Israel ' s budget is more than all its Arab neighbours taken together.
The association of wars with regional overseers will help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen their own economy.
The practice of the President of Egypt, Mursy, who worked together with Barack Obama over fire breaks, is a good sign and may be marked by the beginning of changes.
Israel, not less, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As democratic changes in Arab countries, the abstention of Palestinian rights to self-determination represents a bomb of immediate action that will be soon or lately exploded on the occupied territories of Israel, such as the bus in Tel-Avive in this week.
Repressions already support the foundations of the democracy in the Hebrew State, and the demographic and the growth of the Arabian population is only to ruin these problems.
The blood-proliferant operations carried out each year in the Gaza Sector's territory for reducing the Hamas movement must be held to the deficiency of the international community.
Both parties need outside impulse
There is only one decision to which healthy representatives of both sides and most of the island peace and our newspaper are calling for: education of two states and intervention of the Israeli territory in exchange for security.
There is a hope that it is not too impressive in a short-term perpetuation - the hope that the stop of fire will allow other countries to affect the sides of conflict.
Egypt, whose time is to decide to overcome the weapons in the Gaza sector, as well as Turkey and Katar, have a positive position in order to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Hebrew State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also strive to reconciliate Hamas and Fatch movements.
This would make more for the establishment of a Palestinian State than for the future vote in the United Nations, which could be recognised by the Palestinian Virtual State.
His role is to put Israel on the table of negotiations should also play President Obama.
During his first time, he did not have a plan for peace resolution.
After returning to the White House, he continues to demonstrate the desirableness of joining the solution of this problem.
It's a catastrophic invisible position.
The United States are livingly interested in the stability of the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of peaceful agreement between Israel and Palestinians.
Australia entered into force the law on the unified packaging for cigarettes.
The warnings on the fum and the damaged diseases of the body are contraryly assigned to the low green boxes, equal to all cigarettes.
The first in the World Procurement of the Australian Law on the single packaging of cigarettes and tabacco products entered into force by replaceing logotes and coloring different olive boxes with the same color of olive box with the painful pictures of the body and children of the diseases of their parents.
Besides the various images and signatures that warn about the fucking, the only difference between the packets entered in the obligation of this subboth is the name of the marrows that are printed by the same small font.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for the forming of the packaging of tabacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the goal of this measure is to maintain a young person from fuming by leaving this moderate habit.
On the basis of this decision, the results of the investigation showed that people who have not started to smoke up to 26 years, in 99 cases of 100, never become sorcerers.
"Obviously, even in the age of children understand the meaning that they are trying to bring tabacco companies in the form of packaging," explains the Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek, based on research that, for example, the crown in the logope is associated with children with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the smallest countries in the world, so these changes will not be made to reach transnational corporations, but the possibility of taking such measures is already considered by other countries.
The representatives of the Tabacco industry were increasingly opposed to the adoption of this law.
Tabacco firms claim that this will only increase the part of the black market on which raw and available cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will lead to serious consequences other than those who have thought of his initiatives," says Scott Macinther, representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Manufacturers of China and Indonesia will provide much more such goods to sell in Australia.
Instead, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha from a small family company of Zico Import Pty Ltd states that the question on ports and silicon footballs that hide the inappropriate images on the packaging, has been intensely grown (approximately from zero) from those couples as two months ago, such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, where they were trying to blame this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already been assigned to six thousand public trade undertakings and expects a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential mixture for the efficiency of such measures is, as experts consider, the popularity of networks between the part of the population to which these measures are addressed.
After adopting a number of laws in Australia, the illegal television advertising and support of their activities, as well as the sellers prohibited to make cigarettes visible, the tabacco reklame moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has prohibited companies and websites to place an advertising on the Internet, but it can't provide free websites.
"If you handle tabacco products and you have only this small laze, the idea of moveing your goods on the Internet will show you a very deceitful," explains Becky Friman, who investigates the issues of public health at the Sidney University.
The company notes the increase in the number of reviews on trade marks written by → as usual users in such networks as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is: is this really the case of a raw citizen who loves the cigarettes of Marlboro so much that he has disappointed the strength and time and made a video roof, or is that a reclaiming company?
The Australian company British American Tobacco states that adults are now more adapted to new rules than advertising.
The representatives of the Tabacco industry have even made measures such as the sponsory of Ukraine, Honguras and the Dominican Republic to promote new rules: these States provide claims under the World Trade Organization, stateing that trade has been undergone injustices, despite the fact that trade in all these countries with Australia is fully unsignificant.
The WTO decision is expected at the middle of 2013.
According to Tany Plibersek, the Government discussed the opportunity to adopt similar package laws with other countries.
In 2001, Canada was the first commitment to the position of the graphs warning about the fucking.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including in Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of lacking is considered in Greece, New Zealand, UNAR and India.
Many cows in Australia are not demonstratively obedient to new information.
These pictures didn't hurt me.
I just don't care.
"You just catch the cigarette and hide the pocket in the carmen," explains Victor El Hagg, buying cigarettes with the graphy of the mouth field on the bottle.
Honestly, the only thing that can cause me to leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, a carrier of the King of the Pack in Sidney's centre, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of distribution of goods on the pool
"I've had an hour for the new party, and now four hours," he regrets.
"It was supposed to take and prohibit the cigarettes, then we would say, "What are you doing, okay, everything is finished, closing the magazine," he says, "which hands are on the top.
In the world of electronic networks and constant connections, it is not so bad and bad.
This day of appreciation, I had to take five hours in the airport because our airport was discovered and replaced it with another aircraft that we had expected.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of socks.
I'm not going to lied you.
Paul's airport in expectation of travel is really nice, and there will not be much help for any books, magazines, iPhone, even free trade stores.
However, in recent times, more scientists and experts in the development have been reported to the benefit of shock.
They say that in certain situations, we and our children are not so bad and bad.
This requires the brain to take place on interesting thresholds that may contribute to creation.
And since we are all in the present world in front of any screen, the advantages of shock are over us.
Maybe we need to try to get a shock?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll get back to this.
Before I, like many, believed that the sorrow was the exciting of recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, Peter Tui, professor of the Greek and Roman History of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book "Urtract History of Shoki" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale ́ Press, 2011).
"In reality, the crazy can have a very old story," he says.
On the walls in Pompeah, latin records on the suck dated for the first century have been found.
There is a open question of how we understand shaking.
The problem is, says John D. Istud, a professor of the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of shock were often changed.
By studying the materials of the study on this subject and addressing the target group to 100 persons, Professor Istud and his colleagues came to the definition of: the shock is when people are "but they can't be able to do what would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between shaking and apatia, he says, is that a crazy man doesn't do anything he wants to do.
You don't want to do anything in apatia.
The basic in anxiety shock, he says, is "the disturbance of attention and the disturbance of the adversity and the feeling of the time is slow."
The depression may be very similar to the depression described by the shadow.
Professor Istud, however, states that despite the relationship between these situations, awaiting people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and those who are concerned with depression face problems in themselves.
Sometimes we're going to do what we're worried when we're really difficult to focus on something.
In its study, "Independent §: the definition of sucking from the point of attention", reported in the September issue of the Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Istud and colleagues are on an earlier experiment, whose participants listened to the vote record of the reading magazine.
Some participants also heard the sounds that were not related to the TV programme included in the neighborhood, others heard the same sounds on the lower volume, so their food could be discovered, and the third group only listened to the voice record without a external sound track.
Those participants who heard the television with a low volume level noted that they were worried, often others -- they were difficult to focus, but they didn't know the reasons that they were and put it up.
When we are trying to conclude the difficult or disturb the task, the interruption of attention may cause a shock, Mark J. Fenska, an advocate of neurologia at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this investigation.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteressable, "for example, looking at the stream of products on the conveyor in seeking a marriage, the distracting may help to escape the shock."
It seems that when people start moving on the chair or drawing the rubbers on the paper, they do it from the shock, but now we know that these actions are actually helping to do so physically.
"The investigation showed that children who do not prohibit to disturb and turn, learn better and remember more information than children who need to sit quietly," says Professor Fenske.
At some time, we're all trying to be sorrowed: when the journey (as in my case), listening to the monotonal movie, looking on an uninteressed movie.
However, different people demonstrate a different degree of devotion to shock.
In the 1980 ’ s, researchers have developed a special " scale of decline to shock" for the measurement of such individual characteristics.
For the definition of this scale, questions and questions are used, for example, "A lot of what I have to do, equally and monotonally" or "I have too much interest in it, so there's no time enough."
By means of such a questionnaire, researchers have determined that the boys were more often a girl, " says Steven Wodanovich, professor of psychology at the West Florida University, especially in the case of different external distressers.
However, in the total growth often has a choice.
In 1991, Rid Larson, Professor of Personal and Public Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he was associated with a pioneer with nearly 400 growth and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the results: 32 per cent of adults claimed that they were sorrowly at school and during their home task, and 23 per cent claimed that they were sorrowful at school levels.
Only 3 per cent of parents have noticed that they are sorrowful.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data about the data of the socket now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "in adult age is a pick of decline to shock", especially because the growth and growth are not allowed to decide in full way than to take.
Let's go back to my first question: is it useful?
Sometimes, because in the final evidence, it, as investigations, can lead people to absurd and dangerous physical action, risk-asarted games or misuse of certain things in trying to escape.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between shadow and creation, says Professor Wodanovicz, who dedicated the study of this problem over two decades.
"So our brain suggests us that we should take something else; that's a shock," says Gerry Markus, professor of psychology at the New York University.
But this most brain doesn't always know what it's better to do.
If you'll be nice and you'll make this energy to the gitarr game or culinary experiences, you'll make yourself better.
But if you're looking at the TV, you'll be better just for a while, and soon it's going to be.
Therefore, if your child is sorrowing and you give him iPad, he'll stop to be sorrowed, but he's not going to learn to act with a sweet self-essential or any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
"And such habits of self-regulation are involved in the most different situations," he states.
Your child is not just learning to do anything self-control, but he also learns self-control.
I don't think the shock needs to carry out something.
However, it doesn't be worth thinking of something bad.
We should soon learn to feel comfortable even outside the uninterrupted flow and technology.
Professor Istud is with this.
"We see this so that we must often test the crazy, while the sorrow is an extremely uncomfortable, irrelevant desire to take something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to disappear from persistent forgets and simply disgrace.
"In the present world we have used to constantly stimulate the emotional organs," he says, "and when the silence is, we are lost and we don't know what to do."
Until it is unintelligible how the new law on marihuanaisising will be applied in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a ninety-year-old football team player and a student of the public college in the south-east state of Colorado, is accused of covering a voting crime that is concluded that it will soon be legally in all the state's territory: maintaining a small port of the marihuana and the tubes in which he smoke it.
Mr. Orosco says that on September he and his friends were in Lamare and went to the car for a prery near the border with Kansas when the police were stopped.
After detecting the police in the Marihuan car, Mr. Orosco came to the court for drug protection and the property for drug use - a small rights for each of which the rates are estimated for 100 dollars - and the date of the sentence was appointed.
"We're acting like criminals," says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the indetermination that has been continued a few weeks after the state of Colorado has voted for the use of marihuana in small quantities to resolve, the decision of hundreds of small courts is not so depending on the law as far as the place of consideration.
The accusations of small laws with marihuana are already recorded in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, which adopted an analogue measure.
Police partyes have already stopped to complain people at age 21 and older for the preservation of small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law will enter into force within a few weeks.
However, in the more conservative areas, the Colorado's accusers decided to consider the cases of marihuana and still attached to the responsibility for the preservation of this drug.
At the same time, in some towns, from Denver to the mountains of West, they vote for not allowing new, licensed marketing states on the sale of marijuana.
"All this grows so stretchly that I don't even know what to wait further," says Daniel J. Outs, the police head of the city of Abora, on the east of Denver.
The representatives of the control authorities in Washington are also deeply honored.
They should provide rules for the definition of the licence for growth, distribution, and sales of marijuana, and it must be done until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, well or bad, is concerned with the majority of other states to resolve the matters of use of marijuana, sleeping for medical purposes and now to discuss.
"In Colorado, a more harmonised market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Committee on Production Management and Alcohol Production in Washington.
But now no one can do more, Mr Smith is recognizing than to make any proposals and hope that this will be done.
"We don't have a real precedent to orient," he says.
The legislation of the state of Washington, named I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will take the State into force for the whole year when the public licence system is not yet, and the right to possess the marihuana is already legal.
Although there are more simple techniques that must be decided during this period, for example, how to find the equality between the "adequate access" state to the licensed marijuana with the prohibition of trade by 1000 feet from school, parking, game areas and gardens.
"In particular, it will be difficult to place licensed undertakings on marihuana trade in the cities, in particular in Sietle and its premises," explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the recently created investigation group of the "Center of Marihuanaalisation".
On 21 November, the police officer of Outs from Abora sent his submitted report that the town's prosecution would no longer be attached to the 21-year-old persons to the responsibility for the possession of a small number of marihuanas, and that the police stops the number of people in the data of "the beginning of this time".
The police leader of Outs reported that the police would follow the monitoring of the rules in the town regulating the activities of persons in the medical purposes and will persecute illegal traffickers and drug distributors.
The prosecutor of Wald in the north Colorado, Ken Bak, represents a stronger approach to this issue.
After voting on the legislative project, he stated that the procurement would continue to attach the responsibility for the possession of the marihuana, mainly in order to encourage the users to take the treatment course.
At this point, the 119th issues were claimed to hold two and less unities of marihuana, although many of them were accused of other offences.
"The obligation of our institution is to pursue action that are considered criminal at the time of their consensus," said Mr. Back in his statement.
The reaction was unlikely even in the areas such as the rural area, where the voting participants rejected the proposal for marihuana-approving.
The Grand Janxh police, the largest city in the surrounding city, are no longer attracted to the responsibility of the full-years for the possession of a small quantity of drugs.
The surrounding prosecutor Peter Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take account of the already open cases of marihuana.
"I think to ensure the compliance of the law before it changes, our primary responsibility," he says.
Despite 55 per cent of the people of Colorado, participating in the vote, they supported this decision, including the issues of the use of the marihuana to address the public and legal system would not be easy.
In contrast, the reaction of people in different states was inequality by the authorities to the experiment of the state with the marihuana.
"The Cultural Barrier is in the area of the prosecutors," explains Shawn'alister, danverian, who represents the interests of the marihuana preserved, and the representative of the National Organization of Reforming of Marihuana laws.
"They are so long persecuted by people because they are not able to be quiet now with the fact that it is not a crime anymore," he says.
Colorado and Washington are the first states in which a small number of marihuanas are related to the same as the alcohol is determined to be a experimental field in the country's scale to check the idea of drugs.
Parties of distribution and official states are planning to expand the territory of trade, but they are in danger of the federal authorities who are still planning to consider the sale and development of marihuana as a federal crime.
Parties of marijuana's distribution hope that the Office of Justice will take place in this matter.
Despite a number of, the Federal Government received a wide range of trade and patients arrests, using the marihuana in medical witnesses, most of the cases the Federal Government gave good trade in the Medical purposes of Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agencies for drug fighting will have to be able to enter into the house to confiscate a small marihuana package, but their food will be closed to the regulated authorities of the restructuring market, allowed under the new law, considers Kevin A. Sabet, an ex-consequent adviser for drugs in the Administration of Obama.
The city's position in Colorado was not expected by the federal authorities.
Before the presidential elections, some of the competent administrations have approved the morals for the opening of new marijuana sales stores that would not be able to open before a year.
In the last week, Montrose, the city in the west part of the state, made a six-month prohibition on marihuana trade, which, of course, will be approved at a week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we will issue a license to someone, and then it will cause serious problems at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, member of the city Council.
Our city spoke against this amendment.
And now we have an opposite between the results of voting and what the state has voted.
There are many more unresolved issues.
Petronella White: I was survived from Oxford because I was a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views has not been started today.
As long as I remember, I always wanted to go to the Oxford University.
My father and the elderly brother learned in Oxford and described it as the best educational training in the world, the modern analogue of an anti-simpose, based on two bases of civilization, freedom and patience.
However, after two weeks of learning at the historical college of Wooster of the University of Oxford at the end of the eighth century, I collected chemodeanas and went out that was the first real scandal in my life.
My father didn't stand and wept.
The friends were shot from so much.
The Evening Standard claimed that I left the college because I didn't like my companions to be sexed in the neighborhood.
A. Norman Wilson shot that I was gone because I had to drink out of the kidneys.
Actually, it wasn't so funny.
I'm gone.
Yeah, she was running because I was systematicly scared and scared.
Not totally because of my adequate name or what I learned in my private school.
Only for one reason, and in this glorious holiday of ability, this looked like a warfare and a blind fanateism: my father, now the rest of Woodro White, was a council of Margaret Tetcher, and I was the foreigner of the conservators.
You're wondering why to mention this now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students maintaining the rights of the views is the same.
This institutionalised and continuing hatred to the conservators in Oxford is so much that a group of these students needed the same protection of their rights in the last week as those who are granted to minorities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservators from the Student Club of Corpus Christy in Cambridge state that they "freely are actively isolated, subjected to individual attacks and caused themselves to feel unnecessary guests" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative in the Committee on the Rights of the College to ensure the freedom of expressing their opinion.
Their situation has only been destroyed by the recent BBC 2 documents on the Strana Mysteries: Young, smart and right, in which conservers have been exacerbated by neonacists and neonacists.
The film was shown by Joe Kuck, the former president of the Conservative Association of the Oxford University, who is in the Rolls Royes, carrying silver coast and silver coast.
In other universities, conserving students are complained that they are doing "the losses of exemption because of the increase of learning".
Luke Blake, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Conservative Association of Notytingham University, said, "In the University Environment, the overcome is increased by the left views.
People who don't even know us earlier believe that we are a lonely and unleavened children of rich parents."
With Roberts, 21 years old, a student of the historical college Corpus Christie, in which a request was given for protection efforts, calls such an atmosphere "inconscient" and Stephanie Cheryl, 19 years old, the new president of the Conservative Association of Oxford University, says that the relations of members of the student club to the rights of views have been significantly disappointed.
"This is a threat to the atmosphere of the intellectual debate and simply for the normal life of the Club members," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just at least, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, with a work and an eighty-eighty-year-year-old work.
Oxford was free from hate to the conservative party.
In a year before that, the University left the former student Margaret Tetcher its earlier degree due to reduction in budgetary assets to higher education.
That atmosphere would be uncomfortable even stalinists.
In the first days of the first week, when students met each other and teachers, I first felt that I was waiting forward.
I didn't even know that teachers were not just looking through the fingerprints on the trail of the conservers, but also enjoying it.
Political issues are the deterioration of shakeers, privatisation and non-governmental sanctions against the State of Apartment in the UNAR - have passed through the broad-tree panels of the auditor wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the 18th century to English, and I was not ready to follow it.
"Mrs. White," said the teacher, now the rest of Harry Pi, please translate the first paragraph."
The text was given to me with hardness, and I was cut off.
Harry Pi was a very yellow man with a face like a torture.
"Thatchrists are principlely not teaching French, or they simply do not have enough brain?" he asked.
Other students were protected.
I've got the laughs in my eyes.
"I welcome you to take a few early French lessons in a free time, if you are not very busy when returning to the community," broke Pi.
I'm back to my comma totally unfortunate.
That evening in the coldge, I was sitting behind the two, and then somebody shot me on the cow.
It was James, a second course student from the English student, who was a member of the University Conservator Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the matter is a way:
On everyone who understood the sympathetics to the conservers, they will be thrown.
I'm not easy, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Tetcher, so you'll be more complicated.
Most primary conservators believe that they are libraries."
Later, in the pabe, I tried to lime.
I insisted that `na was not with all that Margaret Tetcher says.
Hitness failed.
The primary college of philosphia, politics and economy, who learned in Iton, said, "You're a daughter of a fascist swine.
You're inactive."
Other students accepted his words.
I was excited, disgusting.
"How do the conservers act in sex?", asked one of them.
- They're kidding each other, right?"
I felt like the homosexualists had to feel before the abrogation of the voting persecution in the sixty years.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or would I have to meet the one-dinkers just under the clothes of the night?
Should I be obliged to be a leaborist and hide my real convictions?
Three years ago, I had been seen as a dog, a full persecution, and a singleness.
The only teacher in my college, who didn't hide his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for the belonging to the conservators, but also because he was the Tetcher adviser on external policy and one of its partners.
He wasn't actually in the coldge.
He prejudiced him for the provincy, lack of mildness and commitment to the history's historical view.
In 1997, he adopted a professional position at the Bilkent University in Ancarre, Turkey.
"You're not happy here," he said to me.
I started to go out to Oxford from the parents' house in London, trying to find a refuge between families and unprecedented staff friends.
I told Dad that I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
All political views were taken there during his learning in the fourty years.
"But this is the best university in the world," he claimed.
- It's not able to do that, but not in the town of the wooden spies...
Even my friends-communicators always say itself without prejudice."
His weapons were thrown down.
"Do not make successful decisions.
I'm sure it's just crazy.
You'll break my heart if you're leaving the university."
I was disappointed by continuous streets in London and my emotional protection.
My friend, as well as the conservator, did not have pressures and refused to reject his victories.
In the weekend, during the seminar, when the classic teacher of the story called me "the voice of the people", I decided to do the same.
In the soul of a fool from a shame, I admitted that "I had a brain of my parents" and called them "an old fools."
The fuck was a little long.
The last wheel in my carrier's sepulchre in Oxford was determined to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote for two weeks for issues belonging to Rupert Merdoque every week.
My door was closed.
I didn't go out, and after five minutes, my persecutors went out.
When they went, I gathered the cow and sat on the first road to London.
I didn't come back.
You can call me a plastic and a piece.
But in the eighteen years, no one should be the subject of such wickedness and anxiety in education.
Moreover, it was Oxford, who has not only released fourteen premiers of the second, but is also hidden in this day for the unleavened reputation of the university, in which the ability and freedom are appreciated.
"Valentino prefers the electedness of glory"
The "Valentino: Shitja Master" that was opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Phony Tissen-Bornemica and other Italian designer clients
Somercet-house, the former residence of the English Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital worth accepting a statement of Valentino Garabani.
The designer recognised this during the opening of "Valentino: Shitja Master", a triumphal retro, which units more than 130 high-mode loans created by his "house" during the last 50 years.
"I love this court," he says with his imperfect Italian accent.
This exhibition is a final part of the history, the only person of which is "il Sinore" Garabani, but it could not be written without his named clients.
Valentino always felt a rare and remote knowledge of the world.
In the first quarter of this exhibition, opened until 3 March, they collected different letters and writings by signing the most valuable aristocrats from the princess of Salima Aga-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of the United Kingdom.
Valentino shows these different memories as the trophes of its sum: from a small port from the city of Voger north of Italy to the international "Elite" cumer.
It doesn't matter to be loved in the king's court.
"They almost don't cut their cigarettes on your wonderful cover, as some pop-music stars do," says the Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemic.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in Alpha and were good friends.
Valentino is an unlike master and accepts guests with kindness and election.
"We all liked to come to his hall in Gstaad," explains the former wife "Hainey" Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beautifuls like Marellly Anielly, or a genius Ni
Valentino always prefered the electedness of glory.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representative of Valentino
The Argentin Model Valeria Mansa recalls the charity of the model.
Once we went to eat to him home, it was after showing mode in Spain, a lot of years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy the youngest.
Valentino's style was shown in every detail of his apartment, in her detention, in food, in Property.
"Each of Valentino's guests had been given to feel important and favorite," recalls the "to-model" work started with the model in 1995 during the High Mode Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of the mode, because his exhibitions are real experiences," she ends.
Rotational Parent
Garabani's life is a story of not obtainability, but loved with full mutuality.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somercet-house gallery was converted into a glomoral width of sixty metres in length that makes a change of role: the visitor takes a place of models and must defilate on the suburb, the "speakers" container of the grass, which swimming by the heads of Valentine, such as the payment that Jaclin Kennedy chose for his marriage with Aristoteles Onossis, the bone of Monica Witty in the "Night", or a palette of the skin and the skin that belonged to the Fara Diba Empertice.
The names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn un Taxis, Matte-Marith from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sophia Gabsburg.
Nati Abascal and Modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, "not forget."
I'll remember him.
These were the rocks, the rubber, the "gilet" and the jackets from the 1971-1972 eight winter collection.
"This was the gift he made to me," says Nati Abascal, one of the designer museums.
"I prefer him to the rest of his female, for his great love for women, because he highlights the beauty," adds the former Hercegine de Feria.
I like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they "come" to his face.
Proportions are perfect.
The princess and lawman of Patricia's modality did Jovampaola Dr. Arenberg can not forget the first time she was clothing in Valentino.
When I was growing up and lived in Italy, I thought I had an age and a choice to put one of his dinner toilets...
The end came that hour at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first wage from Valentino to put it on the feast in the lock of my cousin, Prince Edward de Line.
It was a red wheel, with a wheel with a wheel, a "cursage" in a stone and a wheel without a wheel.
"This was a dream that appears," says Rodrigo's widow d'Arenberg.
"Valentine is equal to mode, his ability is temporary," explains this Italian aristocratic, living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d'Arenberg keeps his celebrations from the model with "maximum caution... because the payment is not just a payment, but also a total of memories that follow him."
Mode King
The great end of the exhibition in Somercet-house is Marie-Santal Miller for her wedding with Paul from Greece in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "children" (that is called the modeler of its Swiss) were required to produce this set from the color of the slone bone with the inkrustation of the wheat, the twelve species of different circles and sleep at four and half meters.
According to the journalist Susie Manques, the largest authority of specialized pressure, the payment is a very high mode of end of the 20th century, "the return of clients from the highlight."
Valentino is now its best representative for many years of the "life style" of the elite.
Cavaler of the Great Cross (the distinction of the highest ranga in Italy), the Cavaler of work, the Commander of Experience and Divinity ordered by the Order of the Holy One, Garabani collected the same honor as any of his customers' husbands.
"My attention always touched his tenderness, his calmness, his accurate and inappropriate outer look," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
Last time, I saw him a month ago at a dinner in the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Jacklin de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was unusual, there is no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The world's weakest profession: Kawah-Idjan Shachters
Four of the Indonesian shakers risk life and health, taking 70 kilograms of serums to the top of the wh.
There are people for whom their work is ad, and others are literally working in the sand.
Among them, Anto Vigiay, one of the 400 shahters who work for life in the Kawah-Idgen, situated on the east of the Indonesian island of Jawa.
Each day, Anto descends on the bottom of the crater, where the silver gas that rises from the depth of the Earth is in contact with the air.
It puts them into two bamboes, splits the wheels on the bottles and carries them on the surface of the road.
To the top of the wu, the height of 2.386 metres is only 250 metres, but the whispers are required for more than 40 minutes to rise up in a faster step, maintaining the equality and the rest of the road so that they do not fall out of the surface.
They know that one unfailed step could have their lives, as it happened to one tourist from France, who was broken a few years ago from the Kawah-Idjan scale.
Kawah-Idjan's chatters win 5 per kilogram of serum covering
On the top, they make their way between tourists who graphize them, as if they were circled by the circles, and the height of the worst wheels have passed three kilometers to the wheels that the cross-border company has laid up at the top of 1,850 metres.
The PT Candy Ngrimby, the undertaking that has exploited this vulcan since 1960 and, better and not to say, its responsibility to 662 Indonesian Rupees (5%) for each kilogram of serum.
Then it sold it for 100,000 rupes (83%) to petrochemical productions, since this mineral is distributed in the entire life and is used to produce sockets, feedbacks, cosmetics, dynamites and even sacharises.
"So as the normal is the 70 kg transfer, we work about 46,000 rupses (3,8%) for each road," explains Anto, which usually performs three daily transfers.
He's spent three hours for each of them and finally feels disrupted, but they allow him to buy 138.000 rubbers (11.5/10) to the end of the day.
Although this is a missionary for such non-eventual efforts, it is more than three years he would have worked in the field.
"The underground payment to the shockers is very high in the case of coffee, where 15,000 rupses are collected on the day and in the middle of the month for two million rupses (1677/7)," explains the cartridge that had previously worked a stone on the Bali Island.
There his payment was 75.000 rupies (6.2.2) on the day and part, but Anto returned with his family to Banguang, a city nearby from Wow, for the reason that in Indonesia is the same coincidence as the seara: "I married Bali, where some Indians were, and brought her to Java, so that she would be sent to it."
Anto astma, he's breathing with hardness, keeping agitating, and he's got the eyes down because of the gases.
In its 27 years, Anto had three years of risk in Kawak-Idjan, which had already been reported on it despite the mask and special points.
He has a astma, he breathes with hardness, keeps slow, and he has the eyes down because of the gases that make a vulcan.
It's the price he should pay for the achievement of his mind.
"I'm still two years old because I want to open or study Spanish or French," he promises more than the English acceptable.
A penalty of life, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist, officer, or potter in the hotel, but instead he performs mula.
By dividing the wooden woods with other weapons, it stands every day at two hours of night, because the serum does not stop running the night when its natural yellow color turns into a bully and flashes between darkness.
Anto is going down to the crater, and he is selling himself a small fountain, subcombined to his bag, which he himself bought for his money.
Approximately 400 cartridges tattoo the cartridges with grid on their bottles with a bunch of wu
Despite the high arrival, the bovine company does not have a mechanism for the acquisition of serums for the economy and does not provide any equipment to the mediators who work for their account and with such detentions.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of 300,000 rupses (2.5%) of the collection of a salaries, which, in addition to the income ticket of 15.000 rupes (1.2.2), the protectors of the commander take from tourists coming to photograph the Vulcan and his people.
"This work for animals, not for humans," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old core carrier, who has been conducted at Kawah-Idjan for three decades, from the way the college has left.
The sp up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will endure “as much as he can” because he needs money for the education of his three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to the pension, I'm gonna die here because the vulcan is my whole life.
Although the wind burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind immediately changes and captures the winds in the fleshly rows out of the wheat, they are so exciting that no one regrets its harder diseases... more serious, obviously, than their normal problems with respiration, arthrosis, pains in the knees and wounds that were deformed under the heat of the corsine.
With the balance of the crash on the bridge, Uninic can now only rise 50 kilograms into 53 years.
Each day, he and his companions take 15 tonnes of serums from the wow, which three carriers carry up to the stock to Thamansar, over 18 miles [18 km] from the floor in the middle of adults.
"I'm not going to the pension, I'm gonna die here, because the vulcan is my whole life," Uninic says, opening the mouth, which doesn't suffice for several teeth.
From his five children, the elder, 30 years, also works as a serum transfer.
The time is going, but the poverty always grows from a generation of one of the most difficult jobs in the world: what the Kawah-Idjan molecules are doing.
Singapore seeks children to save the economy
Singapores are accused of career, stress, and prices on yellow and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriot husband, you're my wife of patriot, we're going to make our civil society and create life!
It may be amazing that these lines are part of the reklame of milk boxes, but, despite that, or maybe, this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are the part of the repa that uses the talks like "Let's put the bao (bowling) in the pen" to smile over the level of birthability in Singapore.
The public agency, which made this video, BBH, has hoped that they would be able to take into account the problem in the form of the advertising.
His Creator Director, Duglas Gamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of the people to perform "they national".
This thing was exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to play like ourselves, so we feel that this is the subject we need to take.
We knew that the Government was trying to do many things, such as to acquire spirits with pheromons or to organize the festivals of quick knowledge (bliz witnesses).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they have unnecessaryly joined.
So we thought why we should not do the most creative thing of the → to solve this problem, namely to create a rep?
1.2 Child
Whoever doesn't assume that so easy, this is the Government of Singapore.
It takes $1.300 per year for a policy for the education of citizens for the birth of a larger number of children.
The State package for marriage couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars for a child, extends the debt payment and generations and provides tax debt.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-technological state in South-Eastern Asia, a conservative of its leadership and a strong public control.
The level of birthability in Singapore, which is its national population management, is currently 1,2 children per woman.
The last time he was below 2 - it was a percentage of replacement in 1976.
So why don't the syngapores have more children?
Tan Way Min, Director of the Policy Department on Marriage and Family of the National Government of the Population, says that the cause of "building education" and "the greatest karrier gamma".
"This has allowed people to have a larger gamma of options in the case of life's objectives and priorities, besides the marriage and the creation of a family," she explains.
These changes of the rules contribute to the increase in the number of holossians and the discharge of marriages and children's birth, which reduced birthability levels in Singapore.
However, the immigration policy aimed at enhanced immigration in order to resist the decreasing of the population is a challenge between the population.
In Singapore, there are web sites where the food of hidden xenophobia is flowing for many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who criticize the support of loans at low level and demand to be integrated.
The immigration growth is also considered one of the reasons that the Governing Party of Singapore has received the worst result in elections from independence.
After elections, it was attempting to resolve the problem, using the quota and higher taxes for foreign slaves.
Unexpected consequences
While birthability is a significant impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax income, medical and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also begins to have some unexpected effects.
The Government takes efforts to not build such a small greenhouse.
For example, this began to affect the inmobility sector.
Ru for urban development has passed to the control of the number of small apartments as a "building box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are very well sold by 46 square metres.
Yet, there is a view that they can contribute to a cold lifetime and only stimulate those who want to build a large family village.
But Lim Yu Sun, Director-General of the EL's household firm, says that their "country boxes" are selling much faster than space boxes.
They are more popular, in the meaning that these apartments are spent for a few days, even a week, faster than the apartments of greater size.
As a result, our daily income is increased.
However, he recognises that new standards provide more clear orientations for the employees that had previously suggested if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city of government.
Although these new rules may be a step to enhance national birthability, after the syngapores working in the financial quarter of the centre, they will not have any effect.
"The people are very stressed, dear, as well as education, and that is why many people reject it," says the young manager.
Others may have children.
"But it is important for me to have his own money and time," says another young man 20 years.
Man and women mention their career, stress and prices on yellow and education as reasons for their children.
So, as the Government tried to encourage his citizens to be born to children, the last word remains behind the Singapores.
Personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the King's Academia of Spanish, the speech and the characteristics of the privacy or the " privacy area that they have the right to protect from any involvement".
What is different for non-completely 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in the networks?
Does he understand the dangers of discussing the Internet situations that would not have been divided outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five guys from 10 to 15 years of age, part of the network users.
In four cases, they associated the term with " something very myself" in personal area and "password and username" when it was applied to networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't have loaded in post," says decade Horhe, when he's trying to explain the importance of personality on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been recorded for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
In the FB, I'm threatening beautiful pictures or pictures from the game.
I'm also distressing with my familiars.
"I wouldn't share a graphy that is not mine, or someone who is stupid," he says.
The boy knows that it is wrong to put the inappropriate graphics of people who have been deceived, crimes, or to write about a serious comment.
Horke assured that he knows 35 friends in the FBI, and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are family members.
Mother in the course, she has a password for one of the accounts.
I commanded Twitter to express myself and to write interesting moves.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just threatening them," he adds.
"Society of the network is a divorce, I can talk to remote families or to my friends quickly," he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
It would not be considered with someone who would recommend him to be a stranger.
The 14-year-old Hose is different.
This growth has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the last time it recognises that 20 people do not know in his list of friends.
"This doesn't scare me because we have something common, for example," he says.
The boy said that no one had confidence in him or requested his home address or phone number.
"If I'm able to give or require, I'll just remove them from my accounting account," he admits.
Hose`s follower Ask after reading a recommendation to Twitter.
The boy doesn't have a surprise of what it's like a kibermobing today.
One of my known friends is a chance in a network.
He was threatened and required money.
"He didn't know who he was," he assured.
The Geertva, according to Hose, did not remove the accounting record.
"It's only involved confidentiality."
He then explains the impact of the steps to set up the accounts safely.
In contrast to Horhe, this boy would have loaded the graphics of those known in inappropriate or confusion situations.
Yeah, I would have done this if a man doesn't like me or if I want it.
"I want to know that this is a cybermobing," he confirms.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, the teacher of English and the teacher of education and training specialist, believes that to guide children and adults, it is necessary to understand that the objectives of networks are to be informed.
"The Internet appeared as a means to search for information, but these sites changed the rules of games," she noted.
Porras indicates that Mark Prenski, a pedagogic master of the Yeel University and the work author of the Digital Aborigens and Immigrants, has taken these terms for the explanation of this phenomenon.
Digital aborigens are they, children and youths who were born in the technology.
"We are digital immigrants to teach them while we are still learning ourselves," she says.
It explains that this subject is complicated, "for we ask them to have a certain criteria of what you can or -- to spread, to say, when adults are not enough for it."
"So that they may be electoral, while most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show that it is confidentiality to the growth, is to ask questions that cause them to think.
"Tell them that they don't do that, devil," she adds.
Then Porras recalculates some options: there are things you wouldn't tell the stranger, so why do you do that on the Internet?
Or would you like it if you'd like the printing you like what you've warned about your friend?
Do you know others are talking about you?
When you sign the graphs from the party, do you ask for authorization from others to notify them?
And another, should everyone know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to give them understanding that they have to conduct themselves online as they do this offline.
The rules are the same.
"On the Internet, a person is with respect, responsibility and other principles, and it must also be in the ability networks," it states.
Violence
Estuardo Guardia, University Teacher, Professor of Initial Education and Education Advisor, explains the need for family heads to read the network policies.
As they understand each of the items, they have good businesses for interviews with children on the preferences for the opening of the accounts on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to spread or repeat," he says.
According to Guardia, the key question is to remind the lesson "not talk to strangers."
The UNASUR Sammit ends without finding the Limma Declaration
VI The presidential summit of the Union of South America (UNASUR) has been completed today in Peru without discovering the previous and theoretically signed members of the Limburgian Declaration.
Efe tried to get access to the document signed at the VI regular meeting of the Governments of States and Governments of the UNASUR, but the sources of the Conceition and Administration of the President indicated on the main page that it would be submitted after closing, but then confirmed that it would be postponed on the Peruan Government's website at a certain time.
The issues of the text indicated that the content was issued by the President Peru, Olyanta Umala, during short pressing statements.
The access of journalists to information about the Sammate was always available.
Only a day was translated, in the press room, a video of the presidential assembly without a sound with the message "Closed back" and a sound prohibited.
A few information that was given between reporters was given to the press secretariat of some UNSUR governments, which was present at the meeting, but not Peruan.
The only document that was distributed during the day was a list of the presidents involved, which caused the failure of hundreds of journalists from different national and MMEs who requested more information.
Lastly, the President Peru's administration sent an E-mail to the "final declaration" of the SME, but the statement of the Umala statement, not the official document that the Sammit had been completed.
In October last, Peru adopted the III Sammit of South America and Arab countries (A°A), and at the same time, despite that it was urgently required of pressure, the Limish Declaration, which they had previously declared, was also not distributed.
On the Official Website AA, the document was published last Thursday.
At both meetings, the Peruan authorities were attempted to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but the information was maximised.
The Sammit also concluded with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt the Act of the Hague Court, which regulates the territorial existence between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olyanta Umala, and Chili, Sebastian Pinner, gathered at the regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court, which begins to hear the statements of both parties in Hagaga, within the framework of the accusation that Lima had committed against the Santiago.
"We will keep and comply with the decision that will explain the differences we present in this court," Umala said, near his Chilean colleague.
"Chili was, it was, and it would be a country in respect of international law, a peaceful permit for divisions, covenants and courts," added Pinner, and welcomed Umalu's hands on the background of the flags of these two countries.
Under both presidents of their submitting to the International Court, the conflict occurred after Columbia had oppressed the Godothe Pacific on this week, which she recognized the submission of the international court after the decision of the maritime borders with Niʹgua, which she seemed to be misunderstood.
Sammit had no presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christian Kirshner.
The Paraguay, which was arrested in UNASUR since 2011 after his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The President, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for the opening of the discussions on the morning and for the closing of the sammy, almost half later in Limburg.
The Chapter of the State read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and had a 31-year-year-American project, which had a sum of $17 billion.
Among the agreed agreements he mentioned that UNASUR countries would " take important steps to the purpose of the South American citizenship, for which we extend the agreements on residence".
He reported that measures are taken to improve " cooperation in combating the uncertainty of citizens and organized transnational crimes, to increase the accessibility of medicinal products, to enhance Internet access in all the corners of South America and to take into account the risks of natural disasters together and effectively".
Since the crisis is "the Economist Association (Latin America) should not have a triumphatoral basis but must serve to extend our productive basis and to predict the best future for our cities," Umala added.
"We have decided to give a group of 31 signic projects to improve the areas of South America, especially in the villages and border zones, the unit of our countries and the establishment of new economic schemes," said the Peruan President in the reading message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are related to Peru, and they are packed with the axes in its territory, from the age to Brazil, and two are dedicated to a large relationship with Ecuador, but he is not more detailed.
The recent document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve its re-association to the Union of South America," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of welfare and peace would be united, and it would have good terms among the neighbors, was another subject to the same.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before attending the regional meeting, that hopes to meet his colleague from Ni¤Gua, Daniel Orthoi, on the Sabbath in Mexico for negotiations in respectful form of maritime debt, as a result of the verdict of the international court of God-making.
"Wednesday (on Saturday), maybe I'll meet President Daniel Orthoi," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they do not exclude each other, including the Neigua covenant needs discussions," he stressed.
"Con President Ortega, I hope that I can tell him that we are going to handle this most civilized and respectful way," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet the Sabbath in Mexico, where they have been provided for the presentation of the new president of this country, Enrique Püny Neto.
Moreover, the Ministers of Defense of Blocks have already met for the 2013 Plan for Enhancement of Dialogue and Unilaterality on the Protection of the Region.
Argene, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the last participation of the countries has been arrested.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional block.
"South America must learn from the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correo
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a general citizenship is a goal for the "South America, in this case, should be learned from the Property".
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential Society of the South Americas Union (UNASUR) conducted in Lima, stated to Peru the public television that the Peaceers were killed each other during the Second World War and in other contemporaries, "and now they were almost one eating."
He protected, in this context, the draft establishment of South America's citizenship, which approves UNSUR countries.
"The free movement of citizens and slaves in any South American country, as it is already happening to the members of the Indian Community, but there are still reaction sectors that want us to return in the past," he warned.
The Ecuador Chairman has also shown himself as part of the renewal of the United States of the United States (OAG) under the prejudice to reduce the impact of the Englishakson States and to take into account those who signed the Pact San Hose on Human Rights.
Those who read lessons will never take any commitment to themselves, and we, South Americans, sign everything.
"It is not clear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is held by the United States," he stated, as a result of the political refuge, given by the Ecuador, the leader of WikiLeaks Julian Assanju.
Correa assured that he did not complain about this decision because he had not granted his principles with him but kept his "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that at his time " there were certain doubts that Assange would be exploded into the third country and would not be observed."
In addition, the Swedish jurisdiction for the requirement to come to its territory for an investigation of sexual crime, while "the Swedish law only believes that it would be able to be made through a video conference that could be made from Ecuador in London".
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of injury of the physics and mental health of Assanja.
"I didn't talk to him with the couples he came to our business, but the employee told me that he had a small problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuador Chapter of the State.
What it is actually, it is the danger of endangering its physics and mental health because of a small space without the possibility of enforcement of air.
"This affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the refugee issued by Assanju from June in the Ecuadoral Employment in London, by providing an incompatibility guarantee that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is located in the hands of the British, Sweden and the Peace Boards and stressed that there were negotiations in London on the solution to the problem of the WikiLeaks Foundation.
We do not have negotiations on human rights, this is not the word we use in this case, but have been continuous discussions.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and Peopean Court bodies, because Assanja, Balthasar Garson, is a number of processes in various Peace institutions," he mentioned.
And he said, "If the United Kingdom will give tomorrow a guarantee of independence, it will be done."
And if Sweden, as she allows her law, and as she has already done in other cases, asks Senator Assanja to Ecuador in London or asks him for Skype tomorrow, this problem will be dismissed.
Correa reassured the cases to show himself as a protector of the print freedom and stressed that he did not suffer "protection, no consciousness and lies that threatened the freedom of expression".
"The main enemies of freedom are not deceived, but bad journalists supporting life, opportunity and requirement," he said.
In this case, he remained sufficient that any of these journalists, "no bankiers, nor burrowing gagemon countries are in Ecuador," and added that, being re-elected, "deeply revolving for the continuation of the development in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Witness of Paraguay in UNASUR at least before elections, argumenting that " must be strong and not sustainable to the opportunism and support of mass legislation" because "the law of Paraguay Democracy has actually been distorted."
The Ecuador Chairman also considered the "completely based" desire of his Colombian college Juan Manuel Santos now to negotiate with Nicua on maritime borders between two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of Gaagi, which was benefited from the Guyana Sea Sovereignty.
This decision is currently not complied with.
This is a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are unsafe, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
It is necessary to process their communication to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for the good end of the Sea border, which leads to the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "the Latin America is right to take a decision if two countries are committed to make a decision as hard as it would be."
The opportunity to express as candidate to the current presidential elections in Ecuador to ballot for a third time, he pointed out that he considers this possibility "with great optimism and happiness, even though it sometimes is hard enough."
Correa assured that if he lost elections in February 2013, it would be of public life.
I have never been interested in the authority in my personal way, but in wrong situations such as Ecuador, the economic poverty can only be corrected by political authorities.
"My political movement meant that I guaranteed this probably victory, so it must be recognized that responsibility," he said.
In the case of the winning, this would be my last time in the chairman's position, and then we're going out of the public life.
If we lose, the same is the same.
"This is the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new course of the treatment of the Venezuelan President Ugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Venezuela Vice-President Nikolas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment already planned, and that it was expected that he would miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This doesn't mean the health condition of President Chaves," he explained.
The Chapter of the Ecuador State has participated in Lima today in the VI heads of States and Governments of the Union of South America (UNASUR), which has completed calls for a greater regional integration to maintain progress, security and progress.
Mortality of SIDA today is the result of the outer diagnosis
Fabricio was 21 years old when he announced that his analysis on IAID was a positive result.
"I'm ashamed," he recalls the hard one, despite all such a doctor, a moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to cope with sickness, he wanted to know how much more he could, and his efforts were justified, he had already noted his 43th birthday.
Fabricio is one of the "ancient" HIV patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was in 1994, and there were no prejudices.
He lives with the diagnosis "human immunodeficiency virus" (VIH) since 22 years, and it would be difficult to believe that -- too little then, the treatment options were too few, they knew about the disease, too predicted to the disease.
Yes, even the Clinic Director of the Canadian Protection Institute didn't want to forgive him, "for he had a divorce."
In other words, the IAID was a sentence at that time.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it without a deteriorating quality of life.
Nevertheless, without knowing their disease, many people come to this point when the virus has already caused damage, "exist" their immune system and they suffer from opportunist infections.
Following 31 years after the world's presentation, at least after the first stated cases, "the great achievement for this moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment at the same time and the survival of a general population in the same precision," said the HCG VIH section, Hayme Andrade Vilyanua, by agreeing that this information was undertaken in the April of this year in a close scientific exhibition.
The HIV/AIDS infectionist and expert explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that IAID is not a trial, but the duration and quality of life depends on the degree of immune system disorders at the start of diagnosis, with the best expected life in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with number 200 CD4, and up to 50 years when reported about 500 CD4.
Moreover, the above indicated means that those who receive HIV diagnosis at age 25, "with support of control, will be able to live without problems until 75 years," he explained.
In order to evaluate this progress, we should remember that the duration of the lives of the Canadians today is 76 years in the meantime.
Although the employment was significantly decreased in the last years, in case of Me·Aki, the number of people died from IAID was reduced from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (Annual UNAIDS report), as well as that 60 per cent of patients died since the SIDA occurrence.
Only in Halisco, 255 people died in 2011 and have already been registered from 187 to May this year; however, it states that there is a comprehensive access to antiretroviral medicinal products since 2005.
- Why do we have the results?
- I personally think the problem is not accessible to treatment.
So I think that's myself, so there's business in our hospital.
As at least in the past 12 years we had no lack of medicines, the problem is that patients are coming very slightly, because they don't know about their infected condition, mean, at the outer stages of illness.
He introduced the data: "9 of the ten patients comes when they already have some opportunistic infection; what is needed to do to show greater impact on the generality, so that it is to diagnose at the early stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide tests to detect in the mass, for all people who would ask it."
In its proposal, specialists and officers of the State Council on the Properties of IADA in Halisco (COESIDA), as well as the same patients, like Fabricio, who was focused on checking in a private laboratory, which only encouraged his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of IAID and even suffered by the Sercome Caposhi, a cancer poultry, which is one of the distributed complaints.
Everything changes when you know what you have.
They think they're dead, and they don't want to know anything.
"I'm still dead, I'm gonna hope three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There's changes, I'm fine, I'm doing practices, I'm taking medicines.
Today, his parents only know that he was transferring cancer.
I'm doing a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of employment, I travel, I have a active sex life, but with both responsibility, I care about myself and another person," said Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to move my statement to those who now, in the context of the World Day of Conflict with IAID, experienced fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know how much more I can know if they are HIV, so better, and if they have diagnosis, they will know that they can live as any other person, being responsible.
This message resumes the issue of combating the SIDA in this 2012.
Preservation after the adjunction
The great disagreement between health programmes and a simple citizen, states Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahara, who has taken a problem with HIV.
And the biggest is a profile.
In the places in which this task was dedicated, "in fact, the distribution of preservatives has been increased, before we were given one or two, now we have a hundred packages, and this is very good, but it is evident that there are those who do not have access to the preservation until now," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are growth.
"Why are they to you?" It's a Pope question, with equity and conviction, from school advisers, aptex and health careers, which do not want to hear growth, has assured the propaganda.
I propose to amend this inefficiency; that the reserves be not only behind the ships and that their hundreds are in the public tourists in places that often visit young people.
This is not a promotion of discharge.
Not to say about the payment of beer and motel, the Governor Emily Gonzáles answered when he was asked whether there was a preservative delivery at his leadership.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to make preservatives available for those who are already on sexual activity," he noted.
Key data in Halisco
13.435 summary cases are registered (12.158 IDA and 1.317 HIV).
The State takes place the fourth national review on new and summary cases of SIDA and HIV 13.
92 per cent of infections are related to halfway, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent to the periodic road.
According to the assessment, 50 thousand people can live with HIV, since for one case registered there are from 4 to 5 people who do not know about it.
Taking into account the Council of the Appeal Court of the United States of Decision, which cancels the rest of the Group of Vitro, by means of competitive production in Me ́ca, the scenario sets a rock preliminary for any national branch company with branches in the neighbouring country, which has problems with payability.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of a company which is held by the Canadian laws are not mealable in the country of sex and stars, in contrast with agreements.
In the field, the approval of the decision made by Judge Harlin Hail on 15 June in the Court of Bankroom of the North Territory of Texas will remain secure mechanical companies before the possibility of arresting their property on the Rio Grande side.
However, the establishment opens the door to the leading manufacturer of glass in Me ́ca to be treated to the High Court of the United States, providing three unconformities.
As an income, while the Court of Justice notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Banking Code, the Appeal Court of the Fifth Round, which is located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are covered by the competitive production considered in Me Mé Mé Méméca.
The first paragraph underlines the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payment of transnational identity undertakings.
In fact, this aim was established by the United Nations Standard Law on the International Trade Rights, determining as an arbitr of the American Rights Institute.
Secondly, the verdict states that without interim vote, recognised in the critical mass of competitive debt that had before Vitro's mother’s branch company, there would not be a majority of the necessary for restoration.
However, this opportunity is recognised by the Meccan laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when this scheme is adopted.
There are half-year examples including Agremex and Comercial Mexico, whose interoperable guarantees are the Federal Institute of Concurrence.
It is also true that the vote of the officers, whether or not Vitro creditors, who were against him in the courts of the United States, namely the Aurelios Capitals Funds, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached most of them.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
This is the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro in a complex situation, with which it has occurred since 2008, with a serious economic crisis, which has reached the United States, has been attacked by the country.
As long as the family company of Gonzáles Sad will proclaim the decision in the Appeal Court of Justice to reach its captivity, the five judges, regarding the vote of only three.

Heather Heather Reese: "Basketball was my life."
The eating basketball traveller Heather Reese was more than 60 years with this and, thanks to him, the whole world was overwhelmed.
A few people in Puerto Rico keep in memory so many basketball stories like Heather Reese Hector.
Before the blood exhibition in the brain brought him to the invalid cow in 2008, Rayes was insported for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, a player of the High Basketball Ligue, a powerful BSN with Cowboy Bajamon and the President of the Federation of Basketball.
"I have played a lot of roles in the basketball during my life, including sometimes, as I was the President of BSN, the Director-General of the National Team and the President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reese recalls during the visit of Primera Hora at Bajamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Rayes doesn't exhaust it by doing it in the way.
The walls of his house, almost all ornaments of graphs and memory things assembled by his way, testify about it.
Bajamons in the heart
With the greatest emotions, he keeps those who remember his way through Cowboy, starting from the middle of the 50 ’ s as a player until 1982, when 15 years of his presentation were fulfilled in the role of a so-agente or contract agent.
"There were my best years I enjoyed most of all because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys campioners since 1967, as a agent, a so-agente or a ru of the holder.
There were many years of joy, including five campaigns that passed from 1971 to 1975.
And then I went with one in 1981, in the year of Jeroma Minssy's debute to BSN.
From that moment, the leader of the Cookie Ortis, who was a big administrator, said Reese.
I remember Jin Bart, who was here and was at the Alabama University (Birmingh) said to me, "I have a very high player for you, growing 6'7."
"You want?"
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended Sniper Ryan Gauss, who received citizenship and one of our best bombs.
I remember what I said if Mincy had brought Bajamon's campaign, Gauss would have helped to get another.
The Cowboy campaign with Gauss was glad, but I had already been remote because it was a leader of the Federation in 1988.
At that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the national collection.
I remember how we wined the first time in the United States during the Olympian tournament in Me Impact in 1989.
Then came Championat of the World in 1990, on which we received the fourth place, and it should have been a brown, if not the Canadian judge who would forget us to play a final game, Rayes said.
The team of the World Champion in 1990 is the best collection you ever saw?
She's among the best as well as the winning of the Dream Team on the Olympics games in 2004.
But my favorite was that from the Panama American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and destroyed the United States collection, which was quite like the one we wined on the world campions.
In that team, Mincy, Gaussa, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopes and Piculina were played again, but also the young (Havier) Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who could not participate in 90 years of a triumph.
The command, which may not have been the best in the personal construction plan, but brought us a golden medal and great joy, was the Olympian tourist team in Neuken, Argene.
With the role players like Canito Newsea, Paulo Alice and the young Rolando Hurruitner at the place of players who were temporarily removed for unregisters in the Panama campaign of Mar-del-Plat, we won gold despite all the proofs.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, that was Piculin Ortis.
His indicators on tours are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico doesn't dominate at this level as Piculin did.
And it's without the account of his career in the different lines in which he played.
Who was the best portorican?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Meldendes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I like the work of Leo Arilly.
What do you think of your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious epoch of the national collection between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s of the BSN was up to 17 teams in the season.
What's the rest of you doing?
There were things I wanted to identify, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, for boys from Ponse to play only in their area and only against teams of other parts of the island in national play-offs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of the commitment series and the course for managers, officers and judges.
That will make me a lot of pleasure.
What are you doing now?
More I hear, look at the video of my epoch on YouTube, enjoy my grandmothers, and I'm going to the basketball.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife, Icabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Warte (Texas) in worldwide thanks to his main role as John Ross Young, more efficient than "J.R", in the Dalas teleserial, in which he has developed businessmen without principles, evil and manipulating.
Larry Hagman, whose role in the oil of Jay Ar Young in Dallas' teleserial became a symbol of anxiety in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned to this year as J.R. at the new session of Dallas, died on Friday evening because of the risks of cancer, the family statement provided for by the Warner Bros., the "Dalas" production study.
"Larry returned to his favorite Dallas town, playing a characteristic role that he most liked," said his family.
Larry's family and the closest friends were with him in Dallas on the yarmark for the Day of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, playing the role of his wife in the original series and in Sickwell, was near Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, said her representative of Jeffrey Lane.
He gave joy to everyone who knew him.
He was creative, kind, pleasant, mild, and talentful, and I'll be very scared of him.
"He was a original person and lived in full life," Gray confirmed in the statement.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 and admitted that he had been drunk for many years.
In 1995, he found an evil-quality poultry in the wine, and he transferred the transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hegman received television ability through the role of the class type in the "I Dream of Jeannie", translated by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, astronaut whose life changes when he meet the attraction of Barbara Iden, and begins to live with her under one piece.
He was also the main person of two commodities, which rarely appeared in Ether, the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included the role of the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But exactly his master interpretation of an exciting disgusting J.R. brought Hagmen to the top of glory.
The dramatic series of CBS CBS on the clone of Yuing and other persons in its surroundings went in Ether from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who shooted in J.R." reklame, who was behind the creation of a brush around the episode, full of emotions in which Hegmen's person almost killed, has brought a number of discussions and millions of dollars to which the risk was in the buckmecker offices.
This also helped the record auditor at the time.
When the answer was given in the episode from November 1980, in average 41 million telasers looked at it and converted Dallas to the second number of reviews, after the final "MASH" in 1983, which reached 50 million spectators.
It was J.R.'s wife, Christin (in the fulfillment of Mary Crosby) who shot in it.
J.R. dismissed her and then threatened her that she would accuse her in a prostitute if she would not get out of the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Yuing as an unnatural corruptionist with charism: an unfair undertaking and an unfair man who wanted his wife to have a alcoholic wife, Sue Elen (Linda Grey), to treat.
"I know that it must be on the J.R. tomb," said Hegman in 1988.
"The honest citizen of J.R. Yuing is here."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Princepal, also the heroin of the original series, mentioned in Haggman's Friday as someone "ground and outside and outside of the screen".
He is forgotten and unforgettable for millions of people around the world, and in the hearts of each one of us who has been happy to know and love him.
Ten new events of Dallas were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The five episodes of the second season have already been completed and the sixth was in production, reported the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what will be with the series after Hagman's outcome.
Fort Wart, Texas, he was a son of a actor and song Mary Martin, who blew in classic productions such as "South" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still growing when he was born in 1931 during his marriage with Ben Hagman.
He tried happiness at New York's theater scenes at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the VS of England from 1952 to 1956.
When he was there, he met the young Swedish artist May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Haydy, and they lived a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many of them live.
In 2001 he called his memories "Hello Darlin": Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't include anything that would be able to cause any pain or affect them anyway," said Prensa Asociada at that time.
After the transmission, he was gained to promote the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experienced in fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to operations, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to propose some comfort, like, "Do not be afraid, it'll be a little inappropriate for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also acted actively against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course is starting to investigate "Light End"
Each week, students are studying apocaliptic events such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global heat.
In this semester, when the Professor of the Religion Stuart Sharme decided to read the course of the end of the light, he knew that he had an unexpected advice: the end of the "long return account" calendar of May, 21 December, for which many people were arrested as evidence of the end of the world.
But Charme had no understanding that he had been expected in the next few months: the catastrophic Uragan Sandy, the financial crisis that some call "long-eddon" and the conflict in which Israel would be, where Christian theories at the end of the time believe that the Apocalypse would be started.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocaliptical semeter of all," Sharme said to the students of the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If we examine what happens in the world now, as if we have only 30 days, it was really a good period.
And remember that it's bad for those who have apocalyptic thoughts.
And he is not the only professor who makes courses on "the end of the light" in this seed, the theoryly the last in history.
At the Temple University, Professor Barry Waker reads the "Mass Information, Culture and End of the World".
Each week, students are studying apocalyptic subjects such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global heat.
"We analyze why these ideas are exposed to time," he said, and how hypothetic scenarios cause certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls in the hands of terrorists, for example, war can be disrupted.
This month, students studied the film analysis on apocalyptic subjects and studied how they related to real life examples.
"I tried to tell students about the possibility that it was probably not likely," said Waker.
In the main campus of the Pennsylvania University of Latin America's history Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of the history of experience and anthology, were united to read the course that is only called "Light's End".
"We do not add '2012 ' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, if the end of the light does not end," Restall said.
Despite " unchanged resolve", students should learn, prepare projects and provide outcome tests.
In Penn State, a recent review will be taken to Apocalypse canon that will not remain to students of another choice except to work "to the same night that will probably end the light," Restal said.
The curses were a lot of population.
"Locations have been completed in two hours," Restal said about his course for students with a high average ball on which 35 students were recorded.
We received reports on e-mail for many weeks before the beginning of the seventh of people who asked if there were other places.
Students, in their range, assured that this course is one of the most interesting ones.
"I like to observe what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgeid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic picture of thinking, light or religious, it is only a question of comfort or dissuasion.
Will Vekes, a 25-year student of psychology and sistership, said that he was looking at all apocalyptic films.
"I never heard about a course that would learn about this," he noted.
I like him.
But no one of the invited students - not talking about the professor - said he believed at the end of 21 December.
"Our first project was concerned about the prophecy of May, and in some kinds we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year student of the last course at the University of Temple from West Chester.
May never predicted the end of the light; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there was an apocalipt of anxiety in the west culture, which counts a few centuries, where people react to change around them, predicting the end of the light.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Privately in the English speaking world.
Joseph Doggerty, professor of the University of La Sal, who teaches the courses at Philippines this year, replied quickly on the question whether he knows any course of the "the end of the light" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the light," he wrote, insisting on the exhibition of the highest instance.
We have mercy from Pa's.
Restall noted that a long time was discussed about many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people will begin to think about the date" or to philosophy that 21 December is the beginning of the seven-year period in which the world will end.
Students and teachers are insufficiently related to this date.
They said they'd go to the "Light end" party.
"I may call someone of my friends to smile together," is Samira Ford's comment, a 20-year-old student of a community faculty.
