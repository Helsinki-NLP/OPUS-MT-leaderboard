Food debt to ≥ inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro zone is the racial increase in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the Eurozone, the deterioration was expected in November, after 2.6 Pro > in October was registered an annual inflation rate of 3.1 Pro, as reported by the EU Statistics of Luxembourg.
Of the prognoses have only been out of 3 Pro, reported Bloomberg.
On the contrary to the British, British and Canadian Note Bank, the European Central Bank (BCE) did not give the leadership to the leadership, which would benefit from the increased prices of rubber and the easily reduction of worklessness.
The ECB is best to keep the inflation rates under two Pro, or at least at the two-pro-mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the mixture: Inflation must be "complied" to exclude the need for later action.
In November, in Germany, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record; in Spain the rate of 3,6 to 4,1 Pro.
For the increase in inflation in the euro zone, the cost of food and energy prices are responsible for the increase in the inflation in the euro.
The MATIF weight notations increased by 88 Pro, and the course for sojabone also reached a recording since 1973.
Furthermore, food oil and milk products were a significant deterioration in 2007.
The world price for roh oil increased in this year by 52 Pro · in the past month, the price per phase of black gold reached nearly 100 US.
According to the ECB, the inflation will increase from 2,1 to 2,5% in 2008, however, with a decrease of 1,9% in 2009.
For the coming 3-4 months, the analysis results from a 3-pro-inflation rate, but the annual average rate of 2,1 Pro.
Experts consider that the ECB will decrease the rates two times for 2008.
Gallup is a government crisis
After a long stagnition, the number of Fidesz sympathisants has grown significantly until the beginning of December. First time since 2002, the Partie has passed over the largest basic set, while the approval of the socialists has never reached a depth of 13 Pro.
In the partial electors, the subsection is clearly expressed by the high deficiency of the opposite behaviour: more than two thirds (71 Pro©) are a fifth (20%) approval for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are in question under the parliamentary income rate: they come to the total population to two Pro.
The number of parties choosers is grown in both stocks around a pro.
In comparison to the latest depth, the general economic vote has continued to be worse - never before the part of those who consider the country's economies as a "prohibited bad" as high (41%), while more 46 per cent of them remained "dayly bad".
After hopeful views in early and summer, the families see the change of their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population are calculated with a further deterioration of the situation; only one decade results from a improvement.
A question made in December of Gallup stated that 71% of the applicants, a historical higher, evaluated the work of the Prime Minister as "before bad than right".
Three Pros of the Questioners have large confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of the beliefs for Viktor Orbán 38 Pro.
54% do not trust the Governing Boss, compared to 27% of mistakes against Fidesz's Participants.
One of the indicators of the political vote is the number of those who believe that the incompatibleness with the President could also be received without a change in government.
In the past October, 35% of the rest of the Government and the Governing Boss have discussed the disasters, this share is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
As a question of their interest in the vote of the people, 60 Pro replied that they would "security" parties, and another 20% of their vote would probably be given.
In comparison, if the Parliament's elections were located in this Sunday, only 55 per percent would go to the urns, 15 per cent remained their participation as "probably". In view of these tendances, the result of the national vote would be dismissable.
74% would vote against the counterparts, 79% against the practical tax, 84% against the hospital rate.
The group of participants in the "safe" vote group would be the shares of the enemies of the enemies of the enemy, practical and hospitalal households even 81, 84, and 89 Pro.
Auchan in the first, Tesco added at almost a five
The hypermarkets in the Buddhist trade area also maintained the average price increase of 16% of the last year, with the subsequence that this year there was no increase in additional taxes.
Articles from Napi Gazdasag
In the Buddhist trade triangle, the price of the "Napi" usually increased by 16 % in this year, however, in all hypermarked price increases were registered by over 1000 HUF.
After the prices in the food markets are "davogagnaged" in the past December, the duration is proactively not drastic, compared to the higher, previous initial level.
However, the consumers are determined to have a fearful effect that, for which they paid in the last year under 9.000 HUF, this year is not even available for 100,000 HUF.
The price of the "Napi" goods corb exceeds the magic 10,000 HUF greence of at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The maximum price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was at 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and living fish remained almost at the previous year level, highly decreased, are overcome by the prices for potter brushfilts, nuss and moon.
Prices for meal and bread included the data of the Central Statistics of Hungary, however, in Auchan there were 1 kg breadwecks for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price turnure under 200 Forint on the product.
At the same time, the price of two litres of Coca-Cola pfand flash was under 200 forint, so the drink was costed only 257 HUF.
However, this year, in the "Napi" comparison of goods corbs, Auchan is the most favorable, and Cora is the most favorable.
Our beefs have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" goods corb against the Wednesday prices in the past 15th year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18%.
The subsequence between the most costly good corb of the previous year and the most closest of this year was 12%, while the increase between the balanced good corb of the past year and the estimate of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1.206,00 Forint in the previous year, however, the additional tax increase in prices was observed at last night.
This is the fact that the trade has been aware of the fact that the houses of goods were not able to decide exactly what price rates they should apply in the individual articles, since the impact of the price increase on consumption was inevitable.
(If the manufacturer plants the cycle speed of a product bad, it can fall by significant wines in the price rates that are guided by the intensity of increase.)
In the past year, the tax-condition of the "Napi" goods corbe was so radical that the highest corb exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price undershade was only 844 Forint.
In this year, such extremes were not observed, since the highest corb costed more than 1.630,00 Forint than in the previous year, and even in the most costly, there was a price increase of ↓84.00 Forint.
In comparison with the last two Wednesday seasons, a disastrophe price increase shown, the price of the daily consumption articles in the hypermarks has been increased in less than 20 months in more than 30 pro.
(In this case, the data of the Central Statistics of Hungary are not required: In some basic feeds, the statistical office defined a more than 30 percent duration during the period of 12 months.
So in near meal also in eggs.)
However, if you have a cup in the "Napi" goods corb, this seems to be almost impossible in the latest, since the price level of the price has been increased in the worst case of a fewer than 10 percent in the previous year.
Obviously, meal suppliers were in a stronger position than the eggs - still were able to distort the drastic increase of prices to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarches are not complained; it is reported for good years.
Our experience shows that most of the customers in the three houses of goods are not looking at the prices anymore.
They are purchased from all large quantities, sustainable foods go into palettes over the ladentics.
In the middle of the morning, there were in all three houses of goods unexpected smileys in the cash, as soon as the number of customers exploded.
However, a smaller customer frequency is reported by the country, thus many of the researchers regret that they could not even get the planned implementation, not only for food but also for sustainable consumptions.
Location is deleted to defects.
More than thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, which were to return to an inconsistent treatment with antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overlooking of beds, the overloading of the staff - everything that is not exactly relevant to the end of the infections, so the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology.
The places are also divided with defects.
In the Traumatology Department of Janos hospitals, a MRSA infection was recently established.
The resistant bacteria against antibiotics was found in a human patient who was given to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The damage of a severe car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. A major operation could not be performed since the bacteria that still exists in the body of the patient.
By 10 December this year, infections from hospitals 1094 were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, so the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Space, Karolina Böröcz.
So many, multi-resistent infections have been registered in the hospitals with security, but the dark digits should be.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were solved by MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin.
The staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria has approximately a third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-conditioned infections (e.g. hallucination, mandel burning, skin burning or wounding) are most well responding to antibiotics, they are well healthy.
However, if the resources are too high or inappropriately applied, the well-reaging antibiotic resistant bakteries are quickly spread in the hospitals under the relevant conditions.
Included in patients with weak or permanently wrong functioning immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause serious infections such as wound infection or blood infection, such as sepsis.
According to your leader of the Janos hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such cases belong to the day of Kra’s House.
You can't change the infection with the epidemy, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is only not where it is not searched.
Resistent against antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the responsible staff takes gummies and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics needed to be treated" - so Tibor Nyulasi.
Although the patients are studied at MRSA when they are injected in the hospital, an infection can not always be avoided.
Receptions too rare
The majority of the infections in hospitals exposed by MRSA would be preventable, however, the current governing conditions and circumstances are unnecessary to conclude the exhibition or spread of the multi-resistance advocate, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and age homes, the hospitals should examine the given patients and isolate MRSA in immediately.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals, microbiological test receipt is not practiced so often.
Not too late, because there is no advantage for this investigation from the State hospital.
Therefore, most of the cases come to the light of the day, if the patient already has a significant MRSA infection, so the leadership of the epidemiological area.
On the side of the European Union, there are strike recommendations for the appropriate application of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and disease images.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, meaning that microbiological investigations are necessary so that there is no resistance to the fund, but this Directive of hospitals will not always be kept.
In the ambulants, or in the basic supply, microbiological tests are even rare, such as Karolina Böröcz.
Parties shall be in the disinfectation medium
Increasing evidence shows that MRSA is most often transferred by a patient to the other.
That is why the handwater, or the carrying of hands and masks, has a great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is being infected or contacted, but in the home hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the patients in the population.
The rooms are even often overflowed, the beds are almost swimming each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1,5 metres from epidemiological view.
As Karolina Böröcz continues to note, unfortunately, in the financially less well placed hospitals even suggest that in defectives, there are few infections, many patients - everything that will benefit from improving infections.
Such infections are evidently less frequently, relatively the further spread of the acquirent can be stopped where these protection measures are observed, such as Karolina Boröcz.
Government Programme against MRSA
MRSA infections in the board cause the hospital insurance great costs, therefore they will be controlled overall.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their involvement in the Government programme was established.
According to the first signs, the programme - how the data are shown, the tendence of MRSA infections in England is delayed.
The European Centre for the Prevention of Sickness (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the exhibition of multi-residents (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.
Deathlink Policy Chef was not drunk
In the case of the police officer of the XXII. A car accident caused by death is now the official opinion.
The middlely returned police officer of the XXII. The districts, who killed a footpasser on Sunday at a car accident, were not alcoholized or under influence, said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Budapest Oberstat Agency on Friday after the official opinions were presented.
The observation made the results of the first investigation, as the police officer had not consumed alcohol before he was on tax.
The former police officer book with its own pkw in XXII. Inside the Cossuth Lajos Street, he passed over a 55-year-old man who passed the street to an unknown place.
(Tells SVO that, however, has no mildness - the linker, even if footpassers don't overcome the street at the cebra street, afterward.)
The footpasser has taken his damage after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the linker takes a shock, then puts his functions back and requests pension.
The Budapest State Advocate has started its investigations.
In addition, Atila Morvai noted that the former police officer had cooperated with the medicals from the beginning.
More 400 million EUR for infrastructure
Financial Minister Janos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) have undertaken three credit agreements in Budapest in the total value of 400 million EUR on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a 300 million EUR framework for the financing of projects for cohesion and environmental protection, which are implemented with subsidies from the Cohesion Fund.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the Leasing Treaty shall also be applied to the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved 300 million EUR for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining 150 million EUR will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit contract.
In the area of innovation, the contracting partners have undertaken an agreement of over 50 million euros, which will lead to research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the U-Bahnline 4 also came to the language.
It was agreed that Ungarn had cleared the details of the U-Baby financing with the EU, the original Treaty and possible modalities are re-debated.
According to Janos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects at a total of EUR 8,4 billion in Hungary.
The credit prices are linked to EURIBOR, which is granted by the EIB with an eight-year exemption, free of provision.
Bulgaria, the EU's immobility paradies
The development of Bulgaria's immobility is fabulous - all Europe looks carefully on the former rare Balkan state.
What, where, and who's still buying the highest market in the EU, but racist?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most desired plant for immobility buying in the east room, with favorable ski apartments and houses at the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most popular regions, in the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coasts", the "Sound Coasts", and the historical towns Sozopol and Nessebar, however, the real estate is still more asked about Kavarna and Baltic.
Following reviews of Re/Max Analysts in Bulgaria, the country’s index would also be invoked by former or later investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the exposed favourable area of Russian buyers.
The main city of Sofia also offers locking boats - trade and office areas offer the highest rendites.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive Golfer Paradises, thus locking tourists next to the sommer and winter season in the two other years.
Thus, previewing investors have already been bought in a large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who gain immobility in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their life change.
Most buyers are English, but they are also interested in France, Others, Spain, and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are most Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to leave are buying revitalised immobility about 50-100,000 euros, or missing houses about 5-15,000 euros, who then renew themselves.
Good connection and accessibility and communication options are written large, but the closer to a large city, business and doctors are determining for the buyers.
The second category belongs to those who are looking for a ferimentomizil (Bulgaria was listed in December under the Top Ten vacation targets of Germans).
The group includes businessmen investing with the aim of a medium-to- long-term value increase.
Immobility in the main town will be more stretched in the running town, provided the always growing request.
Inside the EU, the immobility prices in Bulgaria are lowest, but in the past five years there was an increase in prices about 21 per year.
The insurance at the immobility prices exceeds the elevation of the containers.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
As the Minister for the Environment Gabor Fodorgab, the expert meetings end on Thursday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers in the midweek after the official development.
Experts and more of 192 countries are consulted on the Bali Road Plan, where the emission reduction measures have been established for the period after 2012, so after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
Currently, there is a strong debate between industrial and development countries.
The United States have already signaled that they do not want to negotiate with specific numbers, but they would be ready to reduce the gas emissions in comparison to 1990 to 25-40% until 2020.
The other major question of the conference is whether industrial countries are ready to reduce emissions to the developing countries both financially and ecologically.
A agreement on the support of developing countries was also made.
The adaptation fund submitted to the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-country Council, probably in the global environmental facility (GEF) of the United Nations, as follows the "Piac is Profit".
Hungarian Six Pro
Environmental Minister Gabor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will reduce the gas emissions by 20% until 2020 (measured by the 1990 values), independent of whether the "Accord after 2012" will be achieved or not. The Union would even be ready to take place for a 30% reduction, so that other large industrial countries of the world and developing countries are also willing to comply with their obligations in force and responsibilities.
Gabor Fodor highlighted that the objective of the States attached to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, while the EU had already committed to a minimum of 8% with its 15 Member States.
The standard for Hungary is a reduction of the gas emissions by 6% compared to the 1985-87 - a standard that will be fulfilled by the country as follows the pressing report of the Ministry of Environment.
The use is high on Bali - the long-term international climate policy agreement must always be completed within two years, elsewhere it would take into force with security only after 2012. In this case, the reduction in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, which also includes the IPCC, the international, the scientific climate change committee of the United Nations in the latest report.
This would delay emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth would be inevitable for more than 2°C, which would have resulted very serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army we're on YouTube
British army units have made records of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan increasing popularity on the video portal.
YouTube has discovered to the British Air Waffe (RAF) YouTube: Loaded special units in Afghanistan since March 2006 on the transactions against the Taliban, BBC reports.
The records of the air weapons in Kandahar are checked at the airport point in Candahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message unemployable
Airwaffen soldiers have already contributed to 139 such records, their "canal" was considered more than 75,000 times.
The British Defence Defenceheadquarters was registered in early 2007 to make videos about Iraq and Afghanistan operations, but also the British Foreign Minister (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace streets (MNFI) in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
The air weapons have originally published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Defence Minister says, the contributions also serve to inform people about the objectives of the foreign areas.
Such artified Propaganda is almost free in comparison to originating televisions, such a defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos always have a certain measure of political message, since they visit the existence of military measures made by the Government in their own way.
Switch Americans with game
But the army must also fight against amateur records, which, besides the careful, censured records, also create in the network - such as those who show the death of the soldiers: In the "official" propagandafilms, the most lost, but the blue sides of the war are not shown.
Furthermore, from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have already been loaded a number of videos in use on the platform, but these "gatting" have discovered the Britans for a short time.
The Americans throw into something else, namely with the free-loadable shooting game "Americas Army", in which the player can go into the skin of the soldier in a more or less lifestream simulation.
Wednesdays with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministry
Lamperth's labour minister Monica is no longer embarrassing: instead of a Wednesday celebration, she has a working conference in which their employees can be able to make coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministers celebrate with live music, other summer night vote with Tombola or anxieties in the officers.
Party, Wednesday vote, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Wednesday Feeder has already recognised the charges.
The greatest Wednesday celebration of the Ministry will be held today in the defence resort, but the workers of the Ministry will not be expected.
At the "Wednesday Festival" children are protected by falling soldiers, at the "Mission Festival" family members are currently assigned to soldiers stationed in the foreign, but there is also a receipt for the press.
The resort provides approximately 25 million for celebrations.
In comparison with other resources, the National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic and Ver­ses are undertaken by the National Development Agency.
The 4.32 million Forints of the Economic Ministry's Wednesday Festival will be held in the house of the future, expecting approximately 350 of the 600 employees.
The point of festivals is on Wednesdays, but it will also give life-acts and a tombola-release.
The National Development Agency (NFU) has held its 4,7 million Forint celebrations in the Middle Week in the House of the Court of Justice (OIT) with concerts and a festival.
The salamite was 1 million Forint, which was issued for more than 400 laden guests.
According to our information, a NFU department has also been invited at another Wednesday Festival, which is made by the Hungarian Economic Development Space (MAG Zrt) from the EU Gulders.
For the festival, the building of the lusty game theater ("Vigshínáz") was mixed.
The MAG Zrt has not published this information because we have not reached the authorities.
What's the crap?
The OIT building was not only open to the NFU guests but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball on 7 December.
They did not have to put the OIT in order to use spaces.
500 of them came to the ball.
The festivals were exhausted with an appointment of the Minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], they were shared with: it was not a ball-leaving or appealing obligation on the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Work, and self-administration are prepared for puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health celebrates the feast for the workers in their four walls for approximately 400,000 Forints.
Lamperth's work minister Monica officially does not give its employees to a birthday feast, but to a conference on the annual outcome.
It is calculated by about 180 guests that - so the press section - only with coffee and pogatsche, the festival comes out with 350,000 Forint.
The self-administration Minister Gordon Bajnai will simply take place with his colleagues in the Ministerial Aula.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) shall celebrate a weekend in its own festival, at which 436 workers are expected.
The exhibitions were measured with 2.500 Forint per head - for this money there is a buffet receipt with the following advantages.
Since the beginning of the office of Janos Veres, the workers of the PM celebrate in this way each year.
However, there will not be a right party breakfast - not only because of the official talk of the Minister but also because the party was appointed for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agricultural Agricultural Agricultural Affairs takes a new year's receipt this time.
One hundred guests in Schloss Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget") are requested; according to the outcome of the Ressorts, the exhibitions are measured with 1.000 Forint per host.
As reported by the Presse Department, it will be a very simple steam receipt to which only foreign diplomats are accredited in Hungary.
The receipts that are made each year start traditionally with a short advantage of the Minister and sounds with retaining mouse.
As the respective pressures report on [origo] request, there will be no Wednesday feast in the foreign or educational Ministry.
As asked for the costs of the Wednesday Festival, there was no outcome at the Presse Department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were charged to celebrate in the artistic museum.
Always more powers mobilised for riesen-streak
The Liga Agencies and the Hungarian Federation form their coordination committee on Friday for the non-determined duration of the Strategy starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a Protest growth assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the vote on the hospital insurance law - starts the labour.
It is calculated by strike-conditional, significant restrictions to deterioration, since the railway traffic is almost completely set up, and the Budapests also strike up to 13 hours.
Details on the round on Monday will be given together on Friday afternoon by the Liga Workshops and the Federing Feedback.
It will also be established by a LIGA - MOSZ Streak Committee, responsible for coordinating actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a Protest Great Assembly will be held, and from Monday all organizations who have joined the streak will decrease the work for an unusual time, unless there is no agreement with the Government.
In other words, the end of the vote on the day of Parliament was not defined on the starting streak on the hospital insurance law.
If the National Council does not accept the hospital insurance law, the workshops shall return the call to strike immediately.
However, if the Law is dismissed, the strike commissions shall be gathered together to consult the further action.
As regards the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even thought that it comes only in the later hours, or at the middle of the vote on the hospital insurance law.
The streets starting on Monday are to be considered with significant impairment: the railways lay down their work for an unusual time, the majority of the public resources and more than the help of Volán-Communities.
At the same time, there will be many places in the locking of the car.
The call to strike is followed by numerous works and civil organizations - the list of participants is currently updated on the Liga Website.
Some organizations announced an unusual time strike, other plans are planning a time-limited labour delay.
By Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the free business of the VDSZZ railway, even though there were still more people on the road.
After present reports, the BKV from the start of operation until 13 hours, Budapest airport between 7 and 9 hours early, which LIGA power and warm energy facilities layer for four hours, and the teacher work, e.g. the Democratic Teacher School, has called to 2 or 2-8 hours.
The Hungarian physician association is highly alternative to various times that EDDSZ, the democratic association of employees in the health and social area, a SZEF sub-organisation, the For­work for cooperation, remains a second-time warning.
The main of the four points requested by the Liga is that the Government takes back the draft reform of the hospital insurance and provides a new concept for social discussions.
The second request relates to the gradual introduction of the new pension behaviour model, which will occur since the next year.
Requirement No 3 means that the approved professional groups of primary pension systems are allowed to be accessed before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZC of Liga, which is part of Liga, has not accepted the netlines concerned and now requests a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Garden increases State risk
According to the risk analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of Political Capital, the Assets of the Hungarian garden, which was based in this August, have highlighted the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
In the "Risk Warning Report" of the Institute, it is, among other things, that in relation to the Assets of the Hungarian Garden, the highest political risk is the "depreciation of the existing ethnic spending between the cigarette and the non-cigarian population in Hungary, which could even lead to a short-term ethnic complication.
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Garden, which is probably aimed at provoking such extent as the research institution.
As reported, this will be considered as a deficiency of the political responsibilities: "The people of the public life have left the discussion of the Roman Question Representatives of radical political groups, which now have built their political positions on the Roman-Hungary agenda."
It is believed that this is a challenge that makes the reasonable dialogue unable to gain extreemities, and the probability of violent interactions would increase.
In addition, the research institution considers that the activities of the Hungarian Garden have not been recently taken into account by the enormous attention of the home and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary in the foreign, especially regarding the confidence in stability and democracy."
We admonish: Since Herbst 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has continued to be raised, thus several organizations called "national self-defence" have been established since Summer 2007.
"These groups are generally defined as civil organization, while they are open to prepare their members - including armed - defence tasks (catastrophen protection, country defence, order protection), in vocation to the inevitability of the police, the army, in relation to the State itself," he said.
And further: All of this happens in accordance with the method that is trying to deal with different, based on the population's disturbance, political efforts as citizens' initiatives.
The point of view of the civil character and the conciliation, therefore, is not only the environment of legal forces that could occur on the basis of the entry into court - it is also a political situation.
As the analysis is to be accepted, the activities of the Hungarian Garden also constitute an increased risk in relations with the neighbouring countries.
"In the past months, the Hungarian Garden was quoted as a potential source in several neighborhood countries, as some ultranationalists of certain neighborhood countries see the activation of its own anti-Hungary policy in the department of the Hungarian Garden.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - said it.
From the view of the research institution, the establishment of the Hungarian Garden is not a single phenomenon in Central East Europe, therefore the political risk for the whole region is grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Garde are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Garde, whose establishment was granted in August 2007 by the Extreme of the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the bulgarian garden, the Roma mass exhibitions found in a city quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the cases at the same time to the access to the establishment of the national garden, with the argument that the goal of the "National Protection" organisation is.
In the past 17 years, their opinion was, in Bulgaria, a regular cigarette territory, but the State remained unfair and indifferent - so political Capital.
And further: The initiative would have made a strong debate in the bulgarian public.
As stated, the increased risk for ethnic interruptions is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roman organizations have announced to make their own garden in opposition.
Since the A’s garden of Hungary too many similarities shown by the Bulgarian National Garde, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Romans also respond to their own protection to the threats, it is in the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, on request of the news office, said: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institution.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and should be recognised by risk changed trends, the public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Festival days are not all holidays
In Hungary, festivals are legally regulated, thus the practice of re-disposition of working days has been established in the middle of the festival, however, the next year will protect us less than those days.
Even in the EU and in America, you understand something else under "Fiedday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state-friendly and working days.
Free working days are most of the church festivals, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we celebrate the New Year: as long as the last day of the old, as well as the first day of the new Year are free - the last days are only so that the silver feeders can be able to go out.
Over the whole year, we have four feasts in total.
The State festival is the 15th March, which refers to the revolution of 1848, and on 23 October, the Memorial Day of Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, the State foundation, on 1 May, will be recorded of our dead on 1 and 2 November.
Moreover, there are two festivals at East, Pennsylvania, and Wednesdays.
Since our state, national or religious festival rarely falls on a weekend, the practice of "workday movement" has been observed in cases where we would work only a day before or after the feast.
The price of the extended weekends is, however, that we must work at the weekly stages before, or go to school.
Where this day, which falls before or after the feast, shall finally be taken away, the Minister shall be established in a own regulation for a long period of years.
The legislation applies to all employees and employers, to public employees and officers of the public service.
Except only companies and entities in which the operation without interruption, as well as at the festivals, is continued.
Today, the working rule will only be made by the celebration at the end of the year: since 24 December, life remains formable, since most of the days between Wednesdays and Silvester Time Similarity, or the vacation that it has been rejected.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the weekend, or at the end of the week, so there will be less displacements in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first round about the day of work "set on the head" so that people can stay at home at the same time four days.
Saturday, 26 April, will be a working day so that the Friday, 2 May, may be a breakday.
The second conversion is related to the Friday on 23 October: on Saturday, on 18 October, you will need to work forward on Friday, 24 October.
However, the end of the year will remain in the sign of the festival, after everything lies and remains from 24 December, even if silver falls on a middle-week.
Six disturbing minorities to endanger work colleges
E-mails that we forget to check, language messages that we never receive - ungrateless lies that do not see us anymore: they bring "Colour" to the workplace every day.
The question is only whether you are used to these small inaccessibilities, or to improve the challenge and try to avoid these incomprehensible situations with awareness of other dangerous situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the Marketing Department," says a colleague.
It's that you've dismissed a meeting?
In the best case, it is to be long-term and trying to make it good, perhaps calling at the Marketing Department, and reproaching, forgetting to send the message (that is the less usual method).
Most of the things have been dismissed with a excuse.
Before we are in penalty, we should consider how to prepare his colleagues really unappreciative moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Something that doesn't belong to himself?
There's a little more nervous than if you take a document, a office audience, or the phone, but it's not there.
Tonight the hall device was still on the desktop - is it gone tomorrow?
Or is the lost bowl writer discovered on the desktop of a colleague?
Without a question, nothing should be removed from the colleagues because they will be injured rightly if they find out that something has gone away.
So, no covered or post-it from the office, because it could take one to himself: nothing more if you're getting it triggering.
We're going to do that, but we're not going to do it.
There is no effective means to keep a treasure already placed in the world.
Who's doing what with whom?
Where and why?
The information (or mutualities) on the life of colleagues should not be possible for everyone to the nose!
And if someone opens and gives us his inner secret, we should not miss this confidence!
It is best to be weakened as a grave, rather than just not to make the presents, even if others know about the problems of the college.
Without a reason, you reported sickness?
If you call in the Office to report yourself in vocation to challenging head pains, because you just want to feel disappointed, or simply want to disturb yourself, you should be over one in clearance: your own work, unexpected experiences, projects with fixed meetings, now the colleagues need to perform oneself.
So don't play the colleagues badly!
If you know that it will not be made to the office next day, or that something could be overcome, why you should stay home, you should report it timely so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will be unexpectedly confronted with the disabilities.
Propertyumme, kitchen, phone
You are just deeply in his work, but is it suddenly threatened by the sound faces of the colleagues?
Does a phone talk that wouldn't be better to hear?
The colleagues should not be nervous with summers, songs, sound talks (which leads over their heads), tramps, permanent shipping or norcles.
All of this can be very slaging, even though they are not just in a task (writing, planning, organising).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not finished, you have forgotten a important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forget!
If possible, you should not go to the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It's the best thing to do with his mistakes, and I'm sorry if others have been affected!
The question of how to rebuild the mistake, or how to recover the confusion, is only too much!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Trainingshose and sleep: Become home, but nothing has lost in the office!
Not even then should you be clothing so bad if the workplace would be allowed!
Just not to be too lamped - both his colleagues and yourself should respect that you are clothing in the office accordingly - if you want, even beautiful and elegant!
It wants all to make it right - or how to be uninterested for others
Stop and go-ver, the car is in the middle of the morning.
From the radio, a rare melodie: the sound of a glass, parsed with electronic effects.
I'm rotating the volume.
The time changes, to the current sounds comes from the bass, and as a real sound bullshit a female chor.
It's the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, which covers mr2.
The home musicians haven't just used us with a quality electrop for long time.
But now you even see the stage different if you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and upset production from the home digital underground scene → slowly contributed to a change of the total image, even if the garage rock with rubber is "in" again, the home electricop shows: There are news under the sun.
Baláz Záger started in Pês, musicated himself in the Yonderboi band before he - maybe because a business house doesn't have two feeders - began to write his own way.
The interruption with the project (Zagar) and its music, the elements of Jazz, electronic, and Pop smiled, but he created only when you requested to compose the Sound Track to a movie (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation that began in smaller clubs was the larger public first when the magazine "wan2" set its first album from 2002 under the top 50 home albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, shorted nearly the only trend set in the west.
Unfortunately Zagar and his band "Trendy" were not interested in whether they would like this mark too.
The band responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album currently appeared with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open them new ways, but the title is already the desire to continue with the Pizza years.
The expression occurs at the time when Baláz Záger was still on the road with another band.
The air, flying call would also be okay, but the atherian character of music falls near the - the journalist and the trend corresponding - la ́e gitarre, the influence of rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the Sanger György Ligeti, who lived in England, and worked with the band "The Puzzle" at the Premier in the Millennium.
A song from the album has even created it to the radio shooter - the newest of early to late Popmusic sending mr2 Pet·fi has made the auditors with the number "Wings of Love", which has been recorded by six domestic songs ("Background Divas"), successfully set the ohrwurm.
All right, so (?).
The hvg.hu asked Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new Hit asks the question: How long does your music keep a certain shit?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "scheck music" doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two boxes in the popmusic, and not stream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be visible and unseen, but it can be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial.
Along with a pop number can be found from a honest motive.
The recording preparation of the hearer is also functioning in accordance with this principle, from languages and country borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a subsequence in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign public against your music?
B. Z.: In the outerland, especially westernly, the popmusic has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twens to concerts but also the older public.
They follow the trends in the popmusic that run around them, much more attention, because they also hold them for part of the modern culture.
hvg.hu: What role is involved in the public in the work?
Is it important who, where, how many people hear your music?
B. Z.: Of course, it is a feeling of seeing that there is always more to our concerts.
But we have never composed for the market.
The music is not with us to serve a purpose, but with a certain reason.
The role of the public is most likely in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but they are only in the inaccessible changes of the moment.
Yet, I'm not surprised that if you want to make it right to everyone, you're not interested anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's as a solest on the road, and he's building his car in the west.
B. Z.: We're not really going his way, just as you're always trying to interpret it again in our music.
We see ourselves more than the teamplayer, who trust in the musical presence of the other and allow them to disappoint themselves.
At first, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi were increasingly, because many of us came from his band and put a different way.
hvg.hu: In the Charts of Mr2 Pet日fi, "Wings of Love" is first.
The name Zagar has only been heard in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously inserted with a little more else style in the direction of a larger public?
B. Z.: We didn't have plans to write a hit that would then be held as a trailer for the album.
It's more about this song.
It was thought as the finalist of the Alba, with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the more weaker topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why just she, what was the leadprin?
B. Z.: The basic thought was to make a gospel-artist chor.
Then the idea came to construct the Chor from the covered solists of the home musicians.
Thus the six-core Chor has occurred - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enik · Hodosi [Neo], Juci Neemeth - which we then baptized more "Batterground Divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song, or did the girls make it?
B. Z.: The number was already longer in the instrumental version, but when the material for the album was completed, we thought that this number was still "a thing".
The academic follow-up has formally requested a vote.
I've done the melodie on the same night, then they've learned the girls.
Everything was practically on Anhieb and terrible spontan.
I can remind me that I was very electricized at that time, but it has already needed the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never be so powerful.
hvg.hu: As well as at the concert, you had the impression that the girls would be in the background.
There is no solo party (without the short Solo of Judy Jay), they do not have their own role, sing perfectly together and are not la• as the music, so their angle is not only associated with music.
They also stood behind the boat.
Is it an idea?
B.Z.s.: The fact that they have been standing behind was so because of clean technical problems.
However, we would not have been able to allow them sole roles.
In the number, it is also because you have to forget his ego a little, forget who comes from and where it is on the road, let us simply let these certain flights, the flights of love us.
I would like to see others also this euphoric state that we have seen when the song has come out.
hvg.hu: What was the most outer song?
B. Z.: In the musical creation work, it has given more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I played on a concert clavier, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove didn't work longer, but after and after everything happened, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Z.: This changes with the concerts and now, where I have the album "lossing".
Currently there is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and "Never The Same".
Business Maker risked for billions of minority feelings
Boardless Trainings
As a result, his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French Bankenriese Society General, owner of the existing commercial bank.
She was about five billion euros because of her.
But it seems better that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it equal to his colleagues, it was certainly not able to be more.
For subdivision to all large banking houses, he at the time recognized the crisis of the Ananian hypothecs.
"He's mentally weak," he was to hear from the mouth of his representatives who showed him at the police.
However, as shown by Kerviels, which published the French media, such as the Daily Journal Le Monde, was a man who had achieved the end of the last year with his business wins of 1,6 billion euros.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to deserve money for my bank," he said in his statement.
On Sunday, he was able to deserve a half billion euros just in the Ananian crisis.
The opportunity was, therefore, that he had already shown it at the beginning of the year.
In February, the first news was given that such sub-Prime hypotheches, such as income weak customers or those who had previous payment problems, would be in difficulties.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had spent up to 1,6 billion euros.
"Now when I had deserved the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Karviel adds and continues to say that he absolutely had nothing to keep for himself.
With the whole hearing, he gives it to him that he has a record that he doesn't want to go on the scarlets.
He even was able to lead his boss behind the light, even though the Eurex boards were interested in his business.
risk benefit
Did he care to be thrown up?
No, no, no.
"I thought she was satisfied with the fair fact that I deserved 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to make his position gradually.
In the Society General, he arrived in 2000, immediately after he had completed his space at the University of Lyon.
His annual amount was about 51,000.
After two years, he was already a Maker assistant, and in 2005 he became an independent maker with an annual amount of 90000.
Yet, he knew that he would never deserve so much as others.
"When I was first talking in 2005, I knew you were watching me.
Because of my training and also because of my famous and personal development," Kerviel explained the research officer.
But soon after the arrival, the first great success arrived.
With the acts of the Alliance, he deserved much by putting half billion euros on the course loss of this title in the London bomb proposals.
And that was the soldier - now he wanted more.
So long as you win, let's leave you
"This is like a snowball," he said to the police.
But the chiefs knew about everything, relatively.
"When I deserved money, the eyes were closed."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the great shock came.
On one day he lost a billion euro.
At a weekend middle of January, he wanted to compensate it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer employee of the Bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that she had lost five billion euros for her.
And how did they come to him?
He was convinced that he made himself through a vacation.
"I took only four days from the previous year.
A maker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to look at him in the cards," Kerviel finally said.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission in the last last last year were undertaken by nine development programmes through which the Czech Republic could reach 14 billion euros in the next years (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is not enough for the half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies can be assigned about 100 billion crowns from the "Innovation and Employment" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into the building.
The development programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Infrastructure Fund, which will be more than 90.8 billion in the next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme will serve undertakers and companies to win money for innovative enterprises.
This means that companies will win funds for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
Today, in the EU Fund's current money accommodation, the Czech Republic of the new accession countries shall be the least of the latest.
Nicaraguaan Court of Justice committed twenty-year penalty penalty for representatives
On Thursday, a professional court in Nicaragua was sentenced to the twenty-year prison penalty for the former President Arnold Alemán, which was condemned in 2003 for financial frauds of 100 million (approximately 1,8 billion crowns).
But later, he was released from prison and lived under home arrest on his hazienda at the Nicaragua Metropole.
Whether the former State overseer (1997 to 2002) of this Central American State is back behind the grid, the news agency AP says that it is unexpected.
According to the President of the Court of Procedure, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on whether Germany is allowed to sit his penalty home or whether he must be in prison.
A court reported four years ago that Germany had regularly moved the government's money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fitting, and the accounts actually belonged to his neighbors and the strongest associates.
Some of these money landed in a fund established by Germany for the financing of his election camp 2001.
The budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The State holding is approved.
What is the case with this household Bedheides?
It is the first budget that this government has rejected and which has been adopted without support by the majority of coalitions.
The current year was yet approved with the support of the CSSD (Social Democrats) because the Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted it, and the CSSD could therefore not allow it to reject it.
In the subsequent debate on living debates before voting on the disbelieving request against the Government, there was no dramatic effect on this time.
The lawyer's house was worthy of this traditionally little, but the most significant law in all silences.
This is a certain paradox.
It starts and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether or not.
The budget is a major part of the ­ but is covered by the government's power and opposition.
This is a more thankful subject for the media, and therefore they give him more attention.
A fighting is much more interesting for the public than the nearest numbers.
The State expenditure of the past social democratic governments have been subject to three deficiencies that cannot remove the budget for 2008 once:
The first is the higher share of debt committed by laws, not only to pensions, but also to social expenditures that have concluded the "admissive" coalition of CSSD and KSČM (communities) last year before elections.
The second is the budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.
The limitation consists of the depths of public funds, e.g. the budget of the Communities.
However, the greatest risk is not the State budget.
This budget is public and sometimes under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget of the communities.
Citizens have given additional sources for investment to be excluded from income from taxes, taxes and bank credits, often untransmissible debt claims for which they charged their advisory homes in excess.
In the past years, they were able to pay these debts through a massive sale of assets of energy and other supply networks that they received in the movement of the State's Implementation.
Now this source is already dismissed.
As we just keep on official and testable facts, we conclude that:
Our economy has already been a few years, such as the world, a growth phase, which the CSSD is glorifying without submission.
This was a single opportunity for their governments to correct public funds.
Instead, these governments committed the State more.
Other countries, except some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have economed much more understanding than our Republic.
This is a rice shame that is primarily to write to the former governments.
We belong to the countries that are threatened at least by poverty.
Therefore, there are no massive social programmes needed, which, unfortunately, have been overflowed in gigantic dimensions in the past years.
Even if it is possible to stop a part of the popularists that we have been forbidden this year before the elections, it is clear that if it comes not to a movement of the pensional age and to a pension reform, it is practically everyone in this country, and, exactly, who is at the power, it will not remain as a pure administrator.
It is simply easy to overcome if you say that they will be of government officers who share the largest part of tax income mechanically in pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's household cannot be a revolution, but only the deterioration of normal expenditures can be located by obligation expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns for 2008 would be overflow if previous governments had not issued what happened in the last years.
If we don't really want to make it possible to be pure of government officers, we must be patient and not all too strong coalition government, but it is aware that the State can only exhibit so much as he is able to enter into taxes and taxes in order to seek rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual implementation of a balanced state-holding expenditure.

Banks want to control the crisis
The Federal Reserves, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
Thus, more than 100 billion will be reached through aids to the wheel markets.
In these cases, the banks increase rates to which they are ready to carry on each other's money.
For example, the Ananian Fed sends 40 billion to auktion, 24 more makes it a locker for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time that the central banks of each State have been in the case of such coordinated action to decline, in relation to the mixture of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step will remove the greatest difficulties of the economic, so the lack of free capital that the banks can provide," wrote in a report to his clients Bernard Baumhl from the Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," added Baumhl in the report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion, especially in the United States.
Analysers expect more billion losses.
"The central banks must really have had before, which can even succeed when they have done this," said the Chef of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like that the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks have the preservation that if the banks themselves have difficult access, their customers will also be charged by credits.
This would reduce consumption and reduce the economy into a recession, possibly with impact on economic growth over the world.
The central banks have failed after they were not allowed to decline the LIBOR, the London Interbank rate, which will be used for money delivery between banks.
This means that the banks have continued to pay each other money, and that, despite the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom's central banks, they have decreased their rates several times during the inheritance.
"This will have the same effect as another decrease of the rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Agency Re日s said.
Some analysts believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the decline of the crisis because it is not the fundamental problem l', and the case of immobility in the United States.
Klaus: Ecological debates are incredible
Global climate changes are increasingly harmful in developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again said about the problem of global warmth.
The criticism has now been addressed to the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change on Bali.
In Wien, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he concluded that the debates of ecology were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which forms a rare mixture of government operators and such non-governmental organizations, but also the basic distinction between the ritoric they associate and the reality.
"The debate is not structured there, it is a word-feeding work that is only replaced for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President emphasised his book that it was very important for him and that it was so involved in it.
He also suggests his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet my views of care."
Now the interesters could read their position unexpectedly.
Klaus noted that he was not a climate, but he has his opinion in sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is academic, capable of understanding and evaluating fashional negotiations, has experience with statistics and also national economy.
As the main statement of the book, he emphasized the Themes that the climate continues to change and that its changes are, therefore, normal, that there is no coherent opinion between the economics that the impacts of the current changes are not too large and serious and thus no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of climate are overwhelming, uneffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, he views it as a person who has experiences with totalitary systems for inappropriate, other unproofed views, that he views it as an earlier restriction of freedom.
On questions of presents, he repeatedly explained that he is not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against military eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between intervention and appeal".
The same subject, Klaus in Wien had spoken in the Hayek Institute for two months ago.
600000 people couldn't change their leadership
600000 car vehicles delayed the time to change their old leader appearance, whose validity is the end of the year.
Today it is the last day you can make the exchange, so that the authorities can make it to make a new leader appearance until the end of the year.
The Ministry, however, does not ensure that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads after the new year without valid driving rights.
According to the authorities, those who do not want to carry out their leader appearance have not been able to turn out.
When small places report a strong decline of the interest in the exchange of leadership, the main city's owners are overwhelmed with applications, and the interest in exchange has grown this week.
The town manager runs around 2000 customers daily.
You have to stand for a half hour.
In Prague, approximately 140000 car drivers have not yet turned their leadership.
The exhibition of a new leader appearance takes 20 days.
But it is possible to fix the exhibition with a reduced period of five days.
In this case, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Car vehicles that do not create the prescribed exchange until the year-end and lose without a valid guideline shall cause a money penalty from January.
The carrier pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
But the police can also use it with a reminder for the offence.
In the case of a crime, the penalty can increase to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the community can also be punished that is not at all.
He could, so he called, a penalty of some 30000 crowns.
The Ministry has already invited the enemies to leave mildness and at least to put up a penalty of 1000 crowns.
The speaker of the Ministry of Defense, Karel Hanzelka, but no one can suffer a thousand crowns.
The leader appears to be a document where everyone can decide whether he wants or not.
It is not a personal statement that everyone, and if any valid, needs to be.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their leader appearance.
It is gene to bring him to the competent community officer or to send him by recording dorthin.
At the end of the year, leaders will not be valid between 1964 and 1993.
However, the cars must also change other types of drivers.
People with leaderships from 1994 to 2000 have three years of time for the exchange.
The validity of guidelines issued by 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2,6 million other leaders.
The Court sent penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
The former police officers Joseph Opava and Petr Koňarik, who were accused of making a joint thing with the bands of David Berdych, received 13 relatively 10 years of prison.
This dismissed in a rightful judgment the Prager Court of Oberland, which reduced their penalty for a period of two years.
In fact, the detectives of the "Agency for the War against Organised Crime" threatened 14 to 12 years.
In contrast to the today's judgment there is no professional opportunity, only a revision is possible in the Court of Justice.
Beerdych himself is also accused of this, but the first sentence is before him.
However, in other processes, he had already been punished for 16 years.
Moreover, he can't be condemned.
In January 19, a Court of Justice claimed, especially because of the share of raw transactions, that the Supreme Court today negotiated the vocation of 16 of them.
The most accused were from the beginning to the complaint with the ground, it was a constructed case.
According to the Intergovernmental Court of Justice, the police members of the Police in Ab日, including with Berdych, broadcast information from police sources, covering different raw accidents and helping the members of the band to distort the criminal persecution.
The bands left Opava and Royal Royal 30 Pro of the beet.
In the case of the accusation, the crimes of the bands from 1999 to 2001.
In addition to raw accidents whose victims often have suffered serious damage, but also official measurement and unlawful weapons.
In home investigations, the police discovered illegal guns, munition with steel kernels, a laser target and a machine patch.
The bands, according to the accusation, have been decreased by their raw transactions about a lot of million crowns.
Besides, nearly 20 men in this procedure recognized judges Berdych and a number of others because of other raw transactions, legally as responsibility.
Other men from Berdych's surrounding must be responsible in another process, other cases have not yet been in court.
The main negotiation has so far been held by Tomáš Pota and Maroš Schulej who are in the Irish prison and wait for the definitive decision on their delivery of criminal persecution in the Czech Republic.
Children expired - account: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a disconnection clinic, Igor Veleba, a lawyer of the damage parents, would like to ask for a hospital at Trébič 12 million crowns awards to court costs.
For each of the mothers every three million, for the fathers every two million, and for the children one million.
The hospital offers maximum 200000 for each parent.
The Legal Representative of the Hospital House, Ondrej Dostal, is therefore not incompatible with the proposal Veleba.
"On such proposal we refuse that it is too simple," Dostal said after today's negotiation.
"In order to make us a view of this proposal, we need the advice that has made the opposite.
We will find out whether it has a meaningful value.
However, we believe that this should be for everyone in hundreds of thousands of areas together," said Dostal.
The amount should be moved between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for each month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba was a basis for debates that he had for him the University Center House in Prag Motol.
Children’s parents, according to the view of experts from psychology and psychiatries, experienced psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men would better disturb the stress situation, even if they saw prejudices, they could have prevented the change of newborn.
The women return with the effects of the experienced trauma, as well as with what happens right now, Veleba fascinated the content.
Veronica and Nikola evacuated the past 9 December the hospitals of the disconnection clinic in Trébič.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Chermaks in Pribysla, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova to Jabloňov.
End of October, each family transferred 100000 crowns as a substitute for debt that occurred to them by the error of the hospital in Trebić, which is under the surrounding area.
All hospitals in Czechland are assured by laws due to obligation.
In the case of doubt, they must take a reserve fund, but they can only be able to assist the trainer.
The courts have equivalently granted lower damage amounts, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polivka came about his Kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight about the mark "Rein Walachei".
According to the Court of Justice in Ostrava, he first used the name "Walachischer King", but the project had built a team of Tomás Harabish in collaboration with the shower.
Polivka has not participated in the negotiation today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not finished, and his man will likely be called.
"The fight is that Mr. Harabish and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas," he said after the debate of Polívkas lawyer.
All were present in the words "Walachic Kingdom" just this shower and comicers.
The same opinion is also Harabish.
"We have almost a yearly job behind us.
Finance acquisition and concepts of the Assets," he said.
According to him, it's the emergency fight for money.
"Near the years they have noticed that the project is and that they could have something of it.
They want to gain parasite on our work," he continued.
Business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television sentences.
1993, the spectacular player Radoslav Brzobohati.
However, it was not at that time with the purpose of establishing a fixed kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came on the thoughts of putting wallish passports.
From an originally beautiful action, a business and an undertaking A's outcome, and the Harabis' establishment of the company "Walakish Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed with the use of his name and his signature in the passports and even offered their owners reductions in the practice of his farm and the theater views.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabish only used the only idea that the Polívka has published in the sending "Manege" for his undertakings.
"The Popularity of Polívkas has safely helped the project of the Valley Kingdom," said the judge.
But they added that the soul of the Harabish project and his team, which would have intensely affected him.
The cooperation of the today's disrupted parties has endured until 2000, when Harabish for Polívka in Vsetine organized the official crowning.
Since then, between Polívka and Harabish, the conflicts that were in the subscription "King Boleslavs I. selected until the day of Sankt-Nimmerleins".
The leader's role then took the Harabish Jarmila Shulaková as the king's mother in Angio.
2002 then Polívka against Harabish and his company introduces the claim that the Court has rejected today.
Clearness in the battle could bring the Harabis prepared legal battle around the throne and half princess.
This should be a new king.
He didn't want to deliver details and a date yet.
"We don't want to overcome anything.
It should be something like the royal summer in the Valley.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polívka is also strictly able to join it," added Harabish.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Previous
To say the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
His facilities were not very valuable, the quality of the gap, the combination and the processing could be considered as averagely.
But now his follower, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is about much better.
The combi with the SW label is still a piece, and I just remain to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic haâback of 207, for example, I had to accusate about the too small headfreeness on the backs.
These complaints are no longer, because the carossery of the combi is so done that they will not even suffer two meters.
Continue
I'm just going on the internal exhibition so that I'm not too much to repeat.
It's a quite learned design, where I'm only on account of the careful central tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more designer building, where the car makes a so elegant impression.
The seats are famous, and the times are over where we may be charged over too short seats or heads.
The content of the page has also improved significantly against the 206.
As regards the room offer, you can also see the increased sizes of the carossery.
In Combi, it is also removed of the deficiency of head freedom.
Coffee in the coffee room
The main thing on this car is the lader room.
I have to make it a very well-speaking and guarding place (a.k.a. because of the expansionable backsheet).
The hall rooms are equipped with guards representing an ideal compromise.
They don't smile, they can be separated and also keep more difficult objects.
But we're talking about the load volume.
It contains a table in the basic expenditure of 428 litres, which is a higher average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most-coated vehicle in Czechland, the Scoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we conclude that the Peugeot remains by 52 litres clearly appreciable.
This value is already critical for a foreign vacation or when a child car is invited.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still need to bear the very low lader space after the rearsing of the backsite or the very low ladecent.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a Vierzylinder-benziner motor with Hubraum 1,6 litres and a performance of 88 kWp.
And honestly, this should look like a 1600 cubic engine that takes a family hatchback.
He's quiet, has a little consumption and goes well.
If I compare him with opposite in Schoda, who sometimes acts as if his exposure was hidden with a laptop, I can only be disappointed by him.
The price list speaks bands
The price of this car is not just national.
But we must notice that we have tested a well equipped car with a spaced inner and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400er gas engine at 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine, it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already a lot.
The exhaust premium of the test car is replaced by 80000 crowns at the same time.
However, we had headfair bags, automatic climate installation, automatic shift wheel solution, electric window heavy back and and...
So the car costs totally 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but once calculate the additional installation of a fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar amount.
So there is only the decision that you want to choose.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is not a long time
In British schools, the number of children from the East Europe countries takes place, which calls for the inhabitants to continue the development of local school.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is still a number of obstacles.
British schools also set out cases where conflicts between the immigrants and the children of the original residents in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe to British schools illustrates in the case of North Kent, where the interactions between the Inhuman and Slovak Imigrants are significantly increased.
Conflicts, shops and rapeies among students are on the relationships between parents above.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham took a Slovak woman who had killed a year old boy with a railway.
The accused defended the boy with racial imprisonment.
The police also needed to attack two minor girls on a Slovakian immigrant after an attack.
The girls had probably made racial comments against the man and made him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy fell on a busy and shot on us.
When I told him to stop listening, he dropped us with eggs and birds and then deployed his seat," a mother of Slovakian students of the magazine The Times wrote another unappreciative event.
Consequences come from both sides.
One of the Inheimians was the fight against the immigrants in East Europe even as a survival camp.
The cases mentioned show that the vote between the homes and the immigrants in British schools is always more stressed.
In Greece, 70000 Slovaks were reported here to work.
So about 30000 Slovak students visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
It is actually an island of freedom for sugars.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, that will be fulfilled if you only choose the right.
Golden and white streams, high walls or a sea that is hardly like a tea.
Palms and All Inclusive with cells offering Pizza, Iron and cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the Caribbean Islands, you can find that in excessive measure.
Only on one island you find much more, and this island is Cuba, the biggest and beautifulst of the large Antilles.
At the Spanish time, Cuba was their base for America's recovery.
Columbus was called the most beautiful place that ever saw a human eye.
Havanna was one to a layer or cross-border of ships that the Spanish had dropped in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the Epoche came.
The National Hotel appeared at the end of the 20th century.
Build up one of the Mafia Mafia, Lucky Luciano, leaders, because everything that happened in the United States as a crime (although during the prohibition), was likely seen and supported on Cuba - ́, happiness game, prostitution.
Under his guests were it.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, high householders were growing over the wide boulevards, which counted the culture symbols of the fifteen years of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a presence in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and in Coyemar he had his jacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the showbusiness and more from all America left their signatures.
What about today?
At the walls of Havanna Bodeguita, you can also leave your autogram.
On the bar in the National Hotel, you meet Cocktails completely for you.
And the cool cars of the five cigarettes are running in Havanna until today, because the only imported shillings and fiats in the salt and hot air have been far away.
Mag Havanna, especially his oldest part, has been strongly disappeared, there is nothing to find so many wonderful colonial visions in the surrounding area as right here.
Other places are just outputed, for example Trinidad.
As the tourism offers urgently needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the past five years, new hotels have not only occurred in Havanna but also in Varadero, in the coast of Holguin and in the islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marotte that is unique in the world and is especially a railway lover.
The sugar roof of remote plants had dampf and the same furnished sugar trailers to the sugar manufactures.
Their car park has not been renewed over a year, and there are pounds and full functioning locomotives whose elderly associates are longer in the museum.
Exploiting targets
The most important places do not allow the majority of the cubes.
This is what you do not have to write about Varadero or Havanna.
Be careful only to realize that there is a Museum in Hemingways already used, which should not be allowed to be dismissed by the one who wants this writer.
The viñales number in the west of the island is one of the most malerous angles of Cubas.
The splendid vegetation w's on calk grounds.
The mogotes, calkhouses and fisheries, rained steel from the valley, gathered fruitful grounds in their hole rooms, covered by the spreading areas of your growth.
This valley is where the best Cuban Tabak may be built.
In his final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havanna's cigarettes.
Some may also appear to be interesting in that the Chilean result of the television series "Major Zeman" has been rotated.
Trinidad
A ural city, which was soon founded after the Spanish colonized the island.
Honour and richness made her trade with slaves and sugar.
The riches were covered in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, which has been strongly influenced by the later French sidlers, has never changed since four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray village, is a so remote place that there was no road that would have been connected to the other country in the fifteen years of the last century.
This isolation contributed to remaining unobserved.
Nothing was built there, but that's why nothing was cut off, everyone was happy that he had a cup over his head.
If you have more than a afternoon time for Trinidad, you will be rewarded to see interesting places in the environment, such as the playa Ancón beach or the "number of sugar manufactures".
On the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Musica, which takes the darkness, and where the music is not weakening until the morning.
Baracoa
This town in the East Cubas are some of the most beautiful island.
This view will certainly be influenced by the way of Dorthin.
Both streets leading from Guantánamo dorthin must overcome high and surrounded mountains and passe through a landscape that is not touched by human attacks.
This abilities of Kubas took up the UNESCO thanks to the worldwide involving nature in its worldwide book.
The best chocolate is produced in the church, showing the Columbus cross (in fact, it has been about hundred years after Columbus' trains) and from the hill where the ancient village, the current hotel El Castillo, is to see several tables from which El Yunque is the best.
About the coffee, the room, the cigarettes, the Sierra-Maestra village, the swinebook and the island Isla de Pinos, over the Tropicana cabarett, the sanctuary of the Cuban Patronin Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religion, to which the descendants of slaves, could be written over all of this.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Associates in Afghanistan are aware of Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of needed equipment affect the United States' history of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should, according to the words of the Defence Minister Robert Gates, develop a specific plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not pass according to their opinions, but the representatives of the countries who have stationed the units in the south of the country were agreed in Scotch Edinburgh.
Besides the growing opposition of the Taliban sides, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the United States.
As the United States called the NATO units to more A, by their defence minister Robert Gates, the United Kingdom views the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghanistan Government and in intensifying development assistance.
"In Afghanistan, a preliminary development is valuable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start the development of the economic and security," says the British Defense Minister of the Browne of BBC.
Ninety Pro
The A > of the Afghanistan's rebels has reached the maximum position for five years, according to the information of the Army.
The number of violences is compared to the previous year by 27 Pro, in the southern province Helmand even about 60 Pro.
The NATO countries have stationed approximately 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the United States have been put to an absolute limit in relation to the organization and equipment of units.
Concretely, they call for further shops, soldiers and experts to train the Afghanistan units.
"We will have to consider the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly, today the Secretary-General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan in countries and air.
We have approximately ninety pro of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and this is too short," De Hoop of the Agency Re Rébés said to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese Government in Tokyo.
Who's Educative
In the past months, all of the United States in Afghanistan also have a conflict.
For example, because of passiveness, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and rational part of the country," said Gates.
The British Boulevard period "Sun" this week included the German soldiers as a fool.
"Afghanick non-store discovers: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution added by photos German soldiers playing tissue.
The German photography went over against the attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a Rugby wet fight in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debts will be highly accelerated in 2009 to a billion
On each Czech, a state debt of 84,000 crowns falls.
The total debt increased to 842,7 billion crowns until the end of September.
The Government had planned to devote himself this year with 159,2 billion convictions.
On the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,8 billion.
The State debt of the Czech Republic reached 842,7 billion crowns until the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June they think about 13,4 billion.
The Financial Ministry thus informed its state debt from the beginning of October.
On each Czech, a debt of 84,000 crowns falls.
Over the past year, the State was charged for more than 111 billion crowns.
"Is it now seeming that we may be exceeding the limits of a billion crowns only in 2009 thanks to the lower deepth for the next year.
Next year the debts should be moved between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said David Marek, an analyzer of Patria Finance, to the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, it sees Vladimir Pikora, analyzer of the Next Finance: "To overcome a billion, we could come during 2009.
If so, it depends on the next household that we don't know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation is changed on the political front, and the more will be ready to save more, it could take it up until 2010.
But I'm not going out of such a change," he noticed.
Waiting debts
The State debt is due to the debt of the Government and is in particular from the debt of the State insurance.
The State debt shall be financed by estimates, state debt debts, direct contributions or, for example, by contributions to the European Investment Bank.
The country's state debt increased in the middle of this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The State's foreign debts increased by 1,7 billion crowns to 123,3 billion.
The so-called stateable debt has reached the end of September 803,3 billion crowns and has fallen about 13,7 billion from June.
The average case of State debt increased to 6,5 years.
"The total debt increased over the year from the first to the quarter of 13 Pro, which is actually much about the goodness of the economy.
It is interesting that the growth is especially in the debt records, where the growth is 20 Pro.
It's bad that the debts grow, but, on the other hand, it shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," pikora commented the data.
Better than expected
The Financial Strategy and the Communication with the State Debt for 2007 shows that the Government has planned for this year to take up 159,2 billion crowns.
On the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,8 billion krone.
This amount is in particular from the State budget, which is obvious of 76 billion crowns this year in place of the proposed 91.3 billion.
In addition, it is the maximum planned funds for the consolidation agency of 13,3 billion crowns, a tenth reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state debt charges for 43 billion and rates for investment in the European Investment Bank of 1,8 billion.
Because she has given a name to a tea boird, she has been sent to a court in Khartum today.
According to its advocate, the British teacher who was accused of the Islam Employment in Sudan was condemned on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum to 15 days of prison and later exhibition.
The Britin was accused to have allowed six-to-seven-year-old students to give a tee bar to the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic Prophet has been subjected.
She would've deserved to be exhausted.
After parents of schools had been charged several times in the Sudanese Cultural Ministry, the 54-year basic school teacher, employed at the University High School of Khartum, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Library of Islam's Employment.
In fact, this matter takes its start in September when the teacher invites her six-to-seven-year-old students to seek a name for the classant.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school leader Robert Boules.
S satt, when the class votes, 20 of the 23 children of Mohammed chooses as the lovingest names.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but especially a very common prename in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bar on it and the picture signature My name is Mohammed .
The ship himself did not have a gun with this name, but the problem is very simple that the presentation of the Islam prophet is considered as an inflammation of the Islam.
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gieban Gibbons, who teached at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well, and she had never done something that she could get too close to a religious faith, I would only endure that she had requested the children to vote for a name, his opinion is only an innocent error.
A view that the many teachers of the teacher share, who are very careful about their students and who never speak in the class of religion.
At the same time, the prename of Mohammed is the second most common name given in Greece, for which 14 different letters exist in English.
This name often selected by Moslem families applies as a kind of honor to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you, for example, give him a game?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
In the middle of the week, at the last negotiation meeting in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo have ended a sixth and last debate session in Baden, Austria, mid-day morning, without able to overcome their conflicts about the future status of the separatist province.

End of the Migrations on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which join the European Union, the United States and Russia, will take the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% of the Albanian provincy residents could be more clear if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian Promissor Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko provides their report to the UN Security Council until 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation session since the UNE had received the mission to a new mission from the Troika.

The Russians who have already blocked the authorisation of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council are outside a continuation of negotiations on this end date.
Russia was and remained speakers of a negotiated solution, a uniform solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral independence clothes?
After Kosovo has been under the United Nations administration for eight years, the western countries keep the independence in view of the EU for the only solution to the future.
Pristina is ready to announce them each other if the Security Council should not decide for their benefits.
Increasing autonomy
Permanently, no agreement could be met , the President of the Kosovo autonomous authority, Fat日 Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations were conducted since Monday.

However, he agrees that the plan proposed by chairman belongs to the autonomy of a past which has led to murder and deport.
Domini Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic, on his side, believed that a compromise would always be attempted, and the Albanian majority of Kosovo warned against the consequences of an unilateral independence range of the province.
Rad believes that it is especially a "domino effect" in a region that has been so deceived by the independence fight of the 90s.
For Serbia, that doesn't mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Thursday, the Serbian delegation concluded that each decision would be found unique and unique in the Security Council, where its Russian unions had a veto right.
Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia , the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica explained.
These negotiations have been due to two years.
You must end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalist answered Fat日 Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word regarding the status and that each individual independence clay would be completed from the sides of the Albanian people who are speaking in accordance with the western countries.

According to the State Affairs, the police are not responsible
What exactly is done on Sunday?
As always in this type of local messages, official versions and resources are against.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary of the Police (IGPN), a police car on the Rue Louise-Michel direction of Villiers-le-Bel was held on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours.
He had no use, but he was on the street, and he walked with 40-50 km/h without blue light, explained a police speaker.
A Green Motorrad of Marke Kawasaki, without authorization, so not released for the public road transport (see below), came from two youths without helm with very high speed.
It ran the left side of the police car after it had missed its leader from right, a police officer continued to explain.
The controls of alcohol carried out in the vehicles are very negative.
The state of the car (depthed cow flights, splitted wind protection ships, rised stones) results from the height of the wind.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the State advocate of the Republic de Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that the IGPN had granted an investigation on the "factors of the innocent person's murder and the failure of aid to persons in ́" in accordance with the main guide for public security of Val-d'Oise.
On the afternoon, on the basis of a press conference, the State advocate explained that the investigation of the IGPN at this stage excludes the responsibility of the police officers.
According to Magistratin, three witnesses of the accident, which were heard Sunday evening, have been organized the version of the police officers, namely that this small power road has reached relatively quickly on their left side.
Tonight, a kind of rillen, surely caused by the river of the footsteps on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were thrown together until the police were able to break it.
The vehicles have been captured and will be the subject of technical appreciation.
The body name of the two victims was obduction yesterday.
What happened after?
Last night, in Villiers-le-Bel, the police would have left the accident very quickly, and that, without allowing the two young people to help.
Although the IGPN remains fully careful, it would also exclude any serious error.
According to a police source, this is a weak aspect of investigations needed for further investigations, and it must be very careful.
Liberation has reached a witness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had direct look at the scene.
We're once with my kidney, the nurse in the hospital, going out to try to live again, told this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely covered policeman who hit.
Two more try again to live one of the youths who phoned the fourth.
In view of the spending which was rapidly developed about the event and, as it seems, because of the conviction that the present people had about the unexpected situation of the youths, the police were included in the car.
This testimony still states, the salvation forces met nearly 20 minutes after the police passed away.
You have also applied heart mass, but forgiveness.
I will not allow that the police officers would have not helped the young people.
These youths have been the first help.
The firewall came immediately.
It was done everything to try to save them, and the State official was stressed on their side.
In Pakistan, the effort is increased
On Monday, the Pakistanian police has decreased the first demonstration, since two days before general Musharraf has been called for the emergency.
According to the statements of witnesses in Lahore, at East of the country, approximately 2,000 advocates demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were deceived by the tree gas granates, which used the order forces.
They're laughing with stones with which they hurt the police.
At least 350 reports were temporarily established.
Similar scenarios were in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and hurt.
More would have been temporarily established.
In Islamabad, the advocates of the Advocate of the Master Court of Justice were invited to a general stage and announced demonstration, as a result of a whale of about 500 arrests of oppositional, defenses of human rights and advocates during the weekend.
Month morning, the streets leading to the Master Court of Justice were locked to prevent the congregation.
Other demonstrators would have found place in Multan (mitte) and Peshawar (Nordosten).
The advocate movement received the support of the religious parties associated in the powerful covenant of Muttahida-e-Amal, whose president invited the people to send the judges who had spoken against the emergency, flowers, and those who had made a swearing before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special action announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's election in a position in direct election on 6 October.
The Chairman of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was rejected and solved from his office.
All that we represent is illegal, anticonstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Magister Council of The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to submit the Supreme Command on Army and to become a civil president is not applicable since the call of the need, stated on Monday, the Viceminister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would deliver his military uniform until 15 November, the date in which his first official time was completed as the President.
The Vice-minister for Information has also informed that the elections could be moved from January.
The Pacific Government demented the detentions in the country, as the President Musharraf had assigned a place of residence by the representative of the soldiers.
More than one third of the pregnancy is still not planned
This behaviour takes into account the unrequired pregnancy (24%), as well as the bad planned or unprevisible births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuverth Guest, which allowed the prevention of prison in France, one of three pregnancy (36%) has not been planned, as shown by a National Institute for Demography (Ined).
This behaviour takes into account the unrequired pregnancy (24%), as well as the bad planned or unprevisible births.
The Ined appreciates that the various methods of receiving prevention such as the pile or the spiral still show a 5-6% degree.
According to the Institute, which determines that the continuous rate of pills consumers between 20 and 40 years that use the pile has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, has enabled the liberalisation of receiving preventives to improve the control of the fertility.
At any time, eight of the births were planned carefully today.
One of the five couples even calculates exactly on the month, and, if possible, the yearly time in which it seems to be a child in the first place.
Spe-culaire reparation at the room station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his cameras from the international space station (ISS) have been used more than seven hours in the world to perform the speechculary reparation of a defected sun cold sector that is uncomfortable to continue scientific work on the station.
A expected extent that has achieved several records due to its duration, the distance of resident modules, the disorder that he has been organized with, and the tools built by the astronautes to perform the repair.
The problem occurred in the middle-week when the astronautes had downloaded the Harmony Module from the space-free Discovery, a large cylinder-forming part that would soon take the → and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing browsing for the module labs.
But you need to provide it with power.
The second task of the occupation was, therefore, to implement a 17,5 tonnes of hard module for the production of energy over sun collective sectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After it had moved it, the restructuring of the sun-collar sectors of the module which is 76 metres of spans.
And there was a statement that one of the collectors that were allowed to be like a cordeone was charged by a locked cab on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring has been removed to prevent the college.
The astronauts, who were originally for control, should have left the space-free Discovery and then have been repairing another sun-cole sector whose rotation system was wrong, were forced to divide themselves to the protected college.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to space around to perform the repair at the end of the 30 meters of the remote arms of the rooms, which was set at the station.
He is one of the best spacewalkers of NASA.
Great, opponent, very sent, he has a well-developed top bodies and long arms.
The 46-year-old Ar'a was thus chosen to operate the lost sun cold sector .
After he had exactly used the damage, he translated the wrong-doing cab and confirmed a kind of shadow at the proper place.
He was supported by a second spacewalker, who stayed near the key, and, by drunk, by the other astronautes, including Peggy Whitson, commander of the occupation.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey shop, converted with isolator, to prevent the sun cold sectors that produce several hundred volt to prevent a electric shot, the astronautes had reached and built on the station board.
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the college was completely embraced before he was counting his tools and returning to the station.
Tomorrow afternoon, the astronautes enjoyed a half day repair before seven astronautes returned to the space-free discovery to probably reach back to the earth midweek.
The EADS title is sanctioned on the border
After the Aviation and Defence Group has announced that it must be issued between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros to affect the residues of the A400M, the EADS action now shows a clear decrease in the Paris Börse.
Currently, EADS loses 4% at 21.96 euros in Paris.
The group was forced to review their business prognoses for 2007 once again, referring to the losses caused by the only long-term development of the engine of the A400M, which delay the young flight of the flight.
The costs announced in October to compare the delay in the delivery of their military aircraft are between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros, of which more than one billion airbus , announced the EADS's mother concerns.
The EADS will be forced to announce new operational objectives (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its four-year results, without further details.
The group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is associated with the six-month residue.
Remember that EADS' business service was fallen from 86% in 2006, meaningly due to the delay of another programme, which is related to the very large aircraft A380, costs.
In fact, the group had proposed a first delivery of A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The selection of the Quo status
On Sunday, it will not be stressed when the urns are described: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's Party, the United Russia.
After a very broken choice battle, she has been working at its effort for stability, even by authors.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian President Wladimir Putin addresses a message issued on the public sentences to the electors, which have already been listed, but whose content is secret.
He does this in his property as a spectacular candidate of the United States of Russia, the Pro-Kreml Party for which he announces a greater victory.
The President did not see anything last night when he received the foreign boss and satisfied it to give a new point of attack against the western powers who are accused of the mixture - his favorite theme during the election battle.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope our honest choices, very transparent and open, elections without disturbance , and he is .
From the view of the opposition, they've seen it.
It claims a choice battle beat by pressure.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that it would never have given such a shameful choice, not even at the time of Eltsin .
After the pressure of the Demonstr in the last week, the ex-school master Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days of prison, advocate continues to prohibit.
The Russians have kept the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these parlamentary elections, two many further questions are addressed:
Who will come to Putin's follow-up as a president?
The Office has given the date of the first election of the presidential election last night on 2 March 2008; the candidates have the time to be made until 23 December.
Since he chose 2000 and was reselected in 2004, Wladimir Putin could not follow a mandate.
And now there's no follower.
What role will Putin play after march?
Prime Minister?
The President of Parliament's Majesty and all the powerful Parties of the United States of Russia will choose the Government and President?
Whatever it will be, in the Parliament or in the presidential elections, the power will be triumphed until now.
This is tradition.
The Russians have kept the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their shick salle, meaning the socialist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historic Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of Sankt Petersburg is still going back: The citizen society has been developed in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries after Europe, only very lately; the famous Community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
Following the liberal reforms of the 90s, Putin has linked again to the model of a patriarch, which was perfectly adopted by the population, even more, because this new pateralism was not a terrorist, but a certain economic welfare, Mary Lipman said by the Carnegie Institution.
Today, the Russians from free tracks are delayed to the personal responsibility they have put on the day shortly after the expiry of the USSR.
How longer do you think?
This phenomenon relates to all societies, the world of business.
And the administrative salite understands to keep the status Quo: 65 Governors (of 85 Russian presidents) introduce the local election lists of the United States.
The new freedoms from the west are often equal to Chaos, as in the 90s.
The generality prefers stability.
In this regard, the Russians will not even vote to the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year professional: for what long?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they resolve?
A Several One
After being treated more than 60 years of confidence, the Nazi archive of Bad Arolsen, which documents the shick sales of 17,5 million victims of Hitler regime, is now free.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which were undertaken at a total of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, were not able to be considered until now, except for a humanitarian purpose, so individual and named, so on question of an ancient victim or of his members.
On May 2006, the eleven members of their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them available for researchers and historicals.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening is valid since yesterday.
Holy Information
The access of historicals to Bad Arolsen will be allowed to carry out research, especially on the deport of prisoners, the insects of the concernation schemes and the health of the workers, explains Reto Masters, leader of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CCR).
In recent years, several States, including Germany, were to make these named documents available to the public on the basis of the heavy character of certain information.
For example, the common homosexuality or the spiritual prevention of some deportation sacrifices.
The insection lists of concurrence recorders or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo were composed of a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who were deported or undertaken by the complaint, and may provide them a evidence of their arrest in order to prevent them from taking the way to their detention.
Today, more than 300 fixed applications have been made in Bad Arolsen.
However, a part of the scientific Community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing of basic news in these documents is expected , Mr Wolfgang Benz, leader of the Research Space for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe has reached the 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is the main trade partner of India and is 18% of its external trade.
The trade minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian opposite, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hoped to submit a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's foreign ministers had given the European Commission a green light to open negotiations in order to submit free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Sweden-Asiatic NÃ© (Asean). The mutual trade between India and Europe has already reached the 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the first Indian trade partner and is 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also his first foreign investor, but the numbers of the European Commission are only the nine EU trade partners.
A free trade pact will make the two economic spaces enormous and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million Europeans, occupied by Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the most often exported products from India, the Commissioner continued to explain. The Asian and ­ Gigant exchanges annual goods in the value of 47 billion euros and services in the value of 10 billion euros, this week, Dôle `adja, president of the European Commission's Agreement in New Delhi, has been stated that the mutual trade has not yet exposed its potential. The EU and India are meeting their eighth diplomatic in New Delhi, with the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes the training to know and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England showed concern for the current renewable disturbance of the credit conditions, and a billion pound boat was announced with a basic rate of 5.75% for five weeks, a boat with an unusual time.
In order to decline the precautions which, according to the financial provisions of the year, will be particularly hard and to give the banks a greater consciousness about the way they are to organize their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank intends to provide a significant part of its stocks during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December , in the form of a open market operation for five weeks .
The Bank continues to explain that on 6 December, at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be circulated to the basic tax and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE in an open market operation liquidities for five weeks.
This is usually happening for a week.
The BoE should in its communication make it ready to take further measures in order to obtain the different rates of interconnected taxes from day to day with its principle.
The different inter-band rate between day and day was 5.829%.
The rate of three nights has reached 6,6%, something since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis from Somer, the sums carried out by the British Bank have been linked to penalty taxes that the banks had stopped to take them in charge.
According to certain currencies, strengthened by the development of the rate of the rate in contrast to the euro, many are expected to sign for the sums which the European Central Bank has encountered, to increase the rate rates and with safe discrimination.
UMP and NC refuse to check the PS proposals for purchase power
On Thursday, the UMP groups and New Centers refused to discuss the articles of the socialist legislation for purchasing power, which cover the text.
The text found in the framework of a socialist nine (the initiative on a parliamentary grouping) was not enough to adopt measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS at the middle-week of 50% of the majority of employment added to the TIPP, to the reimbursement of the TIPP, to a transport check or to the limitation of funds.
After voting against the examination of the article, UMP and NC were voted (180 votes against 115), the meeting was resolved after the main discussion, which had too partially appealed words between majority and opposition, a few hours before the TV contribution of Nicolas Sarkozy over the purchase force.
The leader of the lawyers of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of its proposals as a amendment to the legislative provision for the correction of the funds, which was examined last week by the Assembly.
A new festival is born
Following a number of currencies regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelowe by C3 Presents, the Promotor/Produ · the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Federal Republic of the British Product Melvin Benn.
It is a honour for our company to work together with a person who has, not more and less, served an example for the current festival movement in America, shared Charlie Jones from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 makes the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer target for camping facilities.
The festival will be located from 8 to 10 August on a 500 large farm of 500 Acre about 40 minutes from Philadelia.
The leader of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, previously called Mean Fiddler, is one of the products of the most renommated festivals of the world.
1989 he adopted the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually approximately 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn© Portfolio added the Leeds Festival, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn also cares for the production of the license conferences and the organizational tasks of the Glasstonbury Festival, which can be taken up to 177.500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, the Glasstonbury described as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been with, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work in parallel to offer the area a festival event in the style.
We have chosen Philadelowe as a market and worked diligently together with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city of Philadelowea, mentioned by Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and disappointed on this project.
During time, we remain in Political Debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Freely we could discuss with Melvin Benn and we meet preparations to create a great festival in a extraordinary place that will finally benefit the population."
C3 Presents raised the Lollapalooza - Festival 2005 in Grand Park Chicago again to live after it has been in 2002 with Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of Festival Profiles.
The two events were able to gain $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million for breakfast.
These two festivals are located in a local area.
"The model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, but the ours are better located on the City Green Places," says Charlie Jones.
"The goal is, in one or other way, to mix these two concepts together, to submit the impression of a rural festival on the eye and the state of the Ananias."
Vineland is in the middle of the way between Philadelia and Atlantic City.
"The Community of Vineland, of the citizen master, takes the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
It refuses to price the conditions of the convention, but he asserts that they are quite interesting to invest in such a event and to establish a festival that hopefully will have a long life.
Charlie Jones says that the capability of the festival is "very large", in approximately 800,000 people at Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennessee corresponding.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be done yet when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer a smacking rock, but the music will be very much-speaked in hope of locking all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who have received the top Inde't Promoter Price of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.

Is the bridge a final year-Rally before? Unity in experts due to the US hypotechnical crisis
With at least five weeks till the year-end at the border, the investors have already seen their hands in view of the future end-year Rally.
However, experts can not create safe prognoses about this.
Banif believes that it is clearly considered statistically that the month of December is normally involved in a positive market development.
In contrast, it is not rare to create a short-term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if the current market event is to be taken seriously.
Although other experts do not make such a strong growth in the last weeks of the year, they notice that the rates currency is determined by the market and market shareholder's liability. These investments are importantly affected by the pension funds which are highly affected by the current trend to achieve a significant capacity.
As a result of these experts, it is more likely to demonstrate a higher side effect of market disorders, especially because we are not able to evaluate the measure of the possible reduction of the rates of the US notes bank, a uncertainty which is, in particular, to the higher rock oil price and to the increase in the inflation rates.
Javier Barrio, President of the BPI Section in Spain, agrees that it is a expected time to announce an advanced market Rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert's assured.
The Spanish Action Index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum mark on 8 November of 15.945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, Anal, in Intermoney, Ibex 35 could conclude by the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional, each year, the exchange of pension cases for the year, with nearly 16,000 points.
However, the expert pointed out that this year the things could develop something different, especially because of the second week of December, and then directly after the breakfast day of the Constitution, the end-year Rally.
According to the analysis, price fractions would not affect market denses.
After assessing the Federico Olucha, Anal, at the Bank Inversis, the preliminary market assessments are available at a nearly technical level, which could lead to a decline from the index values which depend on the impact of the US hypotecan crisis.
The analysis trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values that Ibex will be used to make new maximum values, the analysis agree.
Solana of Intermoney claims that this year the large values are in the range.
In addition to the value winners, the expert would count the two large banks and some immobility companies, since the energy sector will be too higher at the time given.
In this case, Federico Olucha assures the Bank Inversis that the increases in connection with the bank and industry sector will be introduced.
If the Rally actually occurs, the immobilious companies will benefit from her.
In the last months, we hope that other immobilious companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same way as the expert.
In relation to increased consumption behaviour during the Wednesday, the market occurrence will be determined in the last half years of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that also the technologies will achieve positive change results, even if they are represented only in smaller number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, the December only showed courses in two cases.
At the end of 2003, when the technology was located, this resulted from their crisis, and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 prospectpoints, in December, showed an increase of 6,68%.
If 2008 the fifth winning year will be followed (the Ibex increased by 8.36% since January) and can also show a final year, it will be shown.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from Montgs to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of his holdings.
In total, 200 of these are included in the most economic regions of Spain.
For the Institute that operates under the name of Popular Max, these delays mean a great milenstein.
But also for the rest of Spanish institutions, since Popular as the first group of banks is waiting for the spray to extend the opening times of its weeks to 20:30 hours and to set Saturdays from 10 to 20:30 h.
The BBVA banking group, who also renewed the prolongation of its opening periods in the reductions, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the businesses seem to be determined to agree, where 75% of the weekend will be closed and opened on a week afternoon, even though not for the knowledge.
If additional banks of the new initiatives adapting the opening times are attached, it will depend on the experiences of the Popular Bank.
And this is also the purpose of the people to follow their project.
It is aimed at extending the opening times of those areas, which may be able to recognize the purchasing knowledge of individual, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also of large buyers.
The Bank wants to open the 200 new branches during the coming 18 months because it is not new, but changed opening time.
This is why the Bank will transform the spaces of those deficiencies already in business areas and compare them to the individual customer profile of different zones.
The extension of the opening times is thus linked to a new space building of the areas which are being used by a more colorful design.
The competent bank accountant Angel Rivera assures that restructuring does not require greater investment, but income with an increased personal setting, since a holding has no longer been six, but eight or nine employees.
The reductions, which are even equipped with additional spaces for the MME, will not exceed financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine in Madrid.
And the experienced values fell positive, such as Angel Rivero.
The discharges of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Do and the Gran Via have been selected for what seems to have been a smart decision.
Popular is currently running about 2500 Nederlassungen.
And more 60 operating under the name of Mundocredit. These are specialized on immigrants and also indicate extended opening times, even on sun and festivals.
In these areas of PopularMax, the model of the BBVA will not be used because most of them will provide a wide selection of non-financial services for sale.
We don't want to present competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With the telephone, they have temporarily come to the agreement to overcome mobile phones using external bank staff.
The Spanish Telecinco doubles its value for the first time and thus overcomes its Rival Antena 3.
We've done it.
With this set, the business leader of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, gave his satisfaction at the end of the bridge. The sender led by him had his value to increase the dual of his Rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, murmured his joy: That's exactly what I'm hurt; not that we have a growth, but that we had less losses, he fixed it.
He noted that, despite the weak market, they were not too deep.
Telecinco ended yesterday with a plus of 2,54%.
This winning reduces its until this year loss to 15,66%.
According to Bloomberg's information, the company value now reaches 4.488,88 million euros, where Mediaset controls the main share of capital (52 %) and Vocento is only shared by 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 has lost 1,52 prospective points since January and has reported a total loss of 40,5%, so its market value has been extended to 2.193,46 million.
The market value of other bass noted communications undertakings increases; in cases of sogecable to 3.571 million, Prisa (explainers of the Cinco Días) to 2.518,53 million and Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be rejected from the fact that it is about two similar companies as Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question is still shown in which area we can actually act in the case of the price and how we can make it lucrative at customer levels.
Telecinco explained that a week ago his preservation was to rise to the first television sender this year with more than 1000 million Brutto wines from public income. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, the business leader of Telecinco and Publicespaña, the public company of the group.
If the prejudice should be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising in comparison with the 965,4 million from the previous year by 3,6%.
In the case of Antena 3, the net range increased by 1.6% in the first nine months (to 4.4 million), while the net income from television work could only show an increase of 0.7% (63.4 million).
The main factor for the improved trends of Telecinco, compared to the high Payout-Ratio, which the company could show until the present time: 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevaria had a 100 percent of divisions.
Vasile, however, ensures that the ratio after purchasing 33% of the parts of endmol, with mediaset as a mother company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official notification.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have already given more significantly.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose asset values we could already increase by purchasing 33% of the final molecular shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing some loss density.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its benefit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction of the expected growth rates, which will be reduced from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected winning of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 Options.
1st
Ibersecurities: put on its high efficiency funds and its sustainable potential and therefore recommend the purchase of both actions.
2nd.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (coppers) missed due to the multi-fold incentive and prospering market a more advantaged position than Antena 3 (holding).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to repeat expectations in both cases in the light of similar threats (saturated market and bader economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the Directive of the MIFID which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallelly to the Parliamentary Development, which has been completed today with the Congress Decision in the Senate on the draft additional and amendment requests, the Government published the provisions of the new law with the aim of ensuring the entry into force of both rules until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies honoured the efforts of the Congress and Senate lawyers who had pursued the goal in their negotiations and votes to establish the best possible scheme that guarantees the security of investors and regulates individual undertakings to ensure such a general efficient market event.

▪ The entry into force of the Directive on legal limitation of the work areas of diplomated economic scientists was adopted; 30 years after 1977 the regulation, which restricted the workshops reserved for economic scientists, was adopted.

The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) has increased about five decades in November and is now at 4.1%.
The Eurostat indicator to evaluate the inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication corresponds to the basic rules of Eurostat and of the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek a location and quality comparison to US products through the notification of data.
The prognoses for the indicator can be created in time by applying the same procedure as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time uses other statistical modeling methods to evaluate the information not available at the time of the beef.
However, the Spanish Statistical Court (INE) suggested that the previously recognised indicator should only serve as a direct value and therefore does not comply with the final result submitted on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the President of the Government and the Economic and Financial Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI was a temporary development in November; at the same time it assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relative high level in the next months.
However , solbes in the congress building Halls claimed that even if the current number is not good , the inflation difference of Spain to the other members of the election Union remained more or less equal in the last years.
He explained that in November there were less surprises than in the previous month, where the government did not consider such a high increase.
We expected a value of approximately 4% , and the Economic and Financial Ministry gave the present public prognoses.
Virgin calculates more than 42 billion euros in the next three years
The values of Northern Rock have been acquired of more than half after the Bank in the mid-September of the past year had requested the British Note Bank for a needed credit, and they have only 12.000 million pounds (this corresponds to 16.800 million euros).
At that time, the bank's capacity values are 25,000 million pounds, a sum which has been significantly distorted by the loss of confidence of customers within two and half months, and despite the hundred-procent guarantee of the Government that the money is safe until the end of the crisis will continue to be reduced.
The Virgin firm, which would continue to carry on the group after the adoption under the Market name Virgin Money, has to bring a quarter of the income of the British banks that will be collected from the installations of the next three years to gain exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The group of the multi-millionary Richard Branson, who is in the United Kingdom, is about 50,000 million pounds (approximately 70 million euros) each year in public and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock called this week the Virgin Conzern, where three other companies are shared as his preferred offerer to lead it out of the in·nz.
The citizen master of Totana has been arrested because of a disadvantaged decree on participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police adopted this morning the current citizen master of Totano (Partido Popular), the city of the city of Murcia (Partido Popular), on the basis of the tremendous decree on development in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
One of the Secretary-Generals of the Communities and the Chairman of the Community Police was adopted.
José Martínez Andreo passed by May the Office of Juan Morales, currently the Deputy of the Partido Popular and at the time president of the Community of Totana, and may be, according to the information of the Cadena SER sender of the original drafts of the completion.
The officers continue to investigate the business records of the Community and the Ministry of Civil Planning and do not exclude further prisons in the next hours.
The lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the main conviction to discover the case of urban corruption at the beginning of this week.
According to the Cadena SER , the lawyer of the ©ar, and thus privileged Members Juan Morales, were found in the case of his man's residence on the basis of important pressure documents to be related to the completion.
To report other sources of information from the assembly payments of morals to a galaxious building undertaking which intends to conclude a town-building contract where the building of a 200 hectares has been concluded with a large area.
Eight people are currently in investigation.
Bono agrees to take place the PSOE candidate in Toledo and, in case of a choice, in congress.
The former Defence Minister José Bono has adopted the Board of the Government President and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, which will therefore introduce the list of PSOE candidates at the coming general elections in Toledo and, in the case of a election of socialists who take the office of the President of the Congress.
As a result, José Blanco, the organizational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference, has been announced after a meeting with Zapatero at the main seat of the party today.
According to the Governing Board, the Board is justified to the former ministers, because it is important to count the best and Bono is among the best.
In the case of a victory for the socialists in the coming elections, it would seem to be the president of the Congress for the Partie.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, which had announced that the next general elections would no longer come to the end of his car in the public and use it in the University of Climate Protection.
The former Minister must have concluded that the Government President had continued to return to political events since two years ago.
Moreover, he noted that the party, as the Vice-President of the Economy, would not want to predict the citizens who would take the posts of the President of the Congress as a act of transparency in the case of a election.
If he should actually take the office, he hopes that the room is in a house of respect and not in a position or in a vote to allow the citizens to appear more likely.
Permanently, from time to time, the impression is as if the only place in which you cannot speak hardly and leave in Madrid is the Congress; so the Governing President in the Senate has been interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his work and said he would not want to resurrect the appearance that the office had already been taken, because otherwise his political opposers would be arrogant to this.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debates both the skeptics of climate change as well as those who put a social and political debate in the context of this matter are subject to an unlawful criticism, the movement must be a strong cohesion.
In particular, if it is a leader of the movement, such as the President of the Government Zapatero, the fight against climate changes is more important than the conflict of the Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new Treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings it into consideration concerning the operation or non-handle of its government, which has decided to make Spain standing within the EU at the top of countries that have at least fulfilled the conditions of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for the non-residence of the conditions to which these sectors are to be rejected, and why his government, which proposed the Treaty with the Planet, did not distort this development.
He has now been forced to make the Spanish citizens the measures he has made against climate changes without change.
What companies will be concerned about what the behavior of the citizens should be changed, which individual and collective spending measures should be carried out and what economic impact they have.
Exactly said who must be sacrificed and will be paid for the salvation of the planet.
However, there will be no such statements in the future.
It's just because it's about the sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be applied to climate change are inconsistent.
They are free, inconvenient and threatened for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the benzin center proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero was selectively seen in a strategic manner that he was forced to resume the proposal.
Therefore, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty word without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, the Commission, issues, protocols and new issues.
With its contracts with the planet, the other must not speak as appropriate for election campaigns, nor be accused or requested, but rather follow the appropriate department, to disturb the meetings and to please others with his sanctuary and kindness.
But this can only happen if the Treaty doesn't decline from its pure institutional nature, and then does not predict that the driving road will be futurely to the only road movement or that we can only refresh ourselves with a fibre.
The citizen master and the police officer of Totana due to a constant development in a citizen-building corruption.
The Guardia Civil adopted the citizen of the city of Totana in Murcia, the local police officer José Martínez Andreo, and the Secretary of the Civil Ministry, and a hotel undertaking because of the cruel deceit of urban crimes, it was today called from investigation circuits.
The City Council was established at the residence, from where it was held to the Community officials, and in its spaces he was at the present time, circumcised by a number of agents who were also joined in the State administration and the municipal building of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three decisions related to the last months in Galician, Murcia and Madrid, where more than 2 million hectares of incomplete building for urban projects should be transformed under the leading of the Galatian Construction Forum Nuaria, which should be established on the basis of 4000 apartments after the local administration has reached illegal provisions during the latest legislation period.
At the same time, two other persons were not directly arrested, but an investigation procedure under which the first Court of Justice of Totonas was authorised and carried out.
The first six prisoners have been sent to the judge today.
According to the statement of investigation circuits, the former citizen master of Totana and the currently independent PP member Juan Morales is determined.
Moreover, his ex-fair, inhaberin of a real estate in Totana, as well as his current friend who lives in Murcia, is under the dead.
The Chairman and Inhaber of the Nuaria Group, a lawyer from Vigo, and undertaking Manuel N.A., was established in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the business leader of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company was working as a part of Nuaria and had to receive the payment.
The investigations shall be carried out by the Communal Authority against urban delegates, in view of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives accompanied the arrests, and the majority of them in companies who were directly identified with the arrests found in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was found in Totana: the holder of a regional flight aircraft that would have been acting as a mediumman.
The Nuaria building group was ordered to create the largest residence complex of Murcia's location; this should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf place and two spa hotels.
In Totana, the company produced more than 2,2 million quadrimeters of areas that could be built. The objective was to achieve a building project, which would increase the population of the community to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar who promote the sale of immobility; Conyase, which is in Vigo the parking places of the roads of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; the hogartel, whose activity is restricted to the direct marketing sector and preconiza, especially on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can make

I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you have been invited to introduce your proposals.

Our Phinetic Correspondentin explains us the most important physician journal, Helsingin Sanomat, a comment (Finland is also at the top of the PISA ́e), which refers to the position that was published in the same magazine on 18 November; at the time that the issue of the book Blackburns was critical.
The content of the philosophy has become the school of Jokela Theme of the public debate after the tragedy.

A colleague informs about the introduction of illegal internet downloads into the penalty book:
A. Download of a song would be a legal break that will be taken into account with six months of prison.
However, if you renew a musical business under a value of 400 euros, this is only a simple deterioration (Article 623.1).
B. If you exhaust the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the steel will be tested as a penalty test, however the penalty is less than at a download (Article 234 of the Strategy).
C. If you listen to a car and return it 40 hours later, the punishment is still less than at a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to share in a shopping range than to a music data exchange.
A prison penalty of three to 12 months after itself (Article 154 Criminal Act), while the data exchange has a freedom of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Act).
E. In accordance with Article 184.2 of the Criminal Journal, sex behaviour is considered less bad than downloading a DVD from the Internet.
F. The trade with copyright films which have not found authorisation by the author shall be excluded as the distribution of pornographic film materials to minor years (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, somebody has made his requests very well.

My householder gives me one of its long, strange research articles with the title: money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.
So the feelings of the monthly payment are dependent on the content of the colleagues.
The results were published in the latest series of the periodic period Science, using a tomographic-magnical reference analysis at the University of Bonn.
According to Bernd Webers, author and director of the Bonner Header Research Space Live&Brain, the activation was the most strongest when the participant gave the right answers and divorced his partner.
The researchers could recognize that the brains were always very moderate if both participants had their response correctly and then received the same content; but if one of them received the double, it also came to a stronger brain.
I am not very sure if it really requires so many scientific intentions to achieve such a result.
The State Affairs from the Balkan
Carla del Ponte has been inhabited for eight years after the crimes of the Balkan War. Its office is located in the State of the Café of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Its mandate will expire the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and laughing eye, since the main responsibility of the massager of Srebrenica - on the eight thousand bosnish muslims - namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serb-Bosnish leader Radovan Karadzic are still on free foot.
Their names are listed by the Governor Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a model for the title of his documentarms La List de Carla (2006, still not in Spain); a film that follows the Swiss State Affairs of Rule to New York at its pre-show, tracks the outcome crimes and puts the respective governments under pressure, so that these networks may intensify.
What insurance is best acceptable for me?
The KFZ insurance covering one of the potential damage caused by the driver includes a high cost increase, which depends on the extent of age, generation, date of creation of the leader appearance, family status, type of safe cars and its use, etc.
It's just the beginning to allow a car.
Because it is even weaker to find the KFZ's strict security than the correct vehicle model.
For one time, we must be aware of what we have to do here.
A car insurance is a agreement between an insurance company and a insurer.
This Agreement shall be established in writing through a insurance contract, which determines that the company receives the approved insurance premium and is binding, in contrast, to present the corresponding amount of residence in the case of a damage.
The insurance premium is the price of a insurance that is combined by several holders, including age, sex, date of creation of the leader appearance, family status, type of vehicle to be assured or its use.
The insurance undertakings shall fix their prices in accordance with statistics, so that contributing payments will also be eligible for an accidental conduct.
Therefore, both over 25 years old and women must give less contribution payments, since statistics show that these groups have a less accident rates in their view.
The same applies to married persons, as they, according to the statistical values and then, after the conviction of the enterprises, refer to less accidents as singles.
The benefit of the vehicle is affected by the frequency of the driving and thus the probability of an accident.
More often use, more likely of damage.
When the premium is set, the insurance must take into account a series of points.
That is why the driver also needs to study the situation based in order to choose exactly the car insurance that is in the first place of his personal needs.
We are now listening to the most important points that should be taken into consideration in the selection of a assurance, not only to make an efficiency but also to make a price-oriented choice.
The under 25 years of age shall take place in the choice of a price-benefit insurance on numerous obstacles such as the small driving practice and the young leader appearance.
Even if it would be best for an ideal security to complete a full-case assurance, there are even more price-valuable alternatives.
The supervisory drivers can choose a full caco with self-partition, thus covering the performances of a fullcase insurance, but are offered to a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay a part of the amount owned by the damage.
The amount will be defined before the end of the Treaty and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is less than the amount to be paid, explained by Luis Noguera, the main representative of Spain in the first Europe, a online insurance undertaking.
Another option is the extended insurance that assures the clients against external accidents, but not the damage occurred in their own car.
This type of insurance would cover the steel, the fire and the loss of vehicles.
Here's a Council.
If you are less than 25 years old, it is in the hand to reduce the insurance costs; thus your writing increases by trying to walk carefully and avoid accidents.
A document is a decline of the base-fire in the respective insurance company.
In contrast, a penalty payment includes a claim of tax.
The height of credits and penalties depends on the company and their income.
If the company has an exciting year behind it, it can allow you to increase the bonus rates , Noguera is not allowed.
As long as the 25-year-old mark is over, it is easier to conclude a contract for the drivers. This is why it is the fact that the accident is decreased with a reduced driving practice.
Thus, it is most important to decide for a full-case assurance with self-participation.
Of course, young people cannot benefit from their experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of the driving , and the Spanish leader of the company, and the majority of accidents will occur in the second year of practice after the starter has been released.
However, there is a married customer who does not have children, which is more advisable to conclude a full-case insurance; of course, only if it is allowed to be the financial situation of the person concerned.
The insurer's sides apply to marriages with children as customers with the lowest accident rates, and therefore their contribution payments are also lower.
In this case, a full-case insurance would be the best option (at a amount of EUR 300). If you have received a high record, an extensive insurance is recommended to be used only for the vehicle year.
They are driving a larger purchasing force that allows them to set a strict contribution payment , Luis Noguera defines.
For the Rentner, it is proposed to conclude a full-case insurance with self-partition (with an amount of EUR 150), or an extended insurance that is only used in a sufficiently high document.
Finally, it is necessary to note that the car security is something very important, not only because it is the driver against possible accidents, but also because it offers high costs that require a fundamental choice that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glassgow hopes in Mayland at the point of the eight-final
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glassgow will be fighted on Sunday in San Siro for the point they missed to achieve their respective objectives before the Championsleague forward. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while this decides about their participation at the shots.
The Italian community has already taken five points and have already participated in the fifth division with an unexpected in Portugal, while the Celtic Glassgow with nine points needs another to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not include the Lisboa with four points.
The two games of the group D will find a week before the end of the sixth game round, since the FC Mailand has to arrive at the FIFA Club Wolf Mastership in Japan, where he will be fighting the first time at the 13th half-final on the final end, which is located on 16th.
This group will be completed before all others and the unexpected result in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion, even if both teams are trying to win. In fact, the Italians will not speculate homes, the Keltik Glasgow wants to know that they would be in the case of a vice grouper and thus have a better outcome position in the 8th final.
The company of Gordon Strachan could even have enough downstairs at a sleep of the FC Shakhtar to qualify himself. However, he should not trust too much in such circumstances, because in nine points of equality, Ukrainians were to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Maylands will try to avoid the shots at the evening. They hope that for the second time the octal finals of the transformed championsleague will be reached after they were visited in the previous game season at exactly the same range by a gate of Kaka in the after-time (1-0) and by a zero to zero unexpected on the game.
As the FC Shakhtar waits for the winning of the Rossoneri, the community will have to be able to play itself, since both the achievement of the 8th final and its membership with the EUFA from Sieg and a delay of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the view of continuing to participate in the largest mastership, Lisboa could enhance the victory and thus participate in the EUFA.
200,000 people visit the first concert of Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave in Canada the Vancouver before the eye of 200,000 spectators of the starting court for their first tour after the band was solved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the beginning of their concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the votation in the reunified band was excellent.
About the 200,000 people were able to meet the concert at the exhausted station, where a video of the history of the band, which had been shown the end of the ninety years of Furore, was shown.
The reconciliation and the world tournee are overwhelmed by the publication of a new album, which includes their largest hits and two other new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, and that appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls took on the boat of golden armbands that the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, had given them before.
The sporter was among the fanmases in the public that the GM Palace was to please, although the nerves of his wedding Victoria had prohibited him in the past days.
With the preparation for Schow, Victoria Beckham allowed that the British Star hasn't seen our gardenobe only one time, and therefore I'm very stressed what he's going to keep from the rebellion.
Sporty Spice , whose exhibition from the group in 1998 due to internal opinion differences two years later, followed the resolution of the group, was two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shot.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And therefore I thought why not; so I am glad that I had taken this decision, Chisholm expressed the trend of the band that she had left for nine years ago.
The song also made it possible that the conflicts were deleted and that all were very pleased again.
However, many things have been changed since the last common attack of Spice Girls in 1998.
Once again, the group joined the CTV report in a special machine of the Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received from a soldier from children.
The five have seven children together.
After the Concert in Vancouver, the band will come next in California, in San José (4 December) and in Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
In Madrid, they will come to the bowne on 23 December.
New wars on earthly gas combat between Russia and Ukraine
A new price strike between Ukraine and Russia, which suggests that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe are affected.
The largest part of Russian agricultural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is led by Ukraine and every fight between the two N.E. is very accurately observed.
Kiew warned that if Moscow has to pay the price for the gas, it will be taken into account by Russia's transit taxes.
A previous conflict between the two countries reduced deliveries in the EU countries last year.
The youngest fight between Kiew and Moscow is at a time when the Ukrainian Government and the Russian, State Gasmonopole Gazprom are trying to make an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian landgas in 2008.
Gazprom states that Ukraine must be calculated more, since the concern agreed to up to 50% of adequately for the land gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40% more for the imports of gasprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states," said the Economic Minister of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the News Agency Re Réès.
"The changed earthquake prices should certainly be related to our arguments regarding the height of transit taxes [in Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last large earthquake fight between Moscow and Kiew, in January 2006, short gasprom delivery in Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which drasticly increased prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has developed the worldwide most gas advanced, but many of them are still developed.
The consequence is that Gazprom added its own provisions with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet N.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Spanish State Health Service has to improve the controls of the prejudicial rulers for workers outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland in combination with the attack on the aircraft of Glasgow in June.
Black also mentioned that the Scottish State Health Service has no exact idea of the number of his foreign workers.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were correctly carried out in a test of five health participants.
The main financial controller examined the staff, recruted outside the countries of the Economic Ra, according to the attack on the aircraft of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28th, a Iraqian doctor at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a landing car was driven by the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who occurred in a video transfer in October in the Old Bailey, and was charged in relation to the cruel car bomb attack in Britain.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out controls in order to ensure that they authorize the necessary qualities, experiences and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although health participants use Disclosure Scotland to check prejudicial records, the Agency will not receive such information outside the United Kingdom.
The report of the Main Tester now states, besides other recommendations, that the headquarters of the Strategy Committee should take place, helping employees to control in different countries.
"Although we have found indications on these controls in some personal documents, these were not routinely carried out." The report stated.
Black said that the Scotch health members would follow their investigation guidelines in a high measure before the introduction, but to add: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Schottland president Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extermly unlikely" that research would identify the possibility of NHS partners who could take future terrorist attacks.
"In the report it says that the current preview tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what additional value the recommendations will be provided," he said.
The Scotch health auditors say that they have now 1.161 foreign workers, the major majority of doctors and sisters.
However, the financial controller warned that the number would be probably, even because the situation had problems to identify those employees authorised at an unusual time.
The investigation continued to conclude that the established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glassgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were highly maintained.
It belongs to pass, work authorisation, and qualification controls.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its own and guidelines for controls before the start of the establishment of foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was a suggestion to perform this work in the light of the terrorist attack on the airports of Glasgow."
It added that the Scotch government, in relation to health participants, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines would be repealed in the field of control studies, including those from the outside - their publication in the next month.

208 arrested in Saudi Arabia due to a terrorist complication
Saudi Arabia has discovered last night that it has established 208 militaries for their belonging to cells that had planned an advanced attack on an oil plant, as well as on spiritual and security forces.
The state TV of the worldwide largest earthly oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to switch rackets.
Sympathisants of Al-Qaida have started a campaign against the Monarchie, which is a United States union since 2003, followed by the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight military, indicated by a foreign citizen, plants an attack on an oil layout in the province, after the television report.
Saudi Arabia has made a 35.000 men strong rapid income troops to switch after a misleaved Al Quida attack on the world's largest oil processing installation in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial declaration, states that 18 of the prisoners belonged to a cell led by a "Raket expert" who was illegally immigrated into the country.
He reports that the Militarians had planned to enter eight projects into the Kingdom.
More 22 of the prisoners had the report forwarded to the execution of spiritual and security forces.
The Government has warned more to do in order to stop Saudis, who strive to support the milisions of Al Qaida, who want to combat the allied fighting forces and the schitical muslim government under the United States, which is considered to be the Czech of the Hardliners under the Sunnith Saudi.

Among the prisoners were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the Millians.
The climate on Venus could demonstrate a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may have been a pleasant place for life once he said last night.
The data of a space rubber that exists on a roadway shows that the planet is still more like the earth's declined dulling than it was known until now.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have the same size and have similar planet trains, but the sun's Venus is something closer.
Millions of years ago, Venus would have ruled on the conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even be residents today.
However, because of the most impairment effect of carbon dioxide trend, the erosion of the atmosphere through sun radiation and a longer rotation time, the Venus introduced a whole other development course.
Today, the planet of water is beau and has a surface temperature that is heavy enough to swimble white and is devastated by Hurrikan-storm winds and fuels.
The recognition of the Space Sunday Venus Express of the European Room Travel Agency, which has investigated the plants for a year, offers a refreshing point of how the earth could develop in the light of disastrous climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It will be clear why the climate on the Venus is so different to the earth, while the planets are very similar."
"Our new data enables to build a scenario, where the Venus has started a billion years ago, like the earth, perhaps with a resident environment."
"Assuccessed Uran" was arrested by the police
A kilo radioactive material, reported according to a sufficient Uran, was arrested by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police speaker said three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
He didn't confirm whether it was a sufficient Uran, but he said that it could be rebuild for 1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
With Romey he said he was not worth a presidential candidate to be asked by a snowman.
However, the Republican Candidate for the Presidency was ready to put a debate on YouTube, to take questions on the normal electoral video and to send it to the candidate.
No of the questions raised on middlewoventh, on 28 November, were as smileful as the snowman, the democrats on the global warmth in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected exactly this time the state of the Republican Partie, which is in the elections in the next year.
It is not, exactly as the products of CNN, who supported the debates with those who chose YouTube Clips to show the approaching candidates.
Nevertheless, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest issue was given to a single subject, immigration remained centrally.
The subject is one of the most powerful issues for the Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of unexpected electors to serve a electoral box when they heard things that they had to them: The television board noted the points of approval as the candidates spoke strictly over the borders.
The worst and longer exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who went before in the decision-making issues in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to break the call, he was nagious about illegal immigration when he was a citizen of New York.
He attacked Romeney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts to have appointed illegal immigrants for work at home.
The two questionnaires particularly questioned whether one of the candidates would have a "amnestie" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of the State citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congress Advocate, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress Deputy from Colorado, followed this subject.
No one of the two men has serious chances in the nomination, but both remain in the round, perhaps because they have kept on the immigration pauke before and worse than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share the same views in large and total: the decreasing limits, the intolerance against illegal migrants.
This theme, together with an elderly over a toxic game from China or other concerns about the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
However, the debate was obviously difficult than other subjects to the language.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported weapons restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated instruction should be considered as folter.
One of the questionnaires asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This resulted in Giuliani’s view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not believe the story of Jonah and the Wal.
Another questionnaire asked whether Jesus would be subject to death.
Mike Huckabee - now all expectations occurred in the first place in a recent investigation in Iowa thanks to his existing Christian conservativeism since long - said that the death penalty was painful, but needed.
When he was pressured on whether Jesus would make them careful, he laughed about it and said that Jesus was too smart to apologize for a political office.
The run remains extremely open.
Huckabee growth in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul's youngest successes and his attacks in the middle-week debate.
These two have been shot from nothing because the two flights of the party were not yet able to be on one of the more and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincedly associated with a vital message about the size of America and a winger to the two flights of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is not clear.
Labor party pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another gribe to income; his way out of this way remains the same.
For the British scandale, this is not especially swimming.
No adels Title seems to be disappointed, no Pariser hotel paid, no extraordinary shows have been lost.
But the discovery that a rich businessman Sõ for the British regional Laboratory Party has disappeared over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has dismissed to report this would be something without that Gordon Brown would have come well.
Since the President had decided after a choice two months ago, the British intellectual intelligence in a depth way, he claimed that the issues of opinion had not affected this decision, it was hoped that he would offer a strong, efficient government.
Instead, such as Vince Cable, who has developed the only fearful Brown of Stalin to Mr Bean, in the same manner, the representative of the Liberal Democrats.
The unseen salvation of Northern Rock, a attacked bank, showed regulatory weaknesses and bad judgments under decisions.
The proposals for amendment of tax law have made business associations against the Government.
The tax collective loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unpredictable administrative powder.
A trio of generals in the rest of the rest started a rebellion in the home of protest against shortages of military expenditure: to be a minister of fighting forces, so they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many range of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours General Secretary (and its former heritage leader) has already returned.
It doesn't mean that Brown's unrepealed direction is going to delay.
However, governments can get a turnpoint after which they are unable to govern.
They don't like any trusting people, but they usually keep their sceps back when a new troop receives the office.
If it is evident that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister improves the situation and does not need to be there for a long time, this exhibition is over: the public service begins to become, the Cabinet Ministry begins to pull; the press is looking for bad news; and the government will be defensive and unnecessary.
In one way, Brown's position is especially difficult because he cannot be a new position, in contrast to other political leaders.
So he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his masterman.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax competence records, for example, are related to decisions taken by Brown as officer of the Financial Ministry.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blairs Missgeschicke - such as in the long "Gold for Adels Title" search for political parties' financing - the electors may find out that he was.
However, Brown's situation is not so bad as she seems.
The failures are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died or has been completely disappointed.
And the opposite, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's natural stalinistic trends have always promised: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new view of political Sõ is an example.
The Garboeske Abraham, who compares his sctus with his favorable gifts, does not want to recognize his will.
It may be like that, but the decision was not accepted to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contribution payers are clear, and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who said he had known about Abraham's agreement, but not that it was illegal, will certainly have to ask for some questions; just as Jon Mendlesohn, Labours' main financial operator, which was told about the responsibility of the Supplement in October.
But until now Brown is not shared: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his office in June.
The Prime Minister has done the help of the work until now.
He quickly condemned the damage of the laws by his party, but he denied this deceit by means of the adjustment of a rational instrument, leading an investigation committee to the subject - to complete the measure, by a Bischof in the rest and a judge.
In this case, the "learned teachings" are not very complicated.
When the law has been violated, it's a thing for the police.
On the contrary, there are other things that Mr Brown must do to find a permanent president for the independent Committee for Standards in the Public Life, which has been unemployed since six months, and to predict a transparent reform of political parties' financing.
This would require the hardlines of the Laboratory to cooperate with the conservatives and may be the special financial relationship with the workshops - bitter pills for a party member such as Mr Brown.
But he should be conscious of some partial facts.
Conservatives now have a clear guide in the opinion issues; he has two years to win for electors; and the only way he can win is by inappropriate justice and solid power.
Cards
Does the credit crisis accept American credit cards?
When the blood is in the water, it is only natural that back flows are surrounded.
Now where America's immobility is broken, the raub animals have the credit cards of the country in the visa.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs calculate that the loss of credit cards could be achieved by 99 billion if the covering of subfinanced credits is spread in other forms of consumer credits.
The signs of the stress are clearly visible.
There are anxieties both in the exhibitions and in the rates of shame that measure the share of the credits which are not too intriguable or too late than 30 days.
In the last month, the HSBC announced that it took a 1.4 billion rental from its consumer funds, partly because of the weakness of credit cards.
However, it's too early to get in panic.
Losses and sodiums are still low.
According to the Rating Agency Moody, the third quarter seaming rate of 3.89% was almost a full prospective point under the historical average.
The injury in the Council may be explained in part by technical entities.
An amendment to the Ananian legislation in 2005 resulted in a disrupted case of concurrence notices that renewed a large part of the credit card losses; the number of registrations (and thus deductions) would increase whether the general conditions for credit providers would be deteriorated or not.
The industry also reports of solid payment rates that show how much of their debts pay consumers every month
and confidence in credit card papers is pretty strong, despite the rest of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research undertaking, calculates that the quotas for 2007 will be 25% in the last year.
Direct infection channels between the immobility credit crisis and the credit card are certain: it is probably more likely that consumers take credit card debts now that their own private credits are expired.
However, the card issuers look at the money flow placed on capital values, therefore the cash prices are not necessary to make a change in the creditability of the crediteur.
You can even be beneficial for the card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to sell hypotechnical rates are deceived if the immobility is less than the value of the loan; as a result, the card debts will be more important under the payment priorities.
Card providers can also respond much faster and flexibleer than credit providers to the more steam conditions by changing rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a quick revaluation of the asset values.
"We will not wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main funding reporter.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable discovery are significantly more real.
If the lower house prices and a reduction of credits in America in the recession, the industry will certainly stand before a more wrath future.
Keep their looks on these fish flows.
British linkers are committed in the case of Enron
Three British banks, which should be presented in court for their role in the brutal system with the former main funding leader of Enron, Andrew Fastow, in the middle of the middle-week, changed their search.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally seven cases of disturbance using telecommunications to conspire with Fastow in a secret financial disorder in 2000 to discipline themselves on the costs of their employer, on unschuldigly.
The procedure was established on January.
However, during a audience before the court of the US District Director Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone planned for a case of disturbance in use of telecommunications.
The three former forces of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were held in Britain in the course of delivery procedures due to two years.
In the United States, their case is a loss end of an investigation started after Enron's breakdown in 2001.
The original accusations imposed against them in 2002, Fastow noted that he was the goal of an investigation of the Government in relation to Enron.
The accusation against the bankers - called the "NatWest Tri" - claims that they were coming to Houston in 2000 to exhaust a fashioned complot with Fastow and Â former Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a daughter company of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a number of enron facilities that were able to drive the company into the concurrence structure.
Starting 2002, the Bank had appreciated the value of its share in the daughter company at zero, but the three British men knew that she had actually a significant value.
A company under Kopper's control made the shares of the bank in the daughter company for 1 million.
The bankers paid the header 250,000€ for a share in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely denied Enron that the energy company would sold 20 million € to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the daughter society.
But actually, the 20 million people went to the British Bankers, Fastow and others.
The banks received 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and other about 12.3 million, stated the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow has been committed in two cases of denunciation for his role in the Enron's fight.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a six-year prison penalty in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is a three-year penalty and one month in a establishment in Txarkana.
Each of the three men was on free foot on the basis of a 1 million of accusations, which caused them to live in the United States in the expectation of the court procedure.
Enron, the largest enterprises of the nation, in the concurrence in December 2001, after years of bookholding tricks could no longer be able to reduce the billion liabilities or defective undertakings.
The summary destroyed thousands of workplaces, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion pension plans.
The Enron-Grunner Kenneth Lay and the former President Jeffrey Skilling have been condemned last year for their roles in relation to the enron collection break.
Skilling is a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lays' sentences for injury, disorder and other claim points have been distorted after he died last year because of heart disease.
Not completely below in Moscow
The price of an aeroplane of the Marke Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough real estate to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million.
But this is a little pay for some of the rich Russian.
"There offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But no one of you asks so many sits because it's for a family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream at the last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, a four-year-year orgy consumption, which was made in a devastated exhibition center at the main city border.
Finally, to Gulfstream, more than 200 other Luxus providers have built exhibitions to hope to interest new Russian in all, from Maagoni-developed yachts to diamant-over-passed car grills that would be added to 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a glassing orange porsche at the next measurement state in the visa.
"This is a beautiful car, but it's a little payment compared to us," he said.
"Near the United States Russia is the second largest market for flights."
In the light of a oilboom, the Russian capital seems to be overflowed with money like Dallas at his time.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic riches and went to Europe, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a professional at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Sections at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab overflows of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are the most visible freedom of money issuers in the world.
The most exclusive luxe marks are looking for their share in the Golden Rush.
Anderswo in Moscow, this week a Conference of Luxus industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, has made a conference to exchange ideas about how high-prise goods can be overcome on markets such as Russia.
(The International Herald Tribune is organized by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion, totally 282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
Moreover, 103,000 Russian millions belong to the second class, which are worth 670 billion together, as a result of the development of capacity in the former Soviet Union, which was written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15,8% of the Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - so we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of the sale and deal of David Morris, a London Juwelier.
She first had visited the messe with the Russian Marker, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplaryly bound, and the men are all worth a power."
As they walk in the dinner clothing, they have two immobilious machines, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, themselves and their clients as a million.
"I've looked at the cars and I've tried to decide between the infiniti, Mercedes and the porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the design clothing she dropped, like a root-teppich veteran with Joan Rivers.
The messe seemed first to go to the news, the type of march-conscious Russian buyers that would be ready to stand for several hours in the stage to visit a suitable storage house, which unfairly set Cadillac Escalades, the platein boxer, Mövenpick Eiskrem, maxed billiards, apartments in Dubai and Gund Tee bars.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57日).
"The Russians are interested in learning what mark is the most precious and best," said Mr. Gijrat, who patrioticly sat in a state of the Netherlands Portal Launcher Royal Delft before a widely large imitate of a hand-maded, blue Mosaic Steens.
Of course, the Russians are more interested in clippers.
In fact, the sellers say here that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years) have already moved from great-speaked logos to the type of nearest marks with limited numbers that would not be in a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousands of people, whether millions, and missionaries of billion or simply tourists, were driving through the Halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil bed here, said that he had two 70,000 × Matratzensets, made up from seed, kasch ́ and woodwool, with one-coated gold feet.
Similarly, in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sale manager for A1 Moto, said that a company has installed high-end cars with high-ended alarm systems that his company has acquired the grill orange porsche for 170,000 to a Russian billion.
By Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, said to a company that adapted Luxus cars to customer desires, he would have acquired three car coal grills for a Royce Phantom Rolls, which were equal to the chair arms connected together, for each 55.000.
He showed a reporter a carryer that was developed for a Russian Casino owner with speechs he had over-- with colorful Swarovski cristals, so it looked like a rouletterad.
The costs: 22.000; for a quarter.
"The Russian billion, the streets leader or a picture of his wife's vision from Cubic Zirconium, will not be able to go on these discussions," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40-wagen garage."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian Millionary" would now not express a lot of exclusiveness in view of the increase in the price of hithern immobility.
"If you have bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already a million, at least on the paper, if no longer in bargain," he said.
"There are more than you believe."
Those who were not billion could at least do so as if they were rich in a position that was carried out by Alliance Continental, a Russian power management undertaking.
The company had set four red phone cells according to the British example, which were completely stopped with mountains of false million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the director of the company, said that his employees would have printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millions of people.
Patents continued to run the money heads, mobile phone photos, while they refused to kick from friends, or simply to cut a few million.
"See, everyone in Moscow can feel like a billion," said Mr. Karryev.
Deceived operations in the case of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the festival as Ronald Livingston through the big glass window of Just a Little Healthier restaurants here and watched as a hospital car at the white Cape Code holding two doors below at West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police officer.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the box car of your body viewer come", said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, in the middle of the week.
"This was the point when I knew someone was dead."
The audiences experienced that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was a assistant of the Newark police officer.
Now the investigators are trying to figure out whether they died because of a procedure that was carried out by a non-approval, cosmetic chirurg, which was not identified by the police, and who is in the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet discovered what caused Mrs Arroyos death, and they are hoped that toxicological studies whose results could not be available for weeks will help to discover a mysterious death that has sent a tremendous by the Newark Police's leadership.
Mrs. Arroyo was a assistant of the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was many in the Department.
"You were loyal, hard working and hard-leaving," Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview at the middle-week.
"You were my pitbull.
She's hurt me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former newarker police officer who was for the alcohol control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stive daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the State lawyer of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the experts would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unapplied, chirurgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's a running investigation."
The authorities said that they had come to the house about 3 hours after the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs Arroyo on a sofa.
She was explained to death at the place.
More than one week has passed and the authorities have notified a little about their investigation or the owner of the house listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't say if Mrs Castro was asked by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was sufficient as a medical practice.
In the middle of the week, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a black rosen stretch is in the front garden button and a Dalmatiner swallows behind the house.
A blue fass named "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for Vanille in foods and parfs, sat in the parking place next to a door that led to the underground.
Two Mountainbikes gone from haken on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time, after he had delivered 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable value and helped him to find in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"He said, 'You have to look at this or that eight," he said.
She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I went.
It was painful."
Hope that the Central Bank will reduce the rates to increase the world activity markets
The actions went to the two sides of the Atlantic last night after market opening that the Central Bank will try to fix the credit markets by further rates, strengthened by the Vice-President of the United States Central Bank.
The actions markets ascended in London, New York and in Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the president of the Central Bank, said that the dictionary should respond "flexible and pragmatic" to the standing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to sustain disturbing markets, on the basis of signs of increasing credit stress, the cohn said that the youngest turbulences would have "in part some of the improvements of the market functions from the latest part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further deteriorating the financial conditions for consumers and companies.
The comments were recorded by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is ready to enter and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital in the US markets and more possible rates.
The exhibitions also helped the Wall Street to raise on the basis of further bad news from the United States, now since the sales of US immobilies reached a new record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulences have been underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they are 650 workplaces, or 4% of their worldwide employees, will be removed in a measure to reduce cost reduction in order to compare serious losses from their lost weights in the US hypotechnic credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts will be disappeared in London, where the Bank is employing 1.500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrie Index sprang by 331 points, or 2.55 Pro · to close at 13.289,40, while the widely set S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 Pro.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, or 2,7 Pro, to conclude at 6,306,2, which is added to more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
German Index Dax increased by 2.6 Pro · and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 Pro.
The recycling of credit pressure was previously underlined on the markets, following a strong request for a increase of the European Central Bank's credit funds, which were granted to the European Trade Banks, at least 4,7 per cent, the maximum rates since April 2001.
The pressure on the bank of England, the United States Central Bank and the European Central Bank and the introduction of further capital funds in the money markets in London increased when the credit rates were seen by the three-month "Libor" boards of the UK banks with 6,59% at its maximum since September late, after a constant increase since 21 November.
England confronted with decisions on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to shoot as number 6 for England in Candy at this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a larger context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral president, at least under this special title, is here to help the Chefriner Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vhalthan, and because the table of High Morries, the English Business Director, makes requests for national electors, if not even for which parttime.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth rate position will be unfortunate, but the life is often unrighteous and the sport is uncertain.
It is never easy to fix exactly what a man allows to get the top of his professional students, while someone else never comes out over the lowest range, sometimes from lack of happiness is ability.
It is not only in the crisis where the choice is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time to get up to Bopara?
Is it just to Shah when he does it?
The same may also be asked in another area if, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young driver forces, should be transported with exceptions that are well known to the business.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, except that it will be given to him the opportunity to weep or go down.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but the opportunities also have this.
Inside a team, a cricket player needs to catch the eye of the captain at the right time when he can take a wicket and a shop must have regular chances on the order if he wants to be a single cricket player.
The capture of the Selector's eyes is more complicated.
There were many better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who seemed to play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison himself explains for health and how the wind goes into the network.
Anderson took 32 first-classed wickets with each 33 °s to deserve a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same shadow average, but both had their points and hoped more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the stadium of Asgiriya, it can be only a view question.
The choice could decide the career of both men, or it may make a little undershade.
For four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful, however, Paul Collingwood was still fighting to establish it, who created the crossing to a significant test cricket player, and who, although he doubled a hundred against the points in which it was, maybe still be underestimated.
It is probably that Graveney, V¤Han and Moores, after a further discussion in the current network session in the Agyria stadium, their conservative instincts and feelings for Shah will follow greater experience on Bopara’s youth enjoyment.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, he speaks his functional and valuable 88 test debt innings in Bombay, 43 first-classed hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years older, and an exciting bie's against the touched bottles.
But Shah just made 日s in his two innings in May against West India in the test in Lord, his hometarina as a player from Middlesex, and this, regardless of his immediate delay from the electors as Vhalthan, was healthy to keep his position back for the next game, seems to have taken the weight out of ­ Schlagen, which was yet manifest in Bombay.
On the contrary, the university officer from Essex is probably enjoying life.
He was not imprisoned by anything on a crycket place and his attitude was unfortunately brought to the point when he had recently overthrown a vehicle with a quarter operation in an exhibition for England's Sponsor Popss.
He makes smaller damage and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his wodaphone (otherwise sponsor) and call his team colleagues Alastair Cook, who had observed this from the remote, and saying, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he kicks his medium time with some effects here on the game fields, which seems to match him with confidence and confidence.
Choose the right man is a thing to choose the right time.
Maybe this is the art of the selection.
I refuse to give Bopara now his chance, which doesn't mean that Shah may not be good to happen when, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqian refugees came to Bagdad yesterday, with a flow of translators whose money or visuals have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some even returned to fight the rebels they had destroyed from their homes.
At Busbahnhof Mansour, even before the arrival of 800 people from provinces in a official government convoi of a duty of buses, the terminal was operated with refugees and Jordan who were returned to transports.
"I decided to go after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," Sabah Al-Qubisi, a sunnitic ar.
"I came back today because of what I saw in the television and what I read in the magazine, about what happened in Bagdad, and how safe it would be now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, in relation to the milisions of the military Klerikers Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered to restore his powers at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old skit teacher from the great Sunnith part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his syrical visa and because the Iraker's regime was not allowed to work.
His shit neighbors in Amariyah invited him to tell him that a local, supported by the United States, has appealed to evacuate Al-Qaida from their bassion in the west of the capital city, and forced him to return.
One of the new campaigns from Jordan was the leader of a healthy and schitical tribe, which was destroyed from house in Sleikh in the North Bagdads by an attack with handgravates after he asked his fellow citizens to cope with Al-Qaidas.
He was back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaida milis in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my boys.
That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
They told them that they had been locked by the late rest in the capital of the United States Groups since the increase and growth of local "groups" citizens who were armed and defended their city quarters in cooperation with the military.
However, more of the facts were made to be forced to home through Visa problems and decent money in cus, where more than 1,3 million Irakers were left in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general deceit among the exilants that Nouri al-Maliki, the skitical President of the Syrian Government, had requested to impose visibility restrictions for the refugees to force people back.
More than two and half million people are probably of the sectieral death squadrons in the country.
"We went well to al-Maliki'en and the government forced Iraqi to give no vision anymore to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunnite Rentner.
"I can't believe a government supporting the criminals who burned my house after I went away."
A part of the reason for the decline of violence is that Sunnites from Science residents and around were destroyed, which led to creating many places where spending has been left.
There are wars that a sudden addiction of refugees will re-scale sectieral spending and will come to conflicts.
Small Saarland, Education
The smallest Bundesland is leading in the training, even with the international orientation of its high schools.
Only in a educational field, the Saar countries are the same deities as the country's.
"I have" yesterday to 50 times a non-saarland explains that we are not French" - this Slogan places the smallest federal country self-ironically to 50. Birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a great role in the Saarland Education System, which is located in the overseer of the German economy of Köln (IW).
This is how high schools cooperate from tradition with the neighborhood countries.
The University in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, there can be a double or even triple diploma.
It is therefore high that the share of foreign farmers is 15,6 Pro.
However, the landscape also brings the Saarland into a average number of high schools - many of them without a conclusion in Gymnasium.
"In Saarland you use the famous educational system," says Axel Plünnecke, IW educational expert.
More than every fifth youth will have its rights to be at a professional school, so the Saarland is more than seven points over the average party.
In addition, the combination options of famous and academic training are also strongly developed.
Measured by the population number is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing requests, however, the number of engineers in the past years has been sought about a third.
Therefore, the Saarland Education Ministry has now committed the high schools to a marketing campaign for engineer scientists.
"We have made a number of reforms after the first Pisa study," says a speaker of the Ministry of Education.
This is how the Government conducted comparative tests throughout the country.
To begin learning the children earlier, the last year of Kita is free - a model that copys between other aliens countries.
If the performance of the students continues to improve, future comparative studies will be shown first.
At Pisa 2003, the part of the risk students broke from 29 to 20%.
However, in total, the Saarland has not increased as strong as other aliens.
The Bayerns are thinking better.
And in the past of the Saar countries, foreign opinions in Pisa will not be done - in this area, you might be able to point otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbors is responsible for Gymnasia - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chavez resumes the hours
In Venezuela, the hours are deep, different than in the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez allows the timemasters to return in the South America country for a half hour.
In Spain, Chavez will then be to the witzfigure.
As reported by the Office of Venezuela, a new law sets the hours at the world time at least four and half hours.
This is what the South America State has a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The United States Enemy Chavez founded its decision, among other things, that the United States of the World had set up the department in time zones to time.
In addition, Chavez announced in the middle Week (local time) because of a geislafer, the interruption of relations with the neighborland Ko
The link nationalist said that while the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Coöpyia, he will neither be discussed with the Government or with the Coöpian Government.
"I can't do this alone because of my worth," said Chávez, who has a constitutional reform forward, on which the citizens of Oilanda must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would clearly build his power in the country.
The soldier of the fight was the decision to remove the mandate for negotiations with marxist rebells in Coobieia, in which it was to be released.
Uribe had thrown Venezuela with his decision "in vision," Chavez criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain is Chavez in all the world.
A new phone-klingelton provides in the country for Furore: "Why no te callas" (Why don't you keep the mouth) is the set that has already downloaded more than half million people from the Internet.
The Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was generated on the youngest Iberoamerican rubber of the continuous intercalcation of the linker and was driven through the mouth.
Germany drove 2007 Lohnmins
Despite the strong conjuncture, German workers have a predict this year a loss of real salary.
Experts called a whole band of reasons for their pessimistic prognoses.
According to a construction of the Hans Buckler Station, employees in 2007 could actually calculate less on the maintenance account than in the previous year.
"There are the moderate loan development, the increase of additional taxes and the price practice in food and energy," Gustav Horn said from the Institute for macroeconomy and conjuncture research of the "image".
New loads may also be made to workers in unemployment insurance.
Financial Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrück Journal", the planned decline of unemployment insurance to 3.3 Pro ́ for annual exchange is right and reasonable in the present situation.
However, the Federal Agency for Work should not return to the opportunity to ask for credit or assets at the Bund, the SPD policyer was quoted.
On Wednesday, price explosion in food and mineral oil products increased the inflation rate at the maximum level for 13 years.
The prices increased in total in the annual comparison of 3.0 Pro.
Venus is the höeish twilling of the earth
The Venus, despite its vital enemy atmosphere of the earth, has been thought more like that: The "Venus Express" space Sunde has discovered in the atmosphere and the wind winter in the Poland, as they appear in the winter also on the earth.
Since almost three years, complaints believed that it was on the Venus.
Now the sun "Venus Express" has made evidence - she looked on electromagnetic whales at the border of the atmosphere: The ́s shoots on the Venus in a height of approximately 56 km from the cloud to the cloud, Christopher russel from the ́ of California in Los Angeles in the "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursup-theorie" that the life on earth has been raised: Weathers must have made reactions in the Ocean that lead to the education of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early story," said Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there must be almost something alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about 100 times closer to the earth, it rules under temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil willing of the earth, but it's a twilling," said Russell.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has inflicted a so completely different development, is the basic question of Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milenstein for the Venus Research, since since the beginning of the nine years there was no longer a soldier to investigate this planet.
The latest research results presented in several "nature" articles are not only supported by researchers in the view of the uniqueness of Venus within the sun system.
"They also show that the communities of our neighborhood planet with the earth are greater than accepted," the Esa shares.
So the researchers found a cloud stream in the southern pole close to the already existing wheelwind.
The phenomenon refers to air streams on the earthly winterhemisfere, writes a research campaign on Giuseppe Pi^oni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The two-thirdest planet of the sun system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost like the size of a diameter of 12.100 km.
The plane also covered as the morning or evening in nearly 225 days around the sun.
But he turns a lot lately around himself: a Venus day takes 243 earthly days.
Although the Venus with the surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar is unexpected to the earth, both planets have occurred under very similar conditions.
On both sides, water that remained on earth in Ocean, but on Venus was lost in the world room.
And while cold dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbonage stones, it produces the majority of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Cooler defends mark meetings with Dalai Lama
President Köhler requires the end of the party fight for the receipt of Dalai Lama in the office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD because of their attacks on the office after meeting in September.
President of the Federal President Horst Köhler cares for the view of Germany and invited the great coalition to end the fight for the receipt of Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the foreign world in this issue a collected nation," Köhler said to the trade table.
Similarly, Köhler understanding for the receipt of Dalai Lama by Bundesconcern Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany needs to have sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President pointed out, but he took the marks in protection from the proposal that it operates a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Concern has not taken away from the traditional in-Chinese Policy.
It also knows China," said the cooler.
External Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had expressed indirect immutation on the receipt of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by a series of Unions.
Steinmeier, among other things, had complained the Union's "group window policy" in the external policy.
After the receipt of Dalai Lamas in the Office, there was too strong irritation in German-Chinese.
The Chinese leader has thus not only invited the German Financial Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but also requested the so-called dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
China's Governing Boss Wen Jiabao has now invited the Federal Concern Angela Merkel to make the receipt of Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China teaches that if more in official function receives the religious leaders of Tibeth, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The facts and words of Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to remove Tibet and the other Tibeth region, including other today's provinces, from China.
Sheuble warns against crawls like in France
Road kills with police, shoes, burning cars: Wolfgang Schüble warns against crawls like in France.
Everything must be done so that social incompatibleness in Germany would not be in violence on the street, the Federal Ministry requested.
Barrikaden, Randaliers shot the police with shoot flints: Following the severe youth crowds in France, the Federal Minister Wolfgang Schöuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to be sure that we don't even build social disorders and are in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young man comes to the rapid change of social reality.
Bund, countries and communities have already been pressured to deal with problems, said Sheuble.
This is not only the integration of migrants.
"From the integration of the islam conference, the first success is already shown."
However, it is too early for warning.
Sheuble also pointed out that in German preferences there are no urban and social problems like in France.
In the northern fronts of Paris, youths were delivered to the police in the past night.
Even in Toulouse’s cars and public buildings.
Greater integration efforts of the Federal Government requested the president of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawalle in France, Kolat warned about "promotional effects".
However, the situation in Germany is not as brisant as in France.
However, it is necessary for action.
Kolat pointed out that the rate of unemployment in youths with migration background under 25 years is "in averagely high".
In particular, it must be provided for more training facilities.
Kolat said, "We need to give youths a perspective."
The President of the Turkey community, however, finds more in Germany than in France "a social control in the families".
In addition, young people with migration background did not want to do what their parents had built here.
Kolat urged, "But we must be careful."
You have to give you the opportunity to participate in work and training.
In the past, it remained hard at the night in the Parisian forort Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were used, and a shooter overflowed the area with a screen wall.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning MIE and cars.
Since the morning, a offer of about 1000 security forces provides for rest.
The police will pass as long as it is necessary, Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after an appeal in the city.
On Thursday night, in Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were hurt.
In this regard, the disasters overcome toulouse.
The Krawals were inflammated on a disaster in which two youths had come to life on Sunday.
According to the first recognition of the State advocate, the police shall not be guilty of the death of young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The reality remote occurrence of the officer evidences that the coalition is in the end - and that it is no longer expected by herself.
In what country is this Federal Conceitor?
After its unfortunate adventure in the general debate of the Bundesday, which was hard and content armed, you must say, not here - not in the country that should finally be governed by her.
The prejudice that it is too much to the external policy, Angela Merkel has rejected a very great statement.
It is provincial, she said and showed that she would not understand what the critics were doing.
In the Friday, it has documented to all recognize how much their proposal was added.
There was no concrete interest or a feeling of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Nuclear was represented: a depreciated woman flying into the foreign policy and even there in the past.
Example of climate protection: Because they are lo’s most imprisonment for the decisions of the holy name, but it does not say how climate goals are to be achieved.
Instead, the self-lob - so much insensitiveness would have dismissed the CDU head for two years ago.
Now she claims to the floods that the rebellion comes to humans.
To this end, she protects her image as a practice, the problems l', rather than the world's beauty.
But in the kingdom of Angela Nucleo, innerpolitical problems are a random appearance.
Children's harm and the concerns of the lowly servants?
There's a few neighborhoods left for it.
It is fair to how often it promises when it's about the child's advice.
Three adjustments brought the marks there to make a half-way right set out.
She's crazy as on a foreign territory, if it becomes concrete.
Attacke Department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican Presidency Candidates, both preferred Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have a hard exchange - and now have to be afraid of a foreign candidate.
The efforts of the candidates are already on the first subject.
He has made New York to a "looking place for illegal immigrants", and Mitt Romney presents his contrast Rudy Giuliani.
This counterpart of his side with hard prejudices: "I would say that his own house was a village for Illegale," Giuliani faced and suggested the former massachusetts governor to have occupied private immigrants without papers.
The candidates claim to attack: Because the Republican Base has not yet clear favourites, the eight presidential representatives use the debate on CNN in particular to discreet their opposers.
The self-dressed 30-second videos who have sent the Internet users via YouTube are almost more than the steak provider.
"In this kind of Isola, we have allowed Hitler to come to the power," says John McCain, Contracting Ron Paul, who requests an immediate decline from Iraq.
Romney also gets the Levites strongly led by the Vietnamese Veterrans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method that is simulated by drinking as folter.
However, the important issues of the campaign between the parts of Iraq war and debates show the reactions of the Hall Republic in St. Petersburg in Florida.
When conservative values are always priced and rejected future tax expenditures, the Auditorium is the case.
This shows more, where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I've been wronged at that time," said Romney increasingly and put it before the Basis and Television Republic for the fact that he still belonged to the depreciation for 1994.
Giuliani goes into the slinger when he is asked for a legal explanation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules first in civil
One day after Return as Armageddon, the Pakistanian Machthaber Musharraf has been prohibited as President.
This is the end of eight years of military government in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf has been prohibited on Thursday for another five years of office.
The Pakistanian TV overcome the ceremonie in the Chairman of Islamabad's main city.
Musharraf swears to respect the Constitution and to act for the pleasure of the nation.
In the middle of the week, he had delivered his office as an armychef to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus was a international pressure in particular from the United States.
Eight years after his masturbation in an unclean military pool, the former general is now first governing as a civil government head.
With a retreat as the overbeveller of the fighting forces Musharraf had fulfilled a nuclear force of opposition and western.
Another central request is the end of the exception state which the Musharraf had declined on 3 November.
Soon after his destruction, Musharraf will be rejected by General State Advocate Malik Muhammad Qayum and thus comply with a further request from West.
The Chief Court of the Court of the country, after the exemption of the exemption, on the beginning of November, judges with him, had rejected all disputes against the constraint re-elected of the Governing Boss on 6 October.
In this case, five soldiers were killed in the north tribe region of North-Wazstan in an attack on a military convoi and four more damage.
According to a military speaker, the bomb exploded on a street near the border to Afghanistan.
Return the fathers of the Krautrock
The German Supergroup of the Sebziger musics again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For Revival, a middle of its big time "Live 1974".
At that time, they were most famous in the foreign.
The embraced sensation then occurs in the form of three ladies set at the evening table.
Everyone has his boxes before himself, his cab, and especially his knights.
Theter Moebius thront in the blue white heat with 63 years in the middle.
Left floating by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of laptop and gitarre.
Right, considered by the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, cancered at the console.
Everyone plays sounds, including even a boat.
And sometimes it's deceived to a natural part of music.
It seems to not be great to the gentlemen themselves.
That the Harmonia band again musicates, he has provided a few insights under craftrock lovers.
In which you can entheue here: targeted applications showed that the name had been swearing by the collective pop memory, but no way so sustainable to lose this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should not the German also celebrate his living legends from the seventh cigarettes?
At the same time, what is wrongly called craftrock, in England and America has always been more than in their own country.
When the music economy provided the overliders of the Kolner Group Can 2003 echo price for lifework, they were seen in questioning German pop viewers in the Hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked at the Laudatio bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the surprise knew no limits.
In concerts, Michael Rother later shot at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the boat like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the defeat in the foreign is one.
Thus, the memory has already been given to Harmonia because the Trio was only two years and at this time also had a much less efficiency power than they were assigned to others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already musiced with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promised name Cluster.
Once we were playing under the Berlin School.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for one of the church's platform labels.
Rother had shortly helped on power work and then as a gitarist at New!, who then might be the most radical German group, played a call.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster Mouse in Exil to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the ancient Wesehof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as a cityflying community.
Less ideologically than in the commune I, where Roedelius had to be worried as a childhood.
Before in an artificial artist.
In the Sperrm, there was also a wip of the Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some have held the Harmonia.
The first album called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so the music also sounds, the band's little material noise.
The road collection was not only the self-detectation.
The now appeared CD "Live 1974" was mixed at a concert in Greesem, before some 50 buying records, as someone believes to discover.
From Rother, then, the desire to force Harmonia and sometimes exercise.
For Roedelius and Moebius, an unseatful request.
The band explained its training in 1975.
Rother landed in Esoterian Sparish and safeguarded his existence with albums as "flaming hearts".
Cluster was rebuilt in the eighth centuries and is more than it was Harmonia ever.
The Greesemer Live Album is to thank Herbert Greenmeyer.
The Greenland's platform's finger has aimed to carry the crawl as an unusual German contribution to life music.
New! has already been buried like Roedelius Solowork.
The corporate resurrect of Harmonia is located in the Berliner House of World Cultures.
Publicly subvented, under the Festival of Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and the mainbook "Kruutrock Sampler".
There is also the Love Parade finder Dr. Motte.
To convert the entire band width of the impact of the crawl rook to the following popmusic.
From Harmonia, the white position of the supergroup is exhausted.
The set of Brian Eno weeps with the most ambiguous sounds in the room: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are images that show the production with harmonia in the building level.
The legendary training serves projections of further black-white photos of hedge designed devices.
Before this, the three veterans are re-improvized.
Not anymore by closing microphones to the orchard and to the stone to lock the instruments on the outstanding effect devices on the own.
Today, the electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technical depth.
That doesn't change the chor of the house.
Under the leadership of Barbara the morning, the sun clouds are stumbled and sing in a beautiful place with the emphase "Aaaaaaaaaah!"
Crautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were searched less in blues than in musical schools (Can), technology (craftwork) or on the flight from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who calls "'68!" has not completely wrong, and the Harmonia doesn't allow it to be quiet now.
The more self-intelligent is based on the top.
Where's the music starting, and when does it stop?
This can protect a great happiness to someone who has the nerve or a flying moment.
Richard Gere is just not cyclic enough
With the "The Hunting Party" and "Morder peace" two films are again busy with the Balkan War.
But both don't convince.
Or the concepts are too much on action and packaging or they are too comfortable.
Richard Gere can't help in the Hunting Party.
The first message: Whether the war crimes of Karadzic and Mladic are hidden still in the mountains of Balkan, but calculated there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian War, now the spectacular player Richard Gere has been found.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighth Years recently because too many net-bellose roles in women's well-being films and too many press conferences on Buddhism one had the pleasure to view.
Now, Richard Gere is the most important argument that "The Hunting Party - When the jayer is to be thrown" (Why must film titles be today always longer and weird as the Lockleader tariff contracts?) maybe you have to see.
He provides a wonderful growing presentation: In fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt was taken what could have been from the right if the shick and the movie industry were not so favorable: a man who has had his best time behind himself, but himself as a ruinous thought of his neighborhood, even a significant remnant of the unique charme.
But despite this Trumpfe, "The Hunting Party" sets together with the German production of "Morder Peace", which also starts in this week, only the endless series of Balkan War films continued.
With the "Morder Peace" you can make a short process: the film works of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Cosovarian Heckens, once a prompt is still in it.
Although it is valuable that the Serbes are not present here as the only root of all evils, the television flash is lost too quickly in packaging and action.
There is a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a carway but for war.
However, the Hunting Party can just investigate the reason why it has never given a good Balkan war movie.
The story of three US war reporters that open to detect the Serb's overwhelming criminals "the fuchs" would have been able to become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another ruler and another rotationbook (two in the personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories seem to be flattering: Both times small teams go into the forest to do something that the soldiers can't, and both times it's going to be a travel in the holiday.
One of the reasons for the "The Hunting Party" boxing is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the missing cyniker with heart when he will be presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must inspire him a romantic business with a later murdered muslimian Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the floor, when the reporters in the last five minutes in the time traveling procedure, which did not create Nato, → and all the world's head-country debtors in five years: the war crimes are captured and left the Muslim Bosnians to the right.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in the Hague for crimes against the Chinese.
The film has a deepest human advantage.
He wants to recognize that Karadzic and Mladic are still running free, and he deceives the Americans and the French (they should be exclusively agreed) to follow the persecution because of secret political deficits.
But the good community and the wicked are sometimes so similar that a famous Bright-dock comes into mind.
In it it refers to the wood mask of a Asian demon on the work of the devil: "I feel compassionate to see the wooden starners, andeu: how anxious it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swimming heads, but reflecting how urgent it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War movie.
Recently, this magazine has been reported that all Iraq films Hollywood's big Flops were.
You can add: It has never given a good South Africa film.
Almost always applies: If a star is on the world's crisen herds or mine fields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "The side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blut Diamonds" with the DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are too simple at the time.
It had to go for years before Hollywood with "Schindler's list" could turn a good movie over the Holocaust.
Some films are still going to run - which now as classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been completed as a master work.
But maybe we know today where every mass murder actually comes to the same two screens, even too much about the conflicts of the world.
And this enlarges the senselessness of the rotators to tell stories.
"He's or nothing" or "the big dictator" has become so well because Lubic and Chaplin still did not know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make films.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastic distant artist view of the Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When the historic Roman "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War was asked, he answered, "This is only that some things never change.
Great cities will always be terrible, people will always be killed in a cruel way and will always rule war in Yugoslavia."
The criticism of Olympia's absorption by Beest
The depreciation of the citizen master from Hamburg's request for Olympical Sommer Games has been taken into strong criticism in the area and economic.
They want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But by beast, realism begins to evaluate the opportunities.
The chief business leader of the Hamburg Chamber, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, in the middle of the middle-week had a disappointment as "not good for the economic position".
No other project has recently developed so many motivation forces in the city as the olympiate.
"Unless this goal, sport policy would not be able to be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz requested the Senate not to finish the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "the results of a changed timestral".
The citizen Ole of Beust remained at the middle-week in previous statements, whereas Hamburg's Olympia ambitions were unrealistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides about an olympical approval, but the German Olympical Sportbund," said Beust WE日 ONLINE.
He referenced the expected decision of the Sportbunds for the beginning of December on an application of München for the winter games 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will not have real opportunities in the period that we have before 2028."
Yet, if the dream is not always clean, he said of Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) has endured the statements of Beusts.
This will result in the impression that Hamburg doesn't want to ask for Olympics games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to surprise a chance by preparing the plans at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploß in the midweek.
In addition, a refusal to claim, the Senate Chair of the General German High School Sport Conference, is the contrary to the exhibition of the Senate Chair.
There, by Beust, Hamburg's request for the University 2015 "not as a substitute" for Olympics games in Hamburg.
In the past Week Hamburg, the high school sports association had been nominated as a candidate city in the past.
The SPD citizenship group forgot the Senate to have a valuable time for the building of apartment in Hamburg.
"The development of the small grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he set on the map of Olympia and explained the apartment building," said the SPD Deputy Carola Veit and Jan Quist.
Since the SPD for the small grasbrook has always requested an integrated plan for Olympia and a later use of living, the CDU has set on the "Event factor".
The request for the Olympical Sommer Games 2012 has now made a great enjoyment in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, failed to Leipzig.
This isn't Warhol's kisten
Whoever connects the terms of Sweden and woods, thinks about Ikea, but not on Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, in Sweden, made wood kits were cast dark shadows on Warhols Working Directory.
A majority of the nineteen brillo boxes listed in "Type Stockholm" are false.
After the Swedish magazine "Expressen" has cut doubts about the reality of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes in 1968, internal investigations in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now come to a renewful result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former Museum of Pontus Hultén of the Moderna Museet 1995, are copies - and the majority of about hundred other Brillo boxes from "Type Stockholm", which are on the international art.
The story is deceived, a confusing confusion of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, Warhol in New York created his first "Brillo-Boxes", covered wood boxes based on the red-blau-white design of the paper cards of the brillo powder "Brillo".
A exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhols understanding - centers of Brillo-custes from paper: These (of costs) were not from Warhol, but were directly delivered from the Brillo Carton factory.
It was not artificial works, but their examples, just exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol 1968 has granted the authorisation to make some Brillo-Holzkists in Sweden, however not issued in the Modern Museet.
The newspapers now speak about about five boxes that at that time as authorised original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo Boxes with the name "Type Stockholm" have come into the art and auktions history.
Some of them have reached more than 100 000.
The problem is now that the Legendary Museum Director Pontus Hultén later declared falsely that it was produced and issued in Sweden in 1968, which then left Warhol.
Actually, Hultens 105 kistens were produced in Malmoe for an exhibition in St. Petersburg before 1990.
At that time Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chef conservator at Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the six Museum Brillo boxes from Swedish ownership, from which two 1968 were delivered in Stockholm: their press span plates were first founded and cut off, then white oil color was opened with a pince.
However, the copy structure from 1990 provides that the colour with a maler role without a basement was directly packed on the press span plate - it is not oil but acryl color.
"They were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another closs, the Moderna Museet will classify the six coasts in its collection as copies/output materials."
In July, freely, the authentication Board announced to follow the "super accusations" which will be raised in the cases of the powder powder.
Yet, there is an unexpected weakness.
