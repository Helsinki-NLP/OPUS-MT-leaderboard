Triunfo of the popularist in Austria, together forms 29 %
The elections preceded to the Austrian Parliament have been brought to the first adverse results, an easily debilitation of both parties of the current large coalition and a express strengthening of the party of popularity.
A strong and special loss has suffered the Australian Popular Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was severe.
In contrast, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the Government of the State of Carintia, Jörg Haider, prepares its triumphal return to the national policy.
The adverse results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains as the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent of votes, so it loses 5.5 per cent of vote in comparison with the last elections of 2006.
The worse has yet been completed by the OVP that loses 25.6 per cent, almost nine per cent of votes.
These are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two large Austrian partys from the poor war, especially for the people who called these previous elections.
Still at the beginning of July, when the OVP was out of the coalition, the populars had regarding the preference to the SPO, a significant benefit.
It is clear, however, that the voters have punished them for allowing the Government to naufrage.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been heard about the dimission of the Chairman of the party and, even today, `canciller, Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this month can be achieved in the PRESIDENT of the party.
This evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more advanced point of the electoral results, such as renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the refusal of both parties of the population - the liberal (FPO) have won approximately 18 per cent and the BZO, 11 per cent of the votes - and that the social democrats at the same time expressed their fears of repeating the same in 1999 when the peoples negotiated with the peoples (once the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 was a BZO) for a coalition government that had come to generate a sanction by the European Union.
For this clearly stated evolution, Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party and that he has already taken his return to Vienna, the national policy.
The Green Party has also been able to reach the parliament, even though he has lost quickly, and has descended from the third to the fifth place between the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the limit of four per cent and therefore, not part of Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be frozen
If it is not possible to solve the problem of the Czech scientists who have been accused of collecting illegally scattered in India, it could be reached to an injury of the Czech relations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg.
So the Minister in New York showed, after the meeting today with his Indian homolog, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this wouldn't be solved then yes, then it would be safe to this weakness," he found after the organized by the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after meet, that the executive could hardly be put into legal matters.
However, he showed that in the case of Petr Svacha, who was excluded from accusation and punished with a complaint, the Government may negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in which the matter is addressed.
"Your problem could be solved," Minister said.
For Emil Kuchera, condemned at three years of prison, would be the best, it would have been ­ Mukherjee, which would call to the highest instances.
Then you can ask for the exoneration of the cause and wait for the sentence in free, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his college was expressed in the same terms during the meeting.
"Consequently call to the Supreme Court and then the indulgence would be possible," said the Czech diplomatic Chef.
The only way that the Czech party can enter into the matter is to obtain a "legal support" by the Indian Minister.
On the other hand, he said that such a type of support is already obtained by the Indian party.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it, "recommended Schwarzenberg.
On the other hand, as the CHTK said, before her colleague insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of the Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We're really thinking of a tremendous mistake to prison and condemn these scientists of Czech," he announced.
The Minister expressed the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian party the promise that he would take care of the matter.
"I have received a lot of promises," he just found.
A Czech arbitrates a fight in the sea fund
I'm close to an electronic wall map, in which it represents the round sea.
However, the continent is not interested in it but a little lost point in the ocean to.
"The island belongs to the island, and with it also the sea fund that rounds.
The region is, at the same time, as large as one continent," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosusso, who belongs to the team of thirty members who work in the United Nations Division for Ocean Rights and Seas.
His boss, director of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes complete.
Govern this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The marine background hides even a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Petroleum and other mineral primary materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to today that bring the key to the development of medicines against cancer.
The background is greater than the firm earth
Coast countries have now started to discuss the new territory under the sea.
The United Nations Treaty is used by the rights agreed in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is essentially the continental Border, which sometimes extends to some hundreds of kilometres from the coast of the country.
This has, where the Treaty is, rights in all the resources of the Continental Board.
"Singly, by the continental border it understands the part of the sea fund and its surface, which is natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the border of the sea side, and often, to the border of the two hundred miles of marine, which is pure economic area," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external limits of the Continent Border should be submitted with a significant technical documentation based on investigations and measures.
It is the result of a number of years of work preparation.
"On of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal aid committee.
The committee has made five requests from Russia, Brazil, Âa, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have gone forward," adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, the success of the success had a worldly impact since it was the first one that was essentially enlarged its marine domination.
However, it also advised New Zealand - the surface of marine background that he obtained the committee last week is of 1,6 million squared kilometers, which is, almost six times more than the size of his own state.
Both countries have invested millions of pains for their study.
The profit that will be discontinued from the use of the marine background will, as they promise, be unvaluable.
Other states are also presenting their requests shortly.
They can do it up to the ten years since they have held the "Tratado de Montego Bay".
Where the continental Border ends begins the region of the Ocean Fund declared by the Treaty as "common inheritance of mankind".
Here, no nation has a position.
The right to exploit in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The Marine Fund, however, is not any gold mine," says director Mikulka with emphasis, adding, "their separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its scheme defined by contract."
Czechs in the Property
Today, a part of the sea fund belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is divided with other countries from then East Block within the "Interoceanmetal" common organization.
This consequently advised it in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as the same as other small states, states called "the penalty investor".
He has a faculty to explode in the area of RionClipperton in the ocean, between Mexico, Hawai Islands and Kiribati.
The area to investigate by the investor is something bigger than the former Czech Slovakia.
The background there is accidentally, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A surface of a total range of 75,000 squared kilometers can be exploded.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion existences containing nikkel, cover, cobalt and manganes," adds the Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this type of concretion.
We are rehearsed to a small patate or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which is the leyenda revived to Golem.
Liberation of the rehenes the German special force command was at the place of action
In order to resolve the crisis of rehenes, the Egyptian government had requested Germany's assistance - experts came.
When the situation was severe, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not performed.
Each time more details are known about the circumstances of liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
The data of the Defence Minister and the Ministry of the Interior in the Saving Action were also directly involved in German special forces.
Therefore, at the place of liberation, the German Army specialists and GSG 9 officers were officials of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Research Office, also experts in the field of logistics of the technical beneficial institution.
As the ministers reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because disasters, given a violent release, left to their prisoners and fled.
The Government of Egypt accepted Germany's assistance to use it as a support in the place.
"Fortunably it didn't come on that moment," said a portfolio of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September, in the south of Egypt, a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptians.
After the west in the South Egypt wilderness region, the Rehenes deported them from one side to another into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the sequencers has been unknown until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
Meanwhile, healthy and salvated people came to Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released rehenes were under the protection of the German emphasis.
He didn't say any word about the details of the release.
At the beginning, in Berlin there was no information about their vacation to Germany.
The "image", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from German air forces and reach Germany on Tuesday.
The United States Representative Chamber does not accept the salvation package
The first camera of the United States Congress has lacked a great 700 billion dollar salvation package for financial markets.
Dow Jones fell very drastic.
The United States Representative Camera with 227 votes against 206 the package of the Government for Saving the Financial Markets.
Despite all calls of President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, there were no majority of the programme to limit disaster on financial markets.
With a dramatic action, defense defenders had still been able to convince critics to accept the large package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, leader of democratic negotiations, had requested the Members to vote although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet been done," he admitted.
During the vote, Dow Jones has already fallen to more than 6 per cent or 600 points.
The cause of this was the concerns of investors that the stateal salvation package could fail.
At the end of the vote, it was relaxed and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
To allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the Representative and the Senate Chamber.
Organizators register the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizations:
A study has increased the volume of sales of travel reservations for the next months in comparison with the last year - even the winter season in more than 30 per cent.
It is a study, despite the debilitated coy, the desire to travel from Germans remains as before.
As on Monday reported the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for winter season, the travel agencies registered a total of sales that was 31 per cent more in comparison with the same period last year.
The research of the GfK Market Research Institute has already been identified.
So the sales volume of travel agencies in October was nearly 11 per cent more compared to 2007, reported the DVR.
The basis of the results is GfK numbers that are the information analysed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and calculated around the market.
The data collected are the travel reservations made up to the end of August 2008.
The DRV reported because of the debilitated rate of the dollar over all travels to the United States.
In this case, the number of reservations increased almost a third.
The preferred destination points of Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
In particular, all organized travels are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the President of the DRV.
With regard to the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel costs are "better calculable for the client than during a individual travel".
Among other things, consumers can accommodate money with anticipated reservations or with All-Inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
In the months of summer, travel was also well reserved, so the volume of sales in comparison with the past year was resumed - although another study was the number of Germans who traveled, compared to the last year.
My first feast of October
The hits of the festivals under the open heavens in the Balnear unfinished, the beer in a litre jars and the famous people clothed in traditional bars of designers.
A debut in a campaign table.
Actually, Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's rubies, the moderate in television and brings a traditional bavarian tragedy to measure.
I have the dark hair, I'm a student, and my clothes are already used.
But there's one thing that we are one: we're just in campaign tent, the grafs have already passed to us and have filled their memory cards with photos - it's very lisonier, especially because I'm the first time in Octoberfest.
That's what you're doing friends.
The traditional barbaro barbaro travels seem to be fulfilled by his function.
In fact, as a tourist in Octoberfest from North Germany, my feeling of prosperity with a traditional bavarian traces until this day was still limited.
But after reaching the Prado of Teresa, it's not all for that.
Almost everyone carries the traditional bavary treasures or cut butters; no one seems to be a case or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my dealant receives rare looks at a station of places in the chocolate.
A munician calls my attention on my dealer who had dressed wrongly: "The left side is sole, half is the virgin, in the part of Property is committed, behind it is widow."
Oh, God, now I'm throwing back to the left.
"All right," he says, "increasingly.
Others don't worry much of the sutil methods to flirt and carry fats where it is written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their naked hair.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is called Bob, is from England and is for the first time in October.
He looks like "gorgeous", which speaks with a "or" very long.
I realize it after I put his vase near the side of a litre of beer I've just been drinking.
He put it right on the side of the incendium mouth, most think that it's a cube of cover.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know to drink a lot.
Others do not have much happiness and can't consume so much alcohol.
About eight nights, health groups run through the festival and have to be concerned about poor drinks.
The sanities appear each time in group - suddenly, they are always four people who bring the sands of one campaign tent to the other.
This works as with most visitors: They come sorrows, return drinks.
It isn't seen who suffers the degrees of alcoholism and is in the gates.
"They are those who can't be able anymore," answered a healthy answer answering my question and disappeared in tumult.
Incidence victim identified by the police
The 63-year-old peatone has been identified in the hospital after it was struck by a vehicle in the Essex coast.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident in Shenfield Road on Thursday afternoon.
The woman was brought to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under the failure of leading.
Since then, it has been released under confidence.
Turkey expands its diplomatic hours
Lately before Turkey was endeavored to be a member of the European Union, the European powers had the desire to penetrate within this country.
In the east part of Bosnia, perhaps only 20 steps to Asia, one of the most interesting remains of the disastrous imperial ambition is located.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-rena style.
At least this is what the leaders say.
The building is located on the end of the platforms and leads to two tours, one for each eases, looking like a typical German assembly.
The stone's swimming.
The building in its full is a little halt.
But once overcoming the bullet, there is no doubt what was the size of the company that this was the most west door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the empire game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East to ≥ this railway that was covered up to Bagdad, and further in what it is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
His flights were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular arabes.
Because of the related isolation of the remote regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Fry War, it fell down
the British dominion and when the forces progressed in Egypt, the Turkish and their German alliance outside the Palestinian and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train of munitions exploded by destroying its designed tissue.
The Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station went down and remained at the margin of history.
But today, this railway, the entrance gate to Anatolia and all east centres, serves at least simbioticly - to highlight Turkey's will to expand its diplomatic hours.
The Party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has planned a new external policy for the country.
The related isolation of the situational regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Fry War, has disappeared.
There is now a new cooperation policy.
The Turkish Government maintains good relationships with Israel and Syria with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new external policy, I went up to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in the external policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten hours and half later - after a trip of saudides, which produced the passions of the ancient world in the documentary documentary The Night Mail, I came to the Turkish capital - new city, thought to govern a new secular state, far from the atomic past.
However, the AKP, with its clear islamist roots, represents a paradigmous change in the Turkish consciousness
who has raised some suspects in O日e and, in particular, in Washington.
A taxi leads me to the AKP seat, a ultra-modern stone and steel - builded ad hoc - in a development suburb, surrounded by medium commercial centres constructed and "potential pastures" where average business managers - men and women -- are gathered at the first hour of the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center policy of almost any party in Europe.
I'm bringing, honey, I'm sure he's still having a Blackberry.
"The objective of the external policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey in its immediate neighborhood.
The Fry War was an anomalie," he says.
Turkey has been cut into relations with her inside.
Today you have to look at East and West at the same time.
It's not a case if it's not towards one or another.
He's got to do both things.
"But certainly at some moment," I asked you, "Turkey could be committed to choose? "
"Turkey," he answers, "he doesn't want to distract that choice."
Then it subscribes a point that almost all of those with whom I spoke to that moment had almost recalled me: the relations Turkey has not only with the Middle East but with the region of Caucaso, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as to the same Turkey.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world towards East Asia and the Middle East.
Again to the Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thought returned to the two German ladies, Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu, who had assisted to build this building 100 years ago.
How many would have been surprised to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would be today in the hands of Turkey?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will bring me back to Bosnia, I agree that in those days Turkey was considered "the man of Europe."
So there are no doubts where the continent will be to restore this fascinating country.
Remembers: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (squela, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford and the Coro Philarmonic Orquesta.
As part of the musical project for the city, the next year, its magnified coro of young people, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the less than 21 years, but at the time the Proteus sang his end in 1979, several of us were ending the 20 - we just refused to give up to the core.
The name of "Proteus" (the mythological changer of forms) represented the will of the coro and the ability to execute any music present to him, whether madrial or Messiaen, whether not associated or with a complete orchest.
The musical veratility produced by this core of young people was often surprising, always emotional, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that continued to be absolutely constant during the years.
Often, Tod told us to "leave music to speak for himself."
He would say, "He knows what he wants.
It's all in music.
That's what you just have to sing!"
Its age was always absolutely clear and precise, even though never impositive, nor too flowered.
Which was the musical scarcer, I always ended at an even greater level.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If any driver should have been gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two deities in which the Philarmonic of Guildford was guided from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have revised more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been deceived by anybody – in contrast, many times have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of size and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the leaders who, in his words, simply "sealed one or two horses of war very well known throughout the world."
We'll miss much less.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his age of William Woodruff (25 September) that "in 1946 the economic history studies were renewed in Oxford and in 1950 he wined a Houblon-Norman research beach... at the same time he was studying for a license title, a mastery and one doctor."
This is in a note of Woodruff author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not completely correct.
From 1946 to 1953, he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, which was seen during which he completed a doctoral tesis on the British Cache industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Ruber Industry.
It spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a beach of Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitively left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason because Woodruff chose to pass this part of his career, it's not known.
J. Vicente Resino in Filology Facultate
"Recommended the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because its white and black graphics, documental style, are fantastic.
They called me attention to their simplicity and strength that they transmit, always treating protagonists with much respect.
A exposure that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows to catch magical moments."
Second assault for Honda's survey
In November, Honduras will start the marketing of the second generation of Jazz.
If your predecessor had already counted with a large room, this new monovolume presents an even larger internal space.
All of this are added to refined mechanics, which increase the comfort of conduct and allow more fuel.
Evolution in front of the revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz is a very similar line to the model that occurs, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
In addition, it must be indicated a innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanical dimensions.
However, before analysing the new model, it must be recommended that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than the employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, this model is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also during 2008.
Exactly in Japan they have sold about a million Jazz units since they have been sold.
The second market was the Continent Year, with about a half million units in six years.
Honduras, however, suggests that this new Jazz allows to increase the sales within the segment.
Thus, while the Japanese trade signature in 2007 is a total of 83.000 Jazz units, the estimates point to 100,000 cars in 2009, which would result in a growth of 17% in the European market.
In respect of the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8.000 Jazz units since 2002, which consists of 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation, the responsibility of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2.000 Jazz units in a full year.
Exactly the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to palirate largely the decline of sales in Spain.
In fact, the marking responsibility expects to end the year with a total of 22.000 marketed units, which is 4.000 less than in 2007, a lower of 16%.
Despite this increase in the sales of Honda, its market quota in Spain increased, reaching 1,8%, compared to 1,6% of the last year.
In addition, Japanese signature expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this Honduras quota trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five port hybrid and compact size - 4,37 meters long - of which nipone company expects to market about 200,000 units per year throughout the world.
For markets and the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of Insight will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Continent Viejo and Japan.
The Insight's commercialisation is planned for the first months of the year, once its presentation in society is completed in the January month in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its coats.
Its length grows up to 3.90 metres (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 metres (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes to 2.50 metres, which provides an increase of five centimeters.
The height, instead, was not different and remained at 1.52 meters.
In addition to increased dimensions, the internal habitation also increases.
This benefit should, on the one hand, be included a new platform and, on the other hand, to introduce the fuel deposit in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Moreover, the ability of the malter - which accounts of a double background system - is up to 399 litres, 19 litres more of the maleter of the first generation.
It is necessary to note that these measures are from the version of the engine 1.4, since the ability of Hunda Jazz malter is 379 litres.
Other improvements - besides external elements such as backlights or the possibility of mounting the panoramic cristal - is a improvement in access to back places.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row present an opening angle of 80 degrees before the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will count with two gasoline propulsors of 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both mechanics include the i-VTEC technology that gets a smaller consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refination and at the same time gets a high couple in the engine regime.
The first mechanical of 1,2 litres gets a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm to 4,900 volts.
This propulsor - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a cost of 5,3 litres and a 125 gram CO2.
With respect to the previous propulsor, which was 83 horses in the previous generation, now has 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses gets a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'Blue Card' that avoids collisions
To progress in the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents of Nissan, this time, in nature, in particular, in the springs.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking the flight of the birds as a basis, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which provides the first step in collection prevention technologies.
The Engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific and Technology Advanced of the Prestigious University of Tokio in Japan.
See Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Marka Guestion, the BR23C is presented as an enlargement of the 4 Nissan Security Scude.
This robot is intended to strengthen the ability to prevent the cholision of the brand vehicles.
Each appeal creates its own personal space in ovaled form that looks very like Nissan Security Escudo.
But the most important is the eyes of the beach, you see with a angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to flight without interruption within your own personal space.
To restore this visual function, the engineers designed what they called a Laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are located up to two meters of distance within a 180 degrees radio before the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that is immediately translated in the prevention of the collection.
"In the moment when you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the moves of a beach and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels into a right or great angle to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maniob is totally instinct.
If not, the robot wouldn't be able to repair quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratorium and main engineer of this project.
On the contrary to a beach, the robot cannot be moved up or down or in diagonal; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows you to rotate its wheels, not in infinite directions and ways such as birds.
For this reason, Nissan has used a role of rotation, as well as acceleration and disaceleration, to avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and to act if these data are.
You can not save information or intuitive logic of previous manuals, so it can continue with only a few dozens of KB memory.
This may surprise, but we don't talk about memory gigas, nor if it's meals."
This is the first step to develop new instantaneous prevention technologies of collisions, a technology that Nissan vaticin will be introduced into series cars within ten years.
The robot uses litio polymeter battery, which are lighter and longer than the variety of litio iones.
Another future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Heavy before hypotheking
It is necessary to recognize that the US Teasure Department, as well as having much liquid to make injections, is not insufficient.
Before the crisis, and to avoid shiping e ́s in hypoteques in questionable solutions, they have created an amazing and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Or, the 'Hotel of bad credits'... or the lios.
The tetrical aspect of this apartment and especially its recipient is to think one, two and even three times if it is the time to ask for a credit.
And, in particular, where to do it, what probably is your goal.
Certainly you have useful information, but little detailed.
It's more than one page for adolescents than one site for all publics.
What if the game is completed?
There may be an ensuite room within the hotel.
Something is something, because by buying a better house, we don't talk...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese, which will pay nine billion dollars to buy 21 % of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong low layer of its cotisation.

They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight aggregate Egyptians, ten days ago in the wilderness, came in the Egyptian capital after they were released on Monday afternoon.
On the morning, the Egyptian special forces were released in Chad.
All of them had a good aspect of their arrival at the 15st-30s on a special plane on the military basis of Al Maza, added to the international port of El Cairo.

Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes manchettes and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better like that.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always advanced.
Who will be raised to denunciate the poor amounts granted to the small museums, files, archaeological excavations or national historical places that die hungry?
What political will it be to remember the Federal Government that disregards his monuments and her patrimonial buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that actually preserve our inheritance as in Canada and in Quebec?
Did you know that the French government deserves three million and a half euros to restore it only the Chinon castle in the valley of Loira?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the e's and that this patriarch must be protected by all citizens, all elections and all government departments, and all this, in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the History Society of Quebec, at least 40 000 Benevolous people reacted in 211 historical, patrimonial, files and genealogies are concerned to search in the history, to preserve a few moneys of private files and to preserve archeological vessels.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, which protest with energy and desperation when promotors and responsibles lay their bulldozers against our old stones and our cementaries.
For what, a monument for history and inheritance?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The States of Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization to the Belgian-Netherlands Fortis which is in charge because of the effect of the Northern American market's hypotechnical crisis: the three countries will totally support EUR 11,2 billion for this financial and insurance institution which also has businesses in Hungary.
This weekend, the Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at higher level with the President of the European Central Bank and the responsibility for the economic competition of the European Commission.
The Fortis Bank is the first who suffered the crisis of the euro area within the framework of the international financial crisis which is being produced in several oils ago more than one year ago, so decisions adopted in respect of the Bank may be considered in a certain way.
If the decision adopted on Sunday morning, the three States will buy approximately the half (49 per cent) of the property of the Bank in its territory.
The Bank will sell a part of its business, in particular all activities - mainly insurance- purchased in the past year of ABN Amró Netherlands.
Fortis' actions started a strong decline last week, and for the second half of the week, significant signs of crisis were seen in the institution.
However, the analysts coincide with indicating that with their 85 thousand employees this Bank is too large as to allow it to be calm.
The company's actions only on Friday decreased a 12 per cent, which was the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the actions has decreased with more than two thirds.
In view of the current prices of the actions, the total value of the group's capital on the market is about 14 billion euros, but the company's executives are not real.
The Bank's direction imposed the loss of the Fortis action to the insecurity of the North American market in relation to the approval of the American package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, action has already shown a light increase.
On Friday, Philip Dierckx was appointed as a new general director.
The Bank also searched for special investors, but not yet anybody has given a specific offer.
The Belgian Government had already assured that investors had no concern, no money.
Among the clients of the Bank until now there was no panic, they did not invade the offices to recover their money.
The Fortis has his own office in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Lower in the gallery
In the United States, living and health insurance companies when seeing the medicine purchasing data, they often refuse to sign a security contract.
Specialists of privacy policy fear that the personal data market is uncontrolled.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which, in all cases, contribute to the approval of the person given.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "We trust the bullet to the bullet" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical reception monitoring programme.
Insurance companies depend on the price of the insurance and the amount of refund of the customer health status and if they believe that the risk is eligible, they simply do not make the contract.
Ants sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the control.
Dick invented a very beautifuler procedure for ten years ago: with the customer identification number, the list of medicines purchased in the last and half year, and the program itself concluded about the diseases and health status of the client.
For example, if you take systematicly large doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the grass level in the blood is practically high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
They circulate many versions of the programme, some also set a number of risks, so the security company, as well as the administration, has only something to do, even though there are small difficulties in this regard.
Some medicines are multiused, for example, some substances serve both to treat head pain and heat and even as antidepressive.
This last is an important risk increase factor for security companies while the first are not.
Special companions were made to consult and process these data, which before purchasing the necessary information from pharmaceuticals requested the patient's approval.
The authorities have already committed this, although they have not received a burden for the derogation of until now.
Some companies recently develop the results of the tests and join them with medicine consumption data have received more precise information on the health status of the patient.
Each more company has access to these data and simultaneously is more difficult to control their use.
There is a law for the protection of personal health data, but it is only applicable to insurance companies and services that provide health services.
The draft law is already before the Congress that provides right to the Authority for the control of specialized enterprises for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard recognises that this is insufficient: so he has developed his program, which will make the specific approval of the person for the supply of its own personal data.
It is another question that that person cannot refuse its approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the gallines, despite all, are exposed to the good will of the wheat.
Marsella Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually commercial partners, this issue also dominated the agenda of the nineteenth summary.
Today, it will also be held a franco-Indian summary, to treat mainly the cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognises that India is a great democracy in development that should have more vote and vote in international matters, Member States have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
This issue has not been discussed at the nineth summary started yesterday in Marsella.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU touring president, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana, received Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India, with which they reached an agreement to duplicate in five years, meaning to increase over hundred million euros, their trade exchange.
Since the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, it is not a ambitional objective between 2000 and 2007.
Thus, the victorious bilateral conventions of civil aviation with India have legally harmonised, thus air transport can fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate negotiations.
The goal is the balance, since while the EU is the first trade partner in India, New Delhi is only in the nineth place between the Union's trade partners.
The summary took attention to global matters.
Both parties condemned the Afghanistan and Pakistanian situation and terrorism - all the forms of this last - and approved the convocation of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalisation round was also approved, although both parties have great responsibility in their failure.
The EU confirmed that its energy and climate programme will be affected, namely, until 2020, he wants to decrease contaminant conditions with at least twenty percent.
India is also in accordance with this, as in the climate conference of the next year, it should be reached to a global agreement and reduced until 2050 with a 50% of the gas production that produces inverior effect.
They also want to emphasize the increase in food prices and support the convocation of a international conference for revising the financial crisis.
Today, the Governing Boss of India will travel to the French capital, where, at a bilateral meeting, a agreement on the use of peace of nuclear energy will sign.
Paris believes that the French companies will receive responsibility for a value of 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactions.
The agreement would be for a 15-year period.

Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with a original and well-designed design with defined lines and angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the lastborn among the "compacts" carriers of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has searched for a newness window in this sector.
Proposed of the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and non-conventional, the communication associated with suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exposure rooms since the next 17 October.
The public campaign was to accompany the debut of the new car to launch an unrequired mode of communication to Â of a 3D public campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car mark.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominated the center of the milenian shopping, advened as, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication starts with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special bottles distributed in the future How can you see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in tridimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images will be the impression that the car comes out of the poster.

Without doubt, Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of car communication.
Can you get the interest of the future buyers with this formula? let's see.
It's clear who the Italian Hooligans are
In the Triveneto, accession to sports demonstrations is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and girls of which Italy now has been given? They are part of the group "Old Italian" which has been followed since years ago, and who has never created too many problems, too, to say, the truth.
And they never had found themselves with the fanatics of the rival.
The extraction of the group is of de.
The promotors come from the Triveneto.
De Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These from Sofia have been added to a small group (people units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three color flags where the city of origin of the soldiers appears: Sabbath on the night have been taken out to be not identified.
They are inspired to the English fanatics.
In Bulgaria have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, of the Levski.
Figc had made available to Italian fanatics 144 entries for the party: all with names, so easily controlled.
And the minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among those who had gone to Sofia there was no one with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sports) at that moment, no one who had frequently frequented him.
Four Italian fanatics, who had criminal offences in stadiums, have hedged the billet and also the travel.
The Ministry of the Interior now expects to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sport) for five years as at least to the fanatics arrested or to whom it has been identified in the disasters.
A Daspo (prohibition of access to sports) internationally, which prevents not only the Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't stand in a stadium.
For lucky!
But now is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
"We must remove this incendie and not legitimately behave in this way," they support the Ministry of the Internal Ministry.
Therefore, "good open eyes" especially in view of the party of the National of the Midnight in Lecce."
In Apulia, there is also a small nuclear of Ultras Italian supporters.
Tomorrow the Watchtower is gathered on Thursday the Cams, which can also account with a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, namely the secret service, which is occupied with the problems in stages.
"Will Duce-Duce Cores and the army raised during Mameli's hire? In Bulgaria it's not a crime ...."
This is the thought (expressed in a small way) of Domenico Mazzi, a few weeks ago, the Director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Internal Ministry (he took the post that was before from Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzi© had been the leader of the public security, where there was a Ultras Italian group supporter nuclear, based in 2002.
It's true, as Mazziová says, that in Bulgaria it is not wrong to celebrate the Duce but if, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been confusing.
"I don't do the socialist," adds the Observatory No. 1 – the reactions will be assigned in the countries where the fact occurs.
Even now this group has been well-behaved now we will see what happened and we will take into account it for the future.
But let's also talk about the silvests to Mameli's hire: they are also not a crime, but if they allow them to be of education...."
