The Prager Börse struggle against business closure in minus.
After the stealing waste morning, the Prager Börse could correct the loss.
The transactions with the shares of CHEZ reached almost the half of the normal daily business.
The Prager Börse, at the beginning of the Tuesday business, joined the income from Monday, when it was spent about six more prospective points.
This time was the reason for the inbreak at Wall Street.
Also in Czechland, the market response is shown to the result of the voting of the representative house that it had refused to submit a stability plan for the current financial sector.
Case of action in Asia
A dramatic case experienced the actions in the season in Asia, although the index could compare some of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Börse in Hong Kong lost almost four points in the business stage, but later was able to make a part of the loss, so the decline was decreased to approximately 2,5 Pro.
The Index Hang Seng China Enterprises, watching the movement of Chinese actions at the border in Hong Kong, was decreased by 3.8 Pro¤, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares in Sydney's bars lost more than five Pro, but then the loss was decreased to 4,3 Pro.
The villages in Taiwan, according to the damn index, fell about 3,6 Pro.
"The Timeing for the salvation action in the United States is uncertain and the financial markets will be influenced worldwide," so the chief of the wallet member in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines whether it belongs to China, its election policy itself, so independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The rates in Hong Kong are moved at the same level as those in the United States.
The Legalists should, according to the words of the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, return as soon as possible to the negotiations and adopt the project for support of the financial system.
On the other hand, other countries would have been affected by the income.
A Bloodbad Ananic Actions
The Representative House rejected the plan for support of the financial system on Monday, which should be used up to 700 billion (fast 12 billion Kč).
The legislators thus ignored the request of President George Bush to submit the plan.
Bush's view would rule the basic causes for the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the whole economy.
The acts of the Ananias experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the most important actions indizes had the largest breakdown in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index sank about almost seven Pro, a similar break in 1987.
The index was already sought before the vote, but there was note that the draft in the lawyer house would not occur, the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes accommodation: US government can pump 700 billion in the banks
The main representatives of the Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed in a larger form of an agreement on financial assistance for the financial system.
This will be voted on the beginning of the next week.
The legislators reached an interruption of a salvation plan in the form of a financial aid for the financial system in a range of 700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, this does not mean any victory yet.
The Congress Advocates must, therefore, make some details of the Agreement before they are able to publish and vote on the end of the law.
The financial system's support plan will be negotiated on Monday in the Ananian Congress.
On Sunday, this said to the President of the Committee on Bank and Financial Services Barney Frank of the Agency Rebés.
In the senate, different information may probably be voted on the plan at the middle-week.
Economy should, according to economics, be notified that the plan will be prevented, the first significant psychological holder for the benefit of the financial markets.
Thereafter, however, there is a "renewment" due to complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have achieved a significant progress.
We have claimed our various views about how a package to stabilize the market," the Democracy Nancy Pelosi said to the Agency Bloomberg.
According to your words, a final vote could be made on Sunday.
The representatives of the legislators met the Sunday night with the Financial Minister Henry Paulson to provide its final form to the Governing Fund.
This provides an unexpected hypotechnology activity from the financial companies that distorts the financial funds in serious losses and provides the stability of the whole system.
"We are at the border of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You need to continue the education plan, but I think we are at the goal," Paulson.
A signal for Asia businesses
The global financial crisis is also clearly undertaken in the action markets that are strong.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in the Congress.
This is the point that investors would like to focus on the Asian financial markets in the first time zone where a decision of the Congress could affect business on Monday.
But until it is not clear, when both rooms of the Ananian Congress are voted on the law, it is also unexpected whether the negotiations in the last minute could not be caused to a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be disrupted in the next days.
However, the Law will learn some changes.
The total amount specified for the system shall be divided into two parts.
The starting 350 billion should be prepared as soon as possible as President George Bush requested.
The Congress, however, can block the exhaustion of the rest of the money if he has the impression that the program does not perform its function, even in addition to 100 billion and later the final 350 billion.
Bush makes progress in negotiations positive
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can overcome its Veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic view of the programme is remaining based on the achievement of funds for the purchase of bad hypothectic papers, which have been valuated, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their hypotheches anymore.
"We've got everything out.
The representative house should be able to vote on Sunday over the law, then the Senate on Monday," as the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
Congratulations with the progress also shown by the President Bush.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "appreciate the both side effort to stabilize our financial markets and to slip our economy".
Restriction of golden fall screens
The Chairman of the Bank Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading undertaking, forbids that the legislators would have agreed to a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of tax payers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a time plan for the financing of the plan.
The new law will also restrict the golden flights for directors of the companies participating in the programme and set up a committee to oversee the fund.
This will lead to the Ministry of Financial Affairs.
"We have made it very hard and have achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also calculates a help for householders who have problems with refunding their hypothek.
The Government should negotiate new advice on hypothekings which it is acquiring, with the goal of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Mark: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, an idea, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And therefore, because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problem activity will be taken.
This will be determining how the financial sector and the Government divide the losses together," Marek said this week to the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan will be delayed now or begin the next week, it is not exposed to Marex View.
"The more important is that the Congress lawyers have some to undertake the plan and that they adopt it as quickly as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the fact that it comes to a divorce is the most important at this moment," pointed Marek.
Double on Messer Snippet: MP3 player against phones.
We advise you at your choice
With almost every MP3 file can be played, no MP3 player can still be phoned.
So, of course, it seems that it's better to buy a phone.
Despite all, there are enough reasons why you should put a private player.
The choice depends absolutely on the type of use and the advantages of the future owners.
Certainly, you are buying a great tough player for home to listen to the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and from qualitative view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the regal, you probably dream at least of such a person.
This is also with music on travels, so with compressed music, simplified exhaust - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to give a player eight thousand crowns, but also a Pink-Floyd-Fan will be severely strengthened for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there are enough rooms.
The selection is width-secure.
The lives of the battery are also determining.
Some of the Music Players can play much more than just music, but what the phones can do, they do not even create a mental way.
There is no modern device to use as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, the phone and the Simsen, it can play music and videos, take both, it has a better, times a bader camera and may also navigate.
And if you still include the artphones and communications, you have almost a small computer in the board.
It's a little wonder, because no fridge can grill and no television photograph.
However, the phone university also brings advantages.
More functions you use on your phone, but more often you will need to download it.
And playing music is one of the largest energy fresh.
Only few phones can play music longer than 12 hours, in fact it is much less.
In this regard, Music Player (in particular the most simple) is clearly more efficient.
Therefore, you should consider on the mobile phones that they can't play music more than a few hours.
If you get out and still phone, you will better buy another load device for the Office - that also applies to more tire devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one time upload.
Another problem is then if you want to play music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a lower part of the devices over a USB closure, and any phone without special software can not be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can play music directly on a storage disk, but only few card read devices will be completed without reduction with the winners of memory cards used in the phone.
For players you do not need any special software until you find exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players themselves provide a music library, ordered according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices constitute only the tree structure of the address book, like the Windows Explorer, some can both (ever, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to serve, phones can more
When selecting a specific device you should especially experience after the lifetime of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of the sound and, of course, the use comfort.
It's music for you, especially, and you can only listen to it every day, for example, in the roadway, then enough a popular phone that plays MP3 files.
What really can almost every phone.
You don't have to also check any music formats that a phone or a player can process.
MP3 creates all, and the most music you get will be just in this format.
The format belongs to the most widespread, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less usually, AAC (a format, Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow music to buy online.
Only on the mobile Internet, you can call the corresponding pages of a provider (or another supplier) and you can buy a song or album.
This service may be an argument for itself and for itself why a music handy should be assigned.
Unfortunately, the boat of the suppliers is bad and is limited only to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, generally, this type of music purchase (see GSM, Internet, or free Internet) will in the future govern the music industry.
The phone's most of them.
If you're pleased to listen to something, take the phone in the Jackentasche while the player forgets home.
However, you are always a headless or at least a free vocational installation.
If not, you can return to the integrated audio speaker, about which almost every cell phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest benefit of the music handy will be for many in price.
The best costs usually less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns, you already get a completely anxious Walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most of them that no normal head listeners have.
The best and technically equipped phones with a 3,5-mm opening for normal headshots cost up to five thousand crowns.
The benefit of the player is again in the easy service.
The most simple - and not unlikely the best (see selection) - player can actually serve everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity of the use with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the disc player is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of an irrelevantly employed mobile Internet and a terrible account for data transfers.
Which device should be taken now
In addition, the best mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually available to a lock for exchangeable memory media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you purchase a corresponding card, two thousand crowns.
But respect.
Basic models are usually supported only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most precious can also read 8-GB speech cards.
If you already want to buy a phone and another price MP3 player, take to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
After capacity (max. 2 GB) then you must not put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you belong to the admired listeners, please take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have own MP3 buttons and the service comfort comes to a single MP3 player.
The most important is here, Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individual MP3 player.
The same services in the same price category from up to four thousand crowns, but with a memory capacity (to 16 GB) and a long battery life (normally 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) allowed you to play MP3 players of the manufacturer above.
The first supplier already comes to Czech in this year.
Maybe
The mobile in Czech Republic is equipped, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Yet, there is something - a holding supplier that forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this will not wait for a long time.
The fact that the Czech mobile providers work at the most prestigious in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This also worked by the CTU, who noticed that the price for a SMS is here as in the European Union.
According to the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming taxes, it is likely to have a paradoxed situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile suppliers, SMS will be more eligible from the outside than home.
How does prices in Czechland be so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, it fails the competition, which really makes an anxiety of battle.
Maybe it sounds paradox, there are three mobile networks in Czechland and a penetration of more than 100%.
The mobile suppliers, however, want to switch about that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Council (CTU) Pavel Dvořák, who often stated in the past that there was no place for another provider in Czechland.
It is probably true that a classic provider with a own network has no longer many chances (only he would like to find some of the frequency).
But there's another possibility - a compulsory provider.
At the time of the entrance of the suppliers on the mobile Property, a clear price decrease had to respond to the classic mobile suppliers.
There were still similar votes in the market in the United Kingdom as in Czechland before the entry of such companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile.
But it has shown that there is a place for such providers and that they can really be.
Moreover, you have to look for examples for a long time.
In February, we reported about the start of the supplier's mobility in Poland.
In only a half year, this provider won over 100 thousand customers and thus increased to the fifth largest provider of the country.
After mobilization, the Penta group is located in Czechland, including U:phone.
The benefit of the supplier is that you can be able to take a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, suppliers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the building, operation and interview of a mobile network.
In the world, the institutional providers are normally as low-cost companies - they offer favorable telephone talks and SMSs, which is often accompanied by a less large service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in British SMS offers at least the help of its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilization in Poland, it may also be a good choice to put a non-clicking target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the supplier who loves and trusts them," as David Seibert, the CEO from the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this supplier.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept like in Poland could be taken into Czech.
This is also the press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepisk: "The Czech Market is relatively small for a market segment based on the majority of suppliers.
"He is relatively semied from the view of the service offer."
In Czechland without chance, the mobile supplier
However, it is almost sure that if a mobile supplier obtains Czech, this will not be mobile.
"Although we speak of an expansion of this project, in Czechland the negotiations are not hopefully looking forward.
In a telephone talk for mobile.cz Jana Studničková, Presse speaker of the Financial Group Penta.
Indirectly, it was not accessible to the current mobile suppliers in Czechland.
In contrast, they are trying to do everything so that no potential competitor occurs.
Your interest at the start of a mobile supplier has already longer been shown by the GTS Novera group who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telephone O2 in the field of companies.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only firm networks but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, it's better.
About this, we have recently negotiated with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them, we had already been able to achieve negotiations," as the press speaker of the group Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe there are better times now.
Not official information shows that the first supplier may be expected until the end of the year.
But too long, this is circumcised by an unwindable wall of weight.
"In this moment, we do not conclude that there is a place in Czech for a full-valuable supplier.
The Czech market shows great specifications towards other markets.
There has not yet been any subject to us with a complex and serious project in this area," mentioned in his claim for mobile.cz Vlastimil Srscheň from Telefonica O2 Presse Department.
The specification of the Czech market also shows additional suppliers.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová f ́ in rare agreement with the O2's applause: "We have not yet found a liveable and both-side advantaged project on which you could continue to build."
And she adds: "In the T-Mobile network, there will be no longer a company supplier to the end of the year.
At this moment, we have already had a specific boat to think so shortly."
Wodafone is more attentionful to the inheritance of the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepisk says: "For negotiations with potential suppliers, we are open, especially in the area of splitting costs and infrastructure.
This is just what we consider from the view of the customers as the best.
The main strategy of Vodaphones in this area is searching for a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers' hand in hand
The procedure of the mobile supplier is easy to understand, another provider calls more competition, which would lead to decreasing prices and thus reduce the winning.
So why should such competitor easier the market income?
That the suppliers can move to a straight, if something is happening, the long hin and the back will also refer to the outcome of U:phone.
The strongest pressure in the direction of CTU was at the time when U:phone came on the market, from the T-Mobile company.
This also shows public accessible information from the CTU websites.
But now, U:phone is just a argument why you should not allow an institutional provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The concurrence area of the Mobile Propertyes was recently strengthened by the marketing income of a fourth mobile supplier.
In view of the character of the Mobile Property in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor would make high requirements on the market himself and, in particular, his services."
However, in view of this approach of mobile suppliers, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory staff is surprised.
This is not only the position of the CTU, which is in Czech, in the subsequence of British and other highly developed countries, has no power to engage in the economic competition.
This is the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But this was a very typical attitude to this whole problem.
"The entry into the market of an institutional mobile supplier would then be possible after a contract conclude between a mobile provider and an institutional provider on the approval of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded until now, because the potential interesters' boat was probably not enough interesting for the classic providers," so in his response to our request Crisian Chalupa from the UOHS External Relations Department.
The representative of the suppliers would not surprise such a formulation.
A authority representing consumer operators and, among other things, to take into account that no one dismiss his position on the market is more important than it is.
In particular, when Christian Chalupa adds: "In the outerland where suppliers work very normally, it is to observe that their marketing entry has been added to a price in mobile phone services."
However, the pressure is probably part of the correct functioning of the market and a price not to the interests of the UOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking that the nearly increasing complaint of the three mobile providers that result from their reactions.
The question is whether it is really just a case, is on the hand.
Similarly, the absolute gas price in tanks is only a case and the result of a hard competition fight.
"In this matter, the Authority has not discovered any signs that have hindered against competition, and therefore it has no reason to take into account any way.
No of the suppliers has a dominant market position, thus he has no higher responsibility for his actions on the market.
The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile holding of the suppliers for the telecommunication regulatory officer have probably also fallen," Chalupa in his clothes.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many striking points.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets, out of the CTU, after telecommunication from the economy's view of competition, a single market.
On such market, of course, no of the Czech mobile suppliers has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer another view - for the marketing of an institutional provider, it is always necessary to agree with the network operator.
And the mobile provider has, logically, the monopol for his network.
This means that he accepts a dominant position in a specific segment.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UOHS that three mobile suppliers are similar.
In this context, a number of interested persons (such as the GTS Novera company) showed that they were very similar in negotiations with all providers.
The responsibility to the CTU is then a very usual trick in the telecommunication services with which the UOHS is distant from the whole matter.
This was already to be watched in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement the recent Novelle of the Telecommunication Act the extension of the powers of the CTU on the field of the economic competition in telecommunication, although a number of experts had been able to improve the situation.
This must only be well known by the representatives of the UHS, but they probably have different interests.
It's going if no one looks at it.
Unrespectively, the functioning of some pseudovirtual providers remains at least one time, of whom there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
There are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunication services, but only shares are public.
Normally, it is businesses that act in the field of multilevel marketing.
For example, mobile phone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only selected.
The point of the matter is that the company is a classic company with the operator, which represents a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile suppliers will provide a similar continuation.
"If there are cases you describe, then it can be a deterioration of the contractual conditions with which we will then take care of what can lead to the end of cooperation with the company concerned," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
However, it is pretty unlikely that such a thing is not relevant to the responsibility of the mobile suppliers.
In the case of three employed companies, it may be a thousand clients.
However, no operator is opposed to such a procedure.
From the activities of these companies, they were not too reduced, at the same time they will, in the subsequence of the real facilities providers, be not affected by the official marketing.
On possible problems, Miroslav Čepisk notices: "The law allows such species of specule, despite all, the services of these companies will only be sufficient from a very low progression of customers.
These must also accept that the SIM card is not running on their name, so they cannot have completely what the normal customers of the mobile providers are."
But it should be alone that the CTU should be at least strange.
▪ Another question is opened for the OECD.
Close the mobile suppliers from such a procedure, why are they locked against an institutional provider?
It is added that the OECD has sufficient powers to discover such activities and, if not, it must not be satisfied with the declaration of the suppliers, they knew nothing of it and their business conditions would prohibit it.
WHEN Czech isn't in the most dust
As the text has already shown several times, the market income of the suppliers has made a clear decrease in the different services.
In practical cases in all countries where suppliers have occurred, the classic providers have attempted to prevent their exhibition practically more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too small, or too stressed market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the high-developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies are at this point, which are not anyway trying to pursue the interests of the mobile suppliers but their customers.
In the case of formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached the first operator and followed it further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies become the whole case as a warm cartoffle.
From our experiences, we cannot consider the impression that insight in the powers in these cases is more favorable.
But we don't put the floor into the corner.
If the background information is voted and soon occurs a supplier, the Czech Mobile Section may be moved back soon.
If a supplier allows the extinction of an institutional mobile supplier, the OECD will not remain inactive if it is to refuse other interesters (discriminate).
And then the Czechs will finally not telephone more tougher than Europe's.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new records of the National Hymne where my homeland is.
The Hymne was newly played by the orchester of the National Theater under the leading of Jiří Belohlávek.
There are four versions - with man or woman's song, in Chorfassung and in an instrumental version.
The summary adopted Catherine Kněžnikov and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymne versions are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Belohłavek, the Czech National Life is one of the most beautiful hymnes.
Soon before he had told the Czech Republic that he had chosen for the Solo-variant songs with young, representative voices that are marked and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried both and then with the Chor to keep a clear diction to understand the text well so that a vote might occur," says the director.
The Czech National Hymne comes to its 175. Jubileum next year.
The song Kde homev my first experienced 1834 on the top of the stone theater in the original Czech Fidlovačka part of Joseph Kaietán Tyl, which was the music of František Schroup.
It became evasive, and the people took it spontaneously.
The first power of the song was then made to a organic component of the national hymne after the release of the Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven State symbols remained also after the exhibition of the Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymne sounds
The Prager Verification Manufacturers carry out the middle of the middle-week also on a chip
The middle Week, 1 October 2008, will enter into the history of Prager Veríbies as a date in which a U-boat, a roadway or a bus enters the first travelers in the place of a paper vehicle in the chair.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people who have the Chipcard Opencard.
The guests can buy a 30-day, 90-day or a year-coup (a valid from 1 January 2009) and play this together on their chip cards, as well as in the information and sites of the transaction operators at the U-Bahn St, Museum, Mostek, Nadraje Holešo, Andel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajska zahrrada, Kacherov and Luka.
The coupons have been available on the web pages of the transaction operators www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was charged by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet reverse can actually forget the U-Bahn-St, where they have to wait regularly in long snows on their paper facilities.
You buy the coupon on the Internet, this will be played on the opencard in one of the three branches of the city library.
"In these places there is also a traveler with educational staff, the interesting persons in the Internet cooper and also playing the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrny.
Besides the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on the opencard, which are placed in some U-Bahn Vestibuls.
How do these machines look like?
They are red, advertising to travellers, the guests may have already observed in the U-Bahn-St. Roztyly, Bu日ovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it must be eighty," f ́Opatrny added.
The coupon controls the location of the driver an auto
The use of the machines that will be working from tomorrow is easy.
Only you have to enter the chip card, and the previous coupon is playing from yourself.
The electronic coupons apply not only from morning in the main city but also in the environment.
Thus, in the preconditions and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the people of the region's communities were in the main city.
"In the moves that belong to the Prager integrated foreground, the traveller reading devices with which they can check the duration of the coupons after time and zone," Philip Drápal explains the vehicle checks from the Ropid Organization. This organization is a combination of the vehicle plans for the Prager Training Operations.
The pre-town buses have card reading devices on the box at the driver.
When incoming, the chip card must be shown not only by the driver, but the opencard is to be placed at a identified place on the side of the box.
This means that the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"When a driver wants to check the validity of the played coupons, it is nothing easier than the driver to ask for this information," says Drapal.
A traveler who doesn't drive with pre-town buses and doesn't know anymore when the coupons' validity ends can go back to the self-service cars where the coupons are played on the map.
Here the information about the validity of its documents will be displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudetens asked the United States to decide a people
In 1945, the south-deutsches requested the association of the Böhmerwald to the United States.
This comes from a letter that stores in the collections of the South Bohemic Scientific Library.
If we are not able to be part of Germany or Austria, we will at least want to live under the screen rule of the United States of America.
With such a desire, in 1945, some groups of South Indians have been joined to the US presidents.
This includes a letter that remains in an archive and is stored today in the collections of the South Bohemic Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the presidents in the letter that he should not allow the return of the "Suden Gaus" - which was taken on the basis of Hitler's Munich Agreement - to the Czech Slovakia.
"We have understanded the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that the unity of the Ananias is not being a subpressor and enemy of the German territory, but as a freedom," it says in a letter that is understood by the words "men whose shicks are on the south salon".
Since the attachment to the Czech Republic of Southern Germany, known as the Czech National Charakter, believes that they would expect Brutality, Inconscience, Inconscience, Understanding and Slavery, the representatives of the letter ask for the Presidents of the Czech National Charter for today and forever to take the protection rule over the Bohmerwald.
"We can't believe that you're without prejudice to the view of a quarter million inhabitants of this territory to speak to a foreign state for us, trying the minorities under and eliminating and purely have nothing to win the Alliated," it's reading in the letter.
The reason for which the manufacturer can't sign is the most likely before the "Checkish subpressors" costs.
If the US President doubts about the remembrance of the Böhmerwald Germany, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a people's decision in Böhmerwaldgau about whether the population would be part of the United States or would live under the United States' protection government.
Although the text of the letter in today’s knowledge of the war history can sound something naive, he, however, considers some periods a picture of the expectations of the Sudetan Indian.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to say at least that they would be negotiated about their discharge from the Republic, only some of them had become such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and the United States and the United Kingdom would handle a kind of autonomy for the Sudan.
Others believed that they could just stay in Czech Slovakia.
It also works on the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as Buddhist Germans at the Marine on the East Sea.
When he came to the end of the war in British prison and was held in a prison camp in Holstein, thousands of other bohemic Germans came to him to teach them the Czech.
"You believed that if they came home, they would have passed the Czech," said Chalupa.
No one of the German war prisoners who had been held before the war in Czech Slovakia considered that it would be released on the basis of the Beness decrees from the Republic.
You don't think, then you're kidding!
A emotional loaded campaign is addressed to the car driver
The closest action to security on the streets in the Czech history.
In addition, the emotional loaded media campaign was able to be characterized, which would like to start the Middle Week Ministerial Ministry.
The Authority of Minister Aleš Rébiček promises to leave the leader of an anniversary behavior behind the road.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run in television, in the radio, in the cinema, in the Internet, but also on flights.
It must remove the driver from too faster vehicles and alcohol on tax.
And they also admonish that they will be forced before the arrival of the driving.
In particular, the campaign wants young drivers, motor radiators, footsteps and not recently to speak in consciousness.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who call emotions.
This also includes the "black" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think, then you're kidding!
The words "does not think" are in cases of characters.
And in a blood laugh, the word is "paid".
This should mean that you can pay a moment of unnecessaryness with your own life.
The spots will be "shocked up until 2010".
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where you can see all normal images with drastic records of accident victims.
It is promised that the accident numbers and the number of stations are decreased in the Czech roads.
The Spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and tissue for car vehicles
"For the drivers, the motto sugar bread and peitche is applied.
Sugar bread means that she, for example, spare time when they walk with red.
The pitch is then the destruction of a punishment or accident.
The driver needs to be reported to the risk," as the psychology of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And therefore, the psychology means that information campaigns are needed in the press and especially negative publicity.
Not less efficient are his view of tables that take care of the drivers.
"If you set up a statistical table that warns before a rubber, this will probably be soon complicated with the environment, and the drivers will not see them anymore," says Korján.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in the exchange of peace
The president of the provisional Israelian Government Ehud Olmert has spoken for the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, thus Jordan, East-Jerusalem and Golan-Highs, if you can conclude peace with Palestine and .
This he pointed out in an interview that was printed on Monday from the Jediot Achronot journal.
"We must reach a agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occuped) areas, if not all," Olmert said to the journal.
"We have to keep a certain range of prosecutions of these areas, but we will be to the Palestinians a similar rate of prosecution (Israean regions) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He concluded that a possible return would also include the East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want tractors or Bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has to have to be dismissed on a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the case of two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and killed a thousand people.
According to the words of the Premier, it will be necessary to find a "specific solution for the temples and the holy and historical places" which are located on the territory of the ancient city.
"The one who wants to retain the Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued confirming.
Return from the Golan-Highen
Olmert said about a department of Israel from the Golan-Highs, which is with his view as an inappropriate term for the conclusion of a peace contract.
This would, however, also require certain efforts on pages of cuss.
"My proposal doesn't mean to conclude with unique and only on the basis of a derogation from the Golan High Peace," confirmed Olmert.
"The guests only know everything too well, they have to disturb them to get back the Golan-highs.
They will need to disturb their current relationship with Iran; they will need to disturb their relationship with Hisbollah movement (schitical) and they will need to dismiss the continuous support they will give to the terrorism of Hamas movement (schiitical) and the terrorist network of Al-Khaida and Dschihad (the Holy War) in Iraq,” the Prime Minister specificized.
Questions after accident: Is Stewards in the bus unusual?
The law doesn't know it, in a remote bus it is not allowed to run
With regard to the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travelers can run and run during the bus travel.
"If we strike and keep the law formally, the activity of a Stewards is in contrast to the Law on Road Travel", as the speaker of the Ministerial Ministry Karel Hanzelka.
The accident during the last week a two-year-year-old Stewardess was probably caused by the LKW's driver who crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting at this moment with all disasters next to the driver on the least safe space in the car, although she had two other places.
But a bus can also have an accident or breaming in the moment where the Steward coffee or magazines are exposed.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped with the carrying letter, as well as with staff places.
If this is not intended in the bus, the travelers must sit.
The remote travel buses of Student Agency have no stage places; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, worked against currently.cz.
"This is what we have discussed with the Ministry, and this has not first accepted the movement of travelers.
Later, it has been rejected, and we are reached to a consensus, where the travelers can go to the toilet when they have their place," he shared his position.
The Law doesn't know Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a Stewards - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no law that prohibits the transporter to provide services.
The Road Travel Law only knows the term of the vehicle members, but its rights and obligations are not defined, for the speakers of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly added.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Department of Joseph Pokorny considers that the law covers this problem.
"The bus in the product sample also has a stainboard.
It's all that's then," he's noticed.
Buses are shared in town buss where there is a stage and the maximum speed is limited to navigation buses with steel stations and a allowed speed and remote bus without steel station with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with security garments.
As in the aircraft, the expert says
The BESIP expert for Safety Jaroslav Horien does not see a fundamental problem in moving Stewards on a bus board.
"The situation is comparable to the service on the board of a flight, in a flooding way, not many of them do not bear, but the situation is comparable to the service on the board of a flight.
Even here is not sure when turbulence comes, and the Stewardess can stand the head."
"But if a bus is scarce, then, of course, the laws of the physics are also applied.
Like in the town bus or in a roadway.
The safety of Stewards must be held by the carrier by internal rules," he also states that this problem is not completely resolved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to deal with the services
Student Agency provides as the only Busfirma Services of Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider its profession as riskably after the accident.
"When I get the impression that the profession of Stewards is riskable, I'll stop it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive the travelers when incoming.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin based on the failure of Stewards inside buses. But his company was only a part of lines in comparison with Student Agency.
"We don't have Stewards, but we're going to go on from the beginning.
Before or later, this ends with any death accident," he had not expressed a year ago for Tyden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Neapel, a young Stewardess from the region of Pilsen was unfortunate, which had two years of age for the society.
The Slovenian LKW was probably rejected without blink from the stage and had locked the bus.
The carrier of the bus tried to eliminate a scarfed manover, however, with the right advantage of the LKW.
That the two places for the Stewards were baptized, Jančura strikes.
"They can't be reserved in remote connections, they're blocked."
The company wants LKW Fahrers.
The Agency will not wait for the court, but also expects a financial refund from the parties of the guilty.
A change of law?
Not in view
A more precise regulation for the movement of Stewards on the board of a bus could bring a legal regulation in which a three-five expert team of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is already over one year.
"This, however, has not yet been reached to any concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not limited to the agenda, before the pointing system, the maximum speed on the car and the use of phones in the road," says Fachmann Horien.
"The Ministry of Defense does not consider Stewards' activities as something that could consider the safety of the travelers essentially," such as Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the power of the police and the workshops.
Düsseldorfer Hope of Silence in Frankfurt
In the letter of WestLB's representation to the employees of the House, it is not in great words.
A combination of units of the Düsseldorfer money institution with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank can be "the central capital house of the Sparkassen Financial Group" means the writing made on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable entry force in such a business.
And, at all, such a connection of the decision-making approach may be to further commitments in the country banks sector.
This is what it is reading if a statement wants to demonstrate actionability in a difficult time.
Because the attacked WestLB is likely under violent pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Action for Financial Services Supervision, which the North-Western Government has clearly made clear the time to find a future solution.
From a closed connection between the Deka bank, the Sparkassen pounds for their investment funds, and WestLB has been talking - also on Frankfurter side since sometimes.
For example, Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas has made clear at the proposal of the half-year numbers end August, in a fusion of the house on the countryway with a country bank, including Helaba or WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Governing Council of Deka, which has ever been able to help the country banks and Sparkassen associations, has ordered the proposal to lead to the WestLB talk on common business.
It could be about the capital business or parts of it.
The talks have been free, as it is in the financial place, just started first.
From the Deka bank, which counts with their 3000 employees to the most important employees in Frankfurt’s financial place, it is not the first time to talk about consolidation in the Sparkassen sector.
2003, it seemed a moment as long as the Deka bank could join the Rheinland Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this triangle.
As the plans were made public, the Hessian Government has said against the share of Helaba.
Even the other two householders were not found together.
The Landsbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landsbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, it has always been playing ideas about a connection of the Deka bank with country banks.
However, Zeleth’s president, Günther Merl, had spoken against planning games on a meeting with houses.
In independence, however, it seems to be aware that a summary of the different households of the public-local sector No.
After the landing choice in Bayern is over, the country bank Baden-Württemberg could first be closed to the BayernLB.
For the Helaba, this is not a message.
If the pressure increases to further combinations, you go to and to the partners.
In the southern, she would be just more younger partners, although she had even more overcome the financial crisis than the households in München and Stuttgart.
The Sparkassen and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has been assigned to the Helaba with 85 Pro, has proposed a rigel in the beginning of the year.
However, the North LB.
Such geostrategic reviews are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of each house are suitable.
In June, Merl, the decisioning question to ensure the future capacity of the country banks, has not been answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
At the end, it could also be a deal of West LB that, however, is not desirable for it.
Thus, in the letter of the present representation, there is also the talk about, in any case it will have a "compatibility" solution for the house.
As it allows individual units to be assembled with the deka-bank under a hair, it will still be shown.
The second weekend is "Italian weekend"
For Elena, it's the first thing, for Luca the fourth or fourth time.
But this time Elena is his friend, and that's all different, he says.
After them, at the five-liter beer-fass of the Marke Caiser, a massive geba ́ Bartiger is showing about 200 October festivals, which the deep teeth can produce his chest.
Elena gives Luca a shot, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parkplatz near the Bahnhof Puorta Nuova, starts at this evening at 23.45 a.m. four buses, "destination Monaco, festa della birra", expected to be 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly held to the Italians, traveling in a bus from Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking place, the South Americans have already sing near their fashion, they have already been in the night.
And so sound, "Marcoguard says, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, which carries a long mantel with pelcimitat feed and a brilliant with wide silver bottles, belongs to the buses.
Since five years they go to the October Festival, three tours are alone this year.
On the night, on the show, back at 22:30.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary food, says Marco.
75 euros cost the road, the welcome shopping with Kaiser-Bier, which was acquired of the Bayer cleanness offer, the hospital security and the German traveling course - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And the buses are already rolling the night, on the car street "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
She's going to be hard in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It will be held in Brixen and Holz Churchs, where some other buses with Italian characters on the carway 8 shortly before monkeys have a break again.
When Marcos Group is planned about half seven hours before the parking place near the Teresi, there are 50 other buses from all Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather themselves, Marco holds a last Ana, explains the attack plan.
First: Set the yellow capsule.
On the other hand, "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, the Internet address of Marcos Reiseburo: "knowscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors go up to the bird, it means run!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Leave!" Run and set the places in the back of the cell.
"Not forward, else we're blocking, and not all the gears on the same legs, distributing in the room!"
The measure, Marco, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the drink.
"The security clauses show that we're doing good!
When you leave the plagues, they are away."
Thirdly, "Tonight get half one again here!" Do you understand?
And it's going to show.
On the road, a yellow cap as a travel mark to the trees, on the skies and even on the election plate of a large Bayer people party.
You want to be armed for the backward.
It's the second weekend, as "Italian weekend".
There is no exact information about numbers; the talk is about 50,000 who are on the road over the alpes and fall into the birds, the pro­per of all sugars should be added to this week extra from Italy.
The Münchner Police is strengthened by seven police from South Tyrol, Italian voluntary assistants understood the Bayer Red Cross, which leads to a NBC statistics in which the Italians before the British (approximately 60 units) and Austrian (approximately 80) with approximately 200 insurance.
In the case of the Italians, the courtyard is stumbled.
Sleepless nights for believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stabil, emphasized Federal Financial Minister Peer Steinbrück in the last week.
How good it is that the more uses the word "relative" and also involves that the German banking sector will not be dismissed by the Christian developments.
Because it's coming on the weekend.
The Münchner in Dax noted Immobiliary Financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion credit from a German consortium of banks in order to avoid turbulences to the markets.
One person trusted in the situation said to Reʹs on Monday that the credit aid was granted up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only needs to understand the part it also takes.
The money comes from private and public-right banks.
The background is lost by the daughter of Depfa.
The State financer had a periodic report for long-term projects for which he had provided money refinanced extremely short-termly - which is not possible in the mistaken markets.
In the first half year 2008, the bank's reserve was spent by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million, and the capital rates were easily reduced from 1,6 to 1,45 %.
The current income and net income from financial business were covered by zero in the previous year period, the income from claims to requests and certain value papers and the recovery of refunds in the credit business of more than 70 % of EUR to 5 million.
Only thanks to the income from reimbursements of post-contracted costs from the restructuring of the former deeppa group and from the replacement of rates in accordance with the tax regulation and from the business insurance for concerning companies, the income mining of about 16 % had remained moderated.
The former State financer had been inspected after his implementation in 1990 with professional immobility credits, which were then divided into the Aareal Bank.
Since the classic state financing was too small, the Depfa was then enhanced in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the State (Private-Public Partnership, PPP) and international diversity.
At the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make a record which will have a "essential material effect" on the winning and loss of the group, it is rightly unapprovaled.
The fact is that the division was driven.
In 2007, it was shortened by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a significant State and infrastructure financer since the receipt of the depth.
It is stronger than other institutions depending on refinancing at the interbanks, since she has no customer institutions.
With the summary of the Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit grant among the banks is re-speed, since the banks are equipped with their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate offered annually for a part - approximately 50 billion euros - of the Depfa credit portfolio short-term refinancing funds.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the financial need for the group with the credit is covered at an unexpected time, and the company is covered by the "influence of the currently unfunctionable international monetary markets".
Other sources are to be heard that the refinancing has been guaranteed until the end of 2009.
The HRE Presidency of Georg has explained Funke, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take account of the money markets at adequate time.
Bundesbank and the Bundesbank for Financial Service Supervision (BaFin) indicate that the marketing capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now safe.
This is expected for actors and believers of the Bank.
But because of the dynamic and inadequacy of the crisis, there is no consciousness.
It is not even incompatible that the financing should not be completely approved.
But the opposite is not to be excluded.
Following the bank’s conference on Sunday, the bank was still before the in·nz, the at least temporary salvation would not be able to make the residents low.
The action rates are 75% at 3.30 euros.
However, the training courses are very well.
If the priority debts are uncommonly moved, the courses of the neighbouring facilities are clearer.
In particular, the contributions of the former daughter-in-law Württemberg Hypo are addressed and, of course, the time-limiting periods passed over 2009.
If the hypo-real-estate advantages are formed as a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered according to the clear decrease of the bank crisis and of the institution itself, which the crisis had been taken first in the house as depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the note banks, governments and less proposed business banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a periodic allowance of pensions may be expired.
But this is what no longer expects to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, because of the reports on the subconstitution, the probability of security limits has now become just a reasonable hope.
In particular, the long-term believers should prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
The short-term investors may still use a loss-rate contract for future payments for the currency benefits of the years later.
Silvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first school day at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to kick: the German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas - in the new exchange log she told her about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
I had a battle before school road.
I lived at the Tokios edge in the direction of Kawasaki and spent 40 minutes with the tour to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, for happiness I didn't pass.
The beginning of learning at Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at home in the Netherlands.
The students work from eight hours, until twenty-nine a short meeting round with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the teaching started, I was able to imagine.
I'm not the guy who wants to speak before people, nor before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform, I had a old rock of my guest mother, including blue, blue knees and black leaders.
So in this box, I have put myself before the pump and tried to say everything right: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I'm Silvana, come from Germany and have a weekly birthday.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started two years ago to learn the language.
The 31 girls in the class have all been cutting, cutting and won, and then I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survivory word shadow of the Japanese girls and means 'soft, sweet'.
Then I'm quickly married to my place.
The girl near me was very wide, she found a honour that the student should sit near her.
The hour was quite hard, but when the Gong killed, I was regularly depressed.
Everyone talked and kissed and asked me of laughers in the bathroom - that is really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then, in the pause, all their bentos packed out.
My guest mother also made me a lunchbox - that's something else than the ugly German pause bread.
I had rides with cry, small worsts, salat from gurkens and algens, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantle.
Of course, I don't have a black shimmer, exactly what I'm eating here in Japan.
The things look wonderful and smiling completely newly.
Fest says it's really beautiful.
Well, until the salt flows may be, brerrr!
The Bentos are not just at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento that she then makes specially artistically - in the hope of teaching the boy closer at the pause.
That's what I've been leaving in my Manga Comics.
I'm once stressed if I can watch this too.
'Why did Japan calculate?', my friends asked me when I told them that I want to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I've always said,
'Cause it's fascinating me now.'
I've been reading the most loved mangas for years.
And to understand better the comics and culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese.
So I was completely sure that I had to travel here sometimes.
Because I also have a weakening for tradition, seats and breasts.
And there's a big value here.
On the other hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disgusting and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't yet lost myself here, even though Tokio is the greatest city I've ever seen."
Also rats have feelings
Is a race or a sheep flying at the same time that it also feels afraid?
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same if they be like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been published by famous professionals since several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have experiences and other consciousness, without that I or anyone else could prove this until now where we could not even prove that others have a knowledge.
But in this case, at least, we should hope that all human brains show the same fundamental configuration.
However, when we apply other species and address questions of the feeling or generally of the knowledge, we come into an indirect land because the hardware does not agree.
When a race makes it the same as many other animals: it becomes dead, fleeing or takes it.
Humans behave similarly, whereas some characteristics are involved in a comparable entity experience.
However, I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to overcome our entity experience on the animals.
To one, the almost always associated with the human knowledge of the cortex side prefrontal Cortex (for its share in the short time memory and in the execution/control functions).
This wide region is developed much in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in the aspects of our conscience, which depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason for the idea that humans are even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic property must be in the language nature of the human: since a large part of his experience is connected to the language, it often refers to the knowledge depends on it.
In this case, you could exclude animals.
However, even if a consciousness does not depend on the language, this would certainly affect it, so that animal knowledge, as well as possible, may be very different from most of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out how consciousness can appear in other animals.
If it is possible to analyze, as something internally and subjective, neither measuring nor, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, his research causes us great problems.
Most of my exhibitions are related to the content of the most conscious experience, but there is another aspect of the knowledge that must be scientificly easierly accessible.
You can examine the process of consciousness of animals without prejudice to their content, and this is exactly what happens in the short memory of primates, especially in the example of visualisation.
However, in this approach, Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the neural correlates of consciousness are more likely to be the same or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the prefrontal Cortex for the event of visualisation.
What is happening for the receipts now?
I bring them back to the activation of a emotional system like that of fear in one of his own A > conscious brains.
So what we fear is the mental state in which we are, when the A > of the localized system of divergence (or their consequences, such as corporate reactions) show work memory.
This is how the receipts are closely linked to the regions of Cortex, the primates, and especially the people.
Related to the language nature, the feeling is nice, because we can distinguish and category with words and grams to write them to others near us.
For example, Antonio ́io, for example, considers that receipts from primitive A ́s in the cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, is more consistent of the brain stem.
Since this network has not been very changed during the human evolution, it can be shared in transient receipts.
I can't speak theoretically, but I think it is uncertain.
Pankseep arguments what occurs in rats and people like fear, probably feels like this in both cases: How can you check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similar?
Does a sheep fly when it also gets fearful?
In my eyes, only behavior can not be likely to be likely to experience.
The neural comparison continues: rats and humans have similar brains, but sheep are not even a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for receipt?
And even if you could prove this to humans: how were you trying to show it in rats?
I think rats and other sugars, maybe even sheep (who knows?), have receipts.
But I didn't know how to prove that.
And because their receipts are fundamentally different from ours (which is the human consciousness in special circles and languages), I prefer to investigate emotional behaviour than the emotional experiences of rats.
In any case, there are progress on the neural level, if we miss the same thing in rats and people.
As I do not investigate the language and knowledge in rats, even not in receipt, I don't know whether they exist.
You can keep it shortly, but I'm better going to go before than keep running against a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President Uefa Platini: Guideline for Poland and Ukraine
The Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would be submitted soon under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The Government views the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to make EM together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"It's not amnestie for our country.
The work has just started and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the time schedule for the building or rebuilding of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests are behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM states is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose time anymore.
We must now work with the maximum speed," said the Ucrainian President Grigorij Surkis.
"The EUFA will keep us constantly in the eye."
A more radical step was locked in Poland.
The PZPN leadership has been suspended by the National Olympics Committee and was replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was assembled on request by Sport Minister Miroslaw Triovicki.
"The serious thing that the PZPN is not able to act in accordance with the rules," said the PAP Triovicki of the Poland news agency.
"We have made Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several firstlights were condemned only in the past season because of the manipulation of the deficiency, and even the start of the Liga had to be moved shortly.
Recommended Dennis Quaid returns
She wanted to promote a new movie, said in the interview about 日es - and now she had trouble with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan out of her deceased Dennis Quaid as married.
He's crazy, and he's getting back.
Later rosen war at the ex-government Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood Shooters are now an unusual fight - in all public.
Meg Ryan had said in an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week for the reasons for the wedding: "This was my long time unbelieving, and that was very painful."
The measure of disturbance has been experienced only after the divorce.
The case for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for its new film "The Women" - is told the story of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's response to his outing as an unbelieving husband was clearly said "in memory" is it, said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "My repeated time the story of our relationship was repeated and repeated."
It is also "awful" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack will be again "notified publicly to pain and conversion, which means a divorce for each child."
Current Ryan since the divorce is alone, Quaid has been married again and has recently been father of Zwillings.
And thus conclude his authorizations with the side hib: "My life goes anyway.
I appreciate my happiness that I have a wonderful family who is best going."
Sing prices for flight tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnights in Europe were higher than the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even more balanced than 50%.
Flights and overnights in hotels have become more favorable - this is the result of the trip and financial service leader of American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half year 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a clear break in the second quarter.
After the prices in the hotel have been spent for years, the overnights have already been approved in many places.
From January to March, the prices increased in 41 of 48 towns examined by average 6,9 Pro · compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, the prices have been less than in the previous year.
The most clear was the trend in Paris and Rome, where travelers 30 to 37 Pro had to swallow less than one year ago.
As a cause, the American Express sees the weak course that leads to a "absorptive tourist's tourist".
Financial plans such as Frankfurt or London were also more affected by the reduction of hotel prices as industrial levels such as Hannover, Köln or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian City, the hotel prices have a growth of 26.3 Pro · even the record in Europe.
Flight prices also showed the trend in the first quarter:
As a result of cherosin deduction, travelers in the economy class had to be sealed more than 7,1 Pro > 2007, trend-intensive long-stream flights were even more than 29,2%.
From April to June, the prices for flight tickets of the Economy Class were estimated by a average of 12,5 Pro · in comparison with the previous quarter, however, in the business and first-class, the price changes were significantly reduced.
In Germany, the prices are still greater than in other countries:
Since January to March, the prices were estimated at 11,9 Pro, in the second quarter they thought about 23,6 Pro.
Dutch internal flights have even semi-timed the prices.
The reason for the price income is, on the other hand, the economic growth, explained by the company.
The request in many segments of the flight is breached.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalises the air traffic between the United States and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
The signs of the situation are the striking of unprofitable streams in Airlines, as well as the high number of flight companies reported in the first half year 2008 - only in Europe were these 24 flight companies.
HSV Weight Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV is a table leader.

He knows that the tablery mixture is more for the incompatibleness of the Liga than for the domination of his HSV.
The community with its later committed access - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Tors PetProperty and the Jansen from FC Bayern - is still quiet, but it is still not possible.
"We need more Flair and more Dribblings," Jol asked.

Dark material affects the flight of space suns
Since years, a mysterious phenomenon provides for research for advicelessness: Dark material has affected the speed of space suns during the so-called swing-by-manover.
Experts care that the general relativeity theory Albert Einsteins could not be completely correct.
Nearly 18 years, the "Ulysses" room was running through the world room.
Because of quickly-leaving driving driving, you're now wearing the coal.
A mysterious phenomenon for Ververive is the Swing-by-anomalie.
The Swing-by is a flight manager of space-sounds, where they receive adequate weight in the gravitation field of a heavenly body, along with the earth.
This means that the suns can compare many tree materials.
The American Research Society Cassini-Huygen also used this physical trick as the sun Sunday Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have wondered for years: the flight body doesn't act 100-prospectively as it would be expected in accordance with the older gravity law.
Moreover, it comes to irregularities in the speed.
The suns will be unexpectedly faster or lateer.
The physicians could not declare this effect until long.
They baptized him Swing-by-anomalie.
Some experts care that even the general relativeity theory Albert Einsteins, which describes the attachment force of material by the rage, could not be completely correct.
The physician Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton believes that Einstein did not wrong, and trys to explain the Swing-by-anomalie using the so-called dark materials that have exhibited the astronomes in the universe.
"The responsible for the anomalie may be a dark material that could also be close to the earth," he wrote.
From the existence of the dark material, the worldwide researchers know about Â years.
It obviously exhibits an attachment force that allows the effect of other heavenly bodies to be observed.
She is fully invisible, that means, she sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
The dark material always exhibits a fifth of the whole mass of the universe.
Tourists in Egypt are free
After days in their hands, the tourists in Egypt will be free again as the Italian foreign minister.
The exemptors from Sudan had requested several millions of euros.
At a shoot before the release, six enemies should be killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been driven out.
Solutions should already be negotiated.
Germans always returned to Kidnappern Visitors.
WE日 ONLINE shields the most important cases.
Tourists missed in Sahara are obviously free.
This reported the Egyptian state TV, the Arab TV Sender Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
The Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini visited the release by reports of the Italian televisor Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and others have been released.
We just check their health status," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Romanian and their eight Egyptians were safe and safe, reported the Egyptian state TV.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition will already be on the road to Kairo.
The backlines of a shooting before the release of the prisoners continue to continue: then, the deducers were ready to finish the exemption before the Sudanese army murdered overwhelming six deducers.
"The problem was solved.
They were agreed with a ransom," the officer said.
"It was still going to take the ships in receipt," as "This surprise" suddenly came.
Sudan soldiers had shot six deductors on Sunday in the border area between the Sudan, the Tschad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The companioners had requested from Germany a redemption of six million euros; the money should be granted by the German wife of one of the concubines.
The journal "El Masri El Jom" reported in vocation to a German mediator who was released from the prisoners, because the Kidnappers feared their security.
According to the report, the leaders want to release the women's women after payment of the redemption.
The men should be arrested until the drivers had a safe flight road.
The German message in Kairo refused a opinion on the report.
The misuse of the Stifter "leaving to suicide"
Annual misuse by their father has led to a woman's murder, and a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a prison penalty for six years after eight cases of sexual misuse.
The Chairman of Justice in Truro learned that he regularly fixed his daughter Stephanie Randle when she was five-seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a guest, "I feel responsible for her death."
The Court learned that Mrs. Randle was born in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, in age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had been connected with her eyes before she conducted sexual acts, while her mother was left to work in a hospital.
Trerise and his wife are divorced in the 1980s and he returned to Cornwall.
His stive daughter went to Plymouth.
However, the Court realized that Mrs Randle, which was a major part of her time honestly for the National Trust, was persecuted by the misuse, which had been granted her twice in the week.
State lawyer Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who was a zealous surferin and a radical carrier since 2006, had been "emotional dead" and "rejected your life"
In April 2007, her right father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she has killed herself by providing herself through a plastic sack.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's father, who wrote a guest letter, who ended: "I was trying to feed her and join her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise, "You are a extremely comfortable femalesist, and for her sacrifice it must have been terrible, especially because she was just seven.
This uncomfortable story ends with the suicide of the victim.
More bad is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would not be done before the court if she had not done this."
He added: "I know what effects, according to the description of Stephany's father and mother, had their work over the years on their daughter.
Otherwise, she would clearly be a lot promised, happy young woman."
The employee responsible for lost data shall be accused
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer, who had lost extremely confidential documents in a move in June, will be accused of the "Publical Security Act".
The man was ordered by the Defence Minister when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a move to Waterloo.
The documents were transmitted to the BBC before the police was released.
It is the swee accusation within the law and there is no reference to criminal purpose.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said that the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that it would have been inside the Defence Minister and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be referred to shall be accused by paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause which includes the safe storage of information.
The Royal State Advocate recommended that the officer should be accused by the Metropolitan police because of the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he provided included classified assessments on Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqian security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought by house to a secret place.
Apartment building companies see B&B costs in the eye
British building companies could be costs of more than 80 million pounds in the house after Bradford and Bingley Bank were saved.
The Government provided 14 billion pounds to shalt the records of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
The interests for this loan shall be paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including 59 building companies
The Director-General for the Association of Apartments (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "independent" that the companies and their members should be killed.
The 14 billion loans will be finally paid when Bradford & Bingley's credits are acquired.
However, the rates attached to the interim time are calculated each year to the 700 financial enterprises who accept payments.
The programme for the compensation of financial services was involved in the BBC that the 59 apartment building companies were contained in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions who have behaved carefully will now be called to take some of the costs of those institutions that were much less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company in relation to the income that it would have to carry out, and that the companies had to cover about 18% of the costs together.
The Financial Ministry estimates that the rates for the credit will be paid to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the companies have to buy 81 million pounds for the prices of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General for the Association of Apartments, shared the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have behaved carefully during the immobilious creation are now calling for some of the costs of those institutions that were much less careful.
The BSA stated that no company has failed since the records existed in 1945.
"We will see all aspects of this thing in the next weeks to see what alternatives there are to spend apartment building companies and their members of possible significant costs."
The rates which will be covered in 2009 are covered by the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, rates will be rate for a full year, and it could be almost twice so much.
Since building companies are both side-hand organisations without companies, their members must pay for the costs, either by taxes or less rates on spar accounts.

Bangladesh's former Prime Minister of Prime Ministers is rejected.
A court in Bangladesh has rejected an ex-Premier Minister Sheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Her defendants said that the Court of Justice refused to have pressed 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several weak accusations for corruption against them.
Sheich Hasinas, a long-year political Rivale, Khaleda Zia, was released in the beginning of this month against cution.
Sheich Hasina will return to Bangladesh in the next week, but its party, the Awami Bundess, requested that the military transitional government should give its freedom once a limited basis.
The correspondents say that, despite having been granted to go for medical treatment in the foreign land, it is not clear in the framework of their release whether it can continue to stay on free foot when she returns to Bangladesh.
Their advocates indicate that it will now call on the Chief Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The above court has rejected the Court of Justice, because it says that it must not be granted a currency, because she is already on arrest in the outland to be treated in the foreign," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will notify a claim against the above court."
Their advocates claim that they need a cup to return from the outside to the country to prepare for elections in December.
It will be expected that Sheich Hasina will return home after 17 October, a Awami Bundesparty president said on Sunday.
It was arrested last year after the Government of Army undergoing the power, but in June it was released out of prison to go for medical treatments.
Sowohl Sheich Hasina and Khaleda Zia lie all the points of accusation against themselves.

BskyB loses claim in case ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competitive Commission to reduce its share in the competitive sender ITV.
The Court of Competition has ordered BskyB to reduce its contribution to ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.

New research in the US State Advocate Affairs
The General State Advocate has assigned a special officer to take account of the announcement of the nine state consultations in the United States in 2006.
The advice was a report of the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice in which the actions of workers were criticized.
The report was critical to the staff of the Wissen House, legislators and the former General State Advocate Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was carried out by the protections that the lawyers were released for political reasons.
The specialist mediator Nora Dannehy will now be able to dress whether the employees requested during the investigation have enjoined the investigators to prevent justice.
The general inspector Glenn Fine reported that serious crimes have not been completely investigated or claimed, in particular, in the report.
The vocation of a special officer with the power to force the Witnesses to say was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began as the Department of Justice in December 2006, nine of the US State Affairs.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the State advocates would be determined due to weak workshops.
Nevertheless, later, it was found that the decision-making state appeals were not farer than many of their colleagues, which allowed many observers to consider the announcements as politically motivated.
Some of these state consultations were involved in the legal persecution of high-range members of the Republic of Congress, while others refused to investigate the provisions of the elections of the democrats.
The US State Affairs are ordered to examine and follow judicial cases for the Government.
They can be released at any time, but they cannot be abandoned for political reasons.
The former leader of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, has made his office for the decisions and has finally laid down its office.
A number of officers of the Ministry of Justice have also been rejected.
The report of the General Inspector has critically invited Gonzales' role by making the "Main responsibility" for the exemptions, the role of his leadership and the "extraordinary interest" in the process.
Other staff, including the former main adviser of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the employees.
Meat Loafs epical song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf will be honored for his episcopical hymne "Bat Out of Hell".
The song, who will accept his special golden price during the delivery in London, said that he was honest to be recognized.
The song that takes nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title piece of Meat Loafs Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" specifies the nominations for the price delivery of this year after it has come into the widest selection in four categories.
The Chef of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there are some of those who go out of such materials such as time and genre and "Bat Out of Hell" is certainly one of them.

Obskure street in town, often forget and may be quickly overcome
New York City has thousands of main roads, only, pages and other environmental roads, some of which are famous and others are only famous.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to tell experienced taxi-fahrers and long-year-old local sisters where the extra place is, simply because most of them have never heard it.
This winzige street is located in East Village and is spent from the first street to the North direction between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It's 30 feet width and 120 feet long and looks better for a stainful gate than for a active travel road.
There are no streets.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
However, this street has her beauty.
For example, Avalon Bay, a building company that recently built luxurous buildings on the first street.
It wants to replace extra place to create a clean cross-border to the woods and boutics that are expected in the new buildings.
The other worshipers belong to the long-year neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short gate, simply because it is one of the rest of the past of the home block.
However, the town management department, responsible for the protection and creation of the buildings of the buildings of the city, has no interest in getting them.
On a meeting of the Committee on Agricultural Use of the Community this month, representatives of the City Management and Avalon Bay have made a proposal for the purchase of the road through the building undertaking.
However, the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted in the next month, so Susan Stetzer, the circuit responsibility in the community 3.
"Only a little room is in possession of the city and we want to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"It could give a boat to repair the street and bear what Avalon could be accomplished, but we also want the public access to remain guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that the small road is setting new plants and seats, including a cafe, where the company wants to avoid space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street, but it doesn't want it.
"The main advice of Avalon Bay is to renew this falling gas and make it to a public meeting point," she said and said that the city himself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the Department of Construction Protection, was actually the desire of the city to overcome the street and stressed that the task of the Department was better to develop the immobility than to manage.
In comparison with his bunch neighborhood The Bowery, the extra place has kept something from his historical impression.
Some believe that the street has received their name in 1802, as a great farm that belonged to Philip Minthorne, divided between his numbered children and a strong strike country was assigned by no one.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punkrock denkmal, which was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is determined in most of the pictures for the cover of the Alba "Rocket to Russia" of Ramones.
The plant was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The street was filled with shots, lamps and parts of feet, posters, sheets and siles.
Some residents, including the bloggers, who write about the gentrieties of the East Village, have refused the idea of the sale of extra place, with the argument that this public basic piece, as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others praised extra place as a rareness – a practically unchanged splitter of the city that should be left in silence.
Jeremiah Moss, who is the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Klagen: A worst nostalgic cup on the extinction city"), published a part of the talk of the city story about extra place, which was held in the new Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, then wrote: "Extra Place is a small worm of sackgase, which even remains dark over the day and has been known through the rounded metal doors of the storage Halls, closed windows and rain rounds before flying weekly magazines."
With a few exceptions, the street looked exactly before one evening.
A ratte went through the back part of the street, not far from the door that led to CBGB before, where there is a tired clothing business today.
Graffiti was to see on the walls, and a empty bird flash was not far away from a fresh bond of exhausted newspapers.
Some passengers said that they would rarely have followed the extra place, but they suggested that the street could be put up.
Fields, please add that, according to his opinion, some people underestimate the road travel in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, foolish and famous.
Debates on two-fold education: Education in English language environment
In this series of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to two-scale training.
Lance T. Izumi, leader of scientific workers in California and leader director in the field of education sciences at the specific research Institute for Public Policy, is a member of the book "Not as well as you think: why the medium class uses a choice."
The Spanish chooser to speak is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals for education are a typical example for them.
Obama's election campaign recognises that "the probability of removing the school in Afro-American and Spanish students is less than in white students".
To close this performance distance, Obama’s education plan is especially recommended in the training for those who first learn English.
However, the question of Obama is whether its use for the two-scale training that focuses on education in other languages than English is contrary to reduce the distance in school services.
Let's take an example of "Sixth Street Prep", a basic school in Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Spanish and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the students, of whom many have been in the country, learned English.
However, in 2008, surprising 100% students of the fourth class have been tested in Mathea at a good level.
At the same time, 93 Pro’s children from the fourth school year were considered as well.
This amazing success has been achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School sets its focus on review and exercise, on permanent control of knowledge and attitude which does not tolerate exceptions.
Moreover, the school practices the approach to which the education is in a English language environment. This is exactly the point that Obama is to be watched, such as Leader Linda Michaels.
This approach refers to the almost exclusive use of the English language in the School School.
Mrs. Michaels, who refused the idea of two-fold education, told me that the school would have been a significant success with a student who had come from Mexico shortly before. 12 months later, you would be able to attend the class room and not to recognize it anymore.
"It works," she noticed, " it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English teachers?
The school service would easily answer this question, but the educational positions within its own party (the national educational unions have already been undertaken by the idea of two-scale educational training) and its own consequent support for the two-scale educational training predicts about Obama's response.
Since he agrees to learn English, he has recently trivialized the subject, noticeing that people should stop making concerns about the "only English" objective legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must ensure that your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should take into account careful education models that work, rather than to treat them and trivialise them.
Consequently, the oil price renewed the economy
The earthly oil price is on Monday due to the prejudice that even the financial market salvation plan could not be able to restore the economy.
Roh oil-term businesses at the New Yorker Trade Boards have fallen in the early session at $99.80 per barrel.
Since the last month, the price has been acquired of more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the markets have been supported by the financial turbulences at the Wall Street and by powerful wheels in the Golf of Mexico.
After the prices had reached their level of $145.29 per Barrel in July, they fell at almost $90 per Barrel in this month to grow again as a result of the great uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have shown concern again, although the Congress Congress representatives had announced, they would have agreed on the weekend on a salvation plan that should be the greatest in the history.
This message was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, a government notice on Monday, the Citigroup will purchase the banks of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Netherlands and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the Fortis Financial Concern.
After an analysis at Barclays Capital, despite the stressed negotiations found in the weekend and led to a salvation plan, it seems not to be able to survive the vote on the markets.
Since the economic situation continues to be worse, it is expected that the request for goods, including the oil, continues to deteriorate.
Analysts of the German Bank have written in a communication to investors that the prognoses for global capital markets, rates and exchange rates have become uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of good markets, we are most concerned whether the US's virus is spread worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year, and their previsions for the oil and gas price for 2009 are 20%.
Manufacturer recorded by series in the second quarter
Interdependent Shaun Ellis thought he would have seen everything after he was born in the last eighth half years more than everybody else in Jets Tricket.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the Jets converted an unfruitful game into a triumph.
"I never saw something like that," Ellis said.
After a sleeping game between the Jets and the Ar faciena Cardinals, which covered the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-year touchdown, it marked the perfect intake at a afternoon when its developing cooperation had made a rice step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once exploded as an ex-defender and the other times 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I haven't been especially forced," Coles says over the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, whatever people think."
Wayful Favre and Coles Fangen played, the defense of Quarterback Kurt Warner took one to another.
External defensive Darrelle Revis started a disgraced wrath and converted it into a 32-yard-touchdown.
Libero Eriketsith came to another pass and started him.
Linebacker David Bowens then provided a loss of warner.
The last loss of ball, accused of Bowens, was probably the most foolish.
The cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets returned the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 Führ.
That was most of the points that the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the wedding, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, answered "The second quarter or the fourth?"
The answers both, because the Jets left 21 points without one, Mangini said: "Create me, I've enjoyed the second quarter more than the.
Many points have been achieved in short time."
Exhibited beach class shapes his well-tree word
Haile Gebselelassia from Ethiopia has shown again why some of the best long-stream lifting layers all the time after he broke his own record in Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person who created the stream of 42.2 km in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory of the flat course at 2:03:59, the beer class improved its previous result of 2:04:26 in 27 seconds that he had reached in Berlin last year.
In this case, he has built his 26th good-tree word in his multilateral kare, where he has reached at least a world mastership title or set a well-tree word on each street from one miles to Marathon.
Last month, the beer class has released the olympic Marathon in Beijing, from which it may have been overcome in the afternoon that the air pollution could deteriorate its asthma problems.
Instead, he reported for the legal fight in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the goal - the beach class has won a average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per milk.
Since travellers, such as bottle class, and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long-streams, the record time for Marathon has fallen in the past 10 years since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 has won in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After Vig on Sunday, he told the press that he had been able to train a week ago two weeks ago, and that is why he was not able to train.
Obviously he was refreshed after a pause and didn't grow back.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All has gone perfectly.
I took the training again a week ago and had some thoughts today, but at the end of what's fine."
He was criticized for it - especially in Kenya, Ethiopian rivals from East Africa - that he has overwhelmed his rivals, that many of the best Marathontars are generally endangered too much on the railway leaders as if it would be a railway, and puts the world records on the legal battle.
However, this criticism does not hurt the size of breasts as long-stream layers.
Nearly four Kenianers on Sunday, the beach class had reached the center of the streams at 1:02:04.
Two elite lifters from Kenia, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to be able to get out of the beds after the temperators had left.
Something more than three miles before the finish has made his last approach to separate himself from Kwambai, which came as second at 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time about about 5 minutes.
Camathi became the third at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kasachstan and now Germany, has completed a significant year by 2:19:19 that she has shown the most important result of all times.
The well-tree word at 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain.
In the last holiday, the 36 years old Mikitenko had overrashed the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She has lost the games in Beijing because of problems described as back pollution. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her real Marathon for five minutes.
She has sent her run by putting a quarter from ethiopic and kinetic lowers first, but overlayed after 30 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second at 2:21:31, while Helena Cyprus from Kenya came as a third in 2:25:01.
The foolishness and the strapages in the lives of the black population, in a city of a very special species
Hidden between the expansions of the free time parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, sounding and gigantic drivers, is a strong city in which the stupidity and the complexity of the African culture appears.
Eatonville, the first totally black city in the country and the home city Zora Neale Hurstons, is not so easy to describe such as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 sea, three crocket places, 300 brain hairs, 300 good swimming, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today, it's a pilgrim.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are at the annual Zora! Festival came in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, it is and remains the city that she described – which made her to a tourist output, taking it into the Florida Travellers, which was produced at the time of the depression by the Federal writer project – in many ways a place of the very special type.
Eatonville is so independent, dead and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their real thoughts with the whistle man who "so little knew about us that he didn't know what happened to him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential officer, Senator Barack Obama, calls to a open talk about race conditions, many are still sorry to be observed by foreigners.
"We are very proud about how our story is spoken," so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and the congregation member of the oldest church of the city.
It must vote."
Eatonville was defined as a paradox of the triumph and the battle.
It is both a historical example of black movement and a community of almost 2.400 inhabitants where the poverty quota is doublely high as the average country.
On the other hand, it is an hochburg of the literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes honored - black culture of the southern country, which has its roots in the slavery.
It's not surprising that the inhabitants here are hot and hot.
And the thoughts about Eatonville's image began with Zora, as all of us calls Hurston.
She presented the world her home town in books that came from hearts and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five parts in the Florida Traveller changed the city that is close to the road 77, a street that leads through the often forgotten centre of Floridas to the shapes of black story and human drama.
Frequently as Oskar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston Reader led to the load of Eatonville's first citizen, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private issues.
"From the street to the left," she wrote, "is the braun - wise modern school, with its wooden gardens and game places, so that Howard Miller always cares, although he can't read and write."
She also discovered the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Geträ every kind of excited and fitting what-up-time rooms to hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston also held Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a traveller.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was estimated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," so the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls, forbid the Hurston by quoting the men, Li's songs about their beautifulness, full of sexual advice.
They said, "Many people didn't like this."
There are still reminders of Hurtson as a living exemplary, who regularly returned after her family was held to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston was broken into the city, she did this most without warning, in a lowly chevrolet, smoking and clothing, in a city that himself is instructed today on her honest style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most people were fascinated, however, many of them were deceived.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But " she never remained too long," he looked up while he looked in chair, on a terrace behind, looking at the Sabelia See, in the Hurston of all probability was baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and lost her books.
Along with the major part of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was one of the famous authors, a wedding of Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in 1920, she was employed in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no large memory fee, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or their inheritance in the garden," so Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", was published in 2003.
The wall came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-speed car car car through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the late two-speaking main roads of the community.
Orlandos Preortes have already driven the car car 4 through the west town border.
The proposal was submitted, when Eatonville still retained from a weak phase in his history.
Zwangs integration, including, had ended the relative idylic isolation of the community.
In the 50s, the fight against racial mixture hated in the Community.
"In this time, a crowd of white boys often came and they threw orphans and appeal to the people who are disfellowshipped," said Mr. Franklin.
"It was even a woman who was killed there.
They threw a water melon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston asked in a letter to the Orlando Sensennel the request of the Supreme Court of Justice to strengthen integration by providing its decision in the case of Brown against the School Council as "consciently place my race respecting."
Today, people say that, despite the decline of race-running in some ways, they have weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of their youths.
"Chirty kids were used to be armed - I reminded of it - being endeavored to his teacher on the morning and injured his teacher at night," as N. Y. Nath≤, daughter of Ella Dinkins and director of the employee group for the protection of Eatonville Community.
This could be obtained uprightly so long as the teachers and teachers had come from the same place.
"Man didn't worry about his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural cloud," said Mrs. Nath.
However, citizens' rights have made a place for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, showers and artists who were moved over prejudices, as it did, with positive self-consciousness and sayings such as: "How can anyone refuse my society's joy?
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made himself on the way to Hurstons unnamed grave and began to fight for the restoration of her glory.
Five years later, a very promised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was to find in the book lines and made it again part of the literature canon.
The telestrate project came exactly at a time in the most famous daughter of Eatonville again in the light of the public.
And this time the old neighbors of Hurstons saw them as a salvation.
In 1988, the community started planning a Hurston Festival to show what the area could be made with the building of the car rental.
Thousands of fans came to the earlier event two years later, and many return to the festival every January.
A few years later, the area turned away from his road buildings.
"The plans of a five-speaking TV strategy deployed the city, cleared the whole speed of spitness, wake up real citizens," said Ms. Nath.
Mrs. Boyd's something easier to say, "Zora salvated Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has a change in the town's self-image.
There were more and more tourists, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who went to the church since 1993, and inhemic began to reapproval the past.
Eatonville was recorded in 1998 in the historical government of the country.
A new instinctive library (otherby called Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly designed and disappointed Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is like a behaviour in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlandos town City is able to feel like an intergase in the sommer round as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(He's 90% black today.)
External search for the history of Eatonvilles and its importance are often still treated with precaution.
For most interviews, an approvement in the field is needed and certain things - as the wall decoration of Eatonville's elderly church, which was drawn by a knowledge and represented by black men in the field work - cannot be photographed.
In Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a love for dark root, still protects her disappointed community.
Yet, at the same time when the Hurston festival was increased, a higher degree was also born in the household.
In particular, young people refer to seeing Eatonville as Hurston saw their whole race: wonderful, with all his problems, not bad or better and exactly proud, creative and flexible, albern, and mixed as any other race and people in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's neighbors, the 18-year Edwin Harvey, who wants to return after the college to Eatonville to work in the town management or police, which can sound help him.
And even the disciples, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old whillings from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville properly.
"The most people who just go through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon recently said on Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, you're talking flexiblely to the financial late.
Nothing has changed on the first corner.
If tourists in Manhattan were remote from the magazines and the violent television screens in Times Square, they would not remember that they were in the middle of a debat.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shooting offices with the glass fashions, bankers and He-fond managers who have the Monopol in New York, each day have the worst day of horror work since 1929.
The suppliers still carry the metal teewagen at the top of citizens and transport tablets loaded with muffins for the early meetings.
Latinos still sleep around the apartments, as human agents loaded with about the 50-founded T-shirts, which depend on one joch-like stage on their walls.
Office officers still wait for foods on the citizen levels on their breakfast, and it is still impossible to get a gel taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19 hours.
It didn't feel like a crisis until Thursday after Thursday I started to open a new spar account because of all the world passengers.
Although I had completed my obligation to put my obligation on the hard afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase stamfiliates, there were some 20 people snow.
Not to pay or pay money to the money keys, but to the customer service switcher where staff books are commanded, tourists ask the way to purchase Macy's and open new customers accounts.
Most of them before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee with licence", were from the same reason as I had snow.
However, in contrast to me, they have already rejected their apartments from smaller banks, in places from which they were pending, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and State Island.
They had money from such triffs (a little bit of building park), genocide banks and local sparcases that have only in a state are denied and say they treat their customers as a family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have passed quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with 327 billion dollars, in competition management and as last Friday New Yorker went home for weekend, was Wachovia, another bank, the 440 billion dollars, on the search for a saved buyer.
In fear of another injury, the officers and laden officers stood before me to a bank that will be considered secure, a bank responsible for the majority of salvation sales in the Wall Street.
In the last weeks, the normal New Yorkers have reached the financial latin.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese tribe supper, with so much confidence, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank and its presidential Dick Fuld, as if she had learned about a fake colleagues.
And Lyn, which, around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my residence block, has come from our usual discussions about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I now have all my reliefs in money funds" she told me after my wedding at the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going in risk anymore."
Muslim graves sent during the legal route in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a Left Director of the Austrian Right of Liberty Party of Austria, and Philip Dewinter, member of the Belgian Right Pertei Vlaams, takes the meaning on Thursday 17 January 2008, in a demonstration in Antwerps to represent the organization "Steds against Islamization".
She's shields in the style of the rubber characters on which a moschee is drawn through with a red line.
The police accuses the right extremistes of the graves on a Muslim Friedhof in Austria, the same weekend, to the extreme right parties, of the country's election.
On Friday night tomorrow, more than 90 funers were charged on the Friedhof in Traun at Linz in a, sound police, organized action.
The teasers shot Jewish symbols like David Stars on some of the graves, but criminal officers keep this as an attempt to distort the motive of the extremistes taken by hate to Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the case is in any way related to the choices.
A speaker of the local islamic community said that it was "increasingly disturbed" about the message of the grave scandal, which placed as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadans at the end.
At the same time, in Austria, there is a conscious investigation after the country was moved to the right of the parliamentary choice.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, both parties who received nearly 30% of the votes, were put into their choice fight for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their elections were criticized by enemies as an alien.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the FPÖ, who wined 18% of the votes, set up for a prohibition of heads and Burkas and even made his refusal against food that is generally connected to Islam.
In his latest pursuit in Vienna, he spoke of a "every brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the building of moschees and mines with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous islamization of Austria and Europe.
Questions and analyses, which have been carried out immediately after the choice and who have noticed that the extreme rights of the political highest block are in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel lock for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who was condemned by the sexual misuse of children, was judged to travel to France and Spain.
The judge made a six-month block, after informing his control authorities, he wanted to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent was granted the last Thursday to deal with a foreign traveller after she presented the judges evidence of claims to Glitter's prejudice because of sexual misuse of children.
Glitter, a right named Paul Gadd, lived not at the Ashford official court in Kent, but was represented by the Corker Binning Corker's legal office.
A Officer of the Court of Justice reported: " On Thursday, on 25 September, the Police Kent requested the authorisation of Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain to the 25th March.
Paul Gadd was not personal."
As required by the director for sexual criminals, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel outside.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel out for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned abbreviation.
The derogation of the notice of the authorities may lead to a 5-year prison penalty.
The police in Kent said she would not discuss any cases or places of residence in the country.
A speaker of Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to slip children in this country and outside."
"Our view is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the top of the police in Kent to slip the people's Kents, and we work hard together to monitor the behavior of registered sexual criminals in the country in order to minimize any risk that could be for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he delivered 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for misuse of 2 girls in the age of 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he fled glitters to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to flee to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the pass control, and he fled after some and Her to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to return to Bangkok, where the Thailand police and border officers claimed that he returned to the United Kingdom.
To a good late, he arrived on 22 August 3 in Heathrow, and stayed there during his legal lawyer David Corker went to the court of Uxbrie in West Londres, since Scotland Yard ́ had requested the authorisation, to ask him to register himself as sexual criminals.
Glitter was arrested in 1999 for four months in the United Kingdom for the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Internal Ministry, the Internal Ministry of Jacqui holds and satisfies that glitters were left to travel to France and Spain.
'I'll receive the master behind the boat to keep his character', Günter Brauer, photograph.
No breaks, no rice, no costs for the emergency.
The nature of the big flame cottoners, who swift to the consolidation and spread the interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or a man.
One Side Artist
Personality Others
I look into life in these moments, which are foreign for the public, I know when I can find the depth of a closed box or the deepness of the hands that are concerned because they do not come to the boat.
Inside the project `Flamenco-people', the German photograph Günter Bauer provides theatralic of some inscenations on the boat with songs, dancers and gitarristes. On this side, he was still small for artists.
With this proposal, the photograph creates a specific icon of the presentation of flame codes at different levels.
The exhibition that belongs to the moon of the photography of Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which will always increase from day to day, explains the artist and clears that 'Flamenco-people' can be a popular man, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical pictures of artists on the top.
All normal people on the portrait are artists who are able to be on the front patience, triumph to provide joy and to move the public.
To maintain the personality of these artists, you do not have to make photos on the front.
Her personality and her characters are in their hearts.
What I was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would enable me to keep the characters of the largest flamecomesters with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the Festival `Cante de las Minas', made himself a long journey in 1997 to photograph the songs, the GÃ©sts or the dancer with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera's sorting function and the existing material, pictures occurred that remind the classic photograph.
The application of various stylists is the classic basis of the image, which provides the modernity and idea of how the builder Flamenco understands: `Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
This is not only the dance, the agang or the instrumental game, but the personality of the artist, his character, which transfers the public with his art.
The search for the essential, according to a certain thing that will be visible in the form of hearing, is and was the solid goal of this work that will be presented next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Known persons in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the close choice of almost seventy artists.
The project was made to an anthology of Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Buyer's patience to the portrait led him to take up this idea two years ago and to perform as 'portart project' as a portrait of the veterans of the sport.
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photograph to `I like to photograph the people, to know them and to move me in their life condition, if it's for a short moment or a longer time.
I think the portrait in the area of the photograph is the most difficult gatting.
You're going to meet yourself or break on persons, personalities you sometimes do not know, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to make a photo.
Except these circumstances, as a photograph, I always try to perform my ideas."
The assembly of the Portrait of Flamencos from today with the title `Flamenco-people' is published in the Galeria of El Fotomata, which is located on the street with the name la calle de la Mata and relies parallelly to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be viewed until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa believes that the Roman, who he just writes, is a tolerance.
He doesn't know where the Romans' action is located and what it is, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to provide a Roman with the Protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, who lived twenty years in the Congo and went into the Amazon area.
Tonight, during his presence on Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel pricemakers admitted that the project with which he is occupied is `a tolerance' and 'all indicates that he should not write the Roman'.
'If I had visited, I wouldn't have done it, but I'd hope to end the Roman once, so he took his participation in the Festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists, and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La city y los perros' was one of the most excellent personalities on the festival and made proofs.
Vargas Llosa, the premium of the Festival Hay Festival, and gives the majority of the presents their voice, is compared to the old exhibition of `Our mutual friend' and is to see in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and said that he had a public before himself, which noticed that the Peruanian who was a wonderful memory and a great humor feeling had not been given enough time to overcome everything again: how his vocation to literature occurred from `excellent aventure loss', from `Freude on read' and `more `s wishing to experience than before'; as he writes and `Diselalin holds' to add `the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documents, numerous corrections and processes that he makes; such as the fascinators, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas, and which are the foundations of his history.
The Spanish Roman writer concluded that there is no way to measure and how to know whether books can change life, but I refuse to believe that the literature is pure interview, a flexible experience,”, noted Vargas Llosa, who claims that it makes `effects' and `the people brings more', so I asked the writers `sickness' and 'the responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pooblanco, the weather was not played with: Steel campaigns fell partly out.
Following the announced steer travellers, the ground of the place was in bad state, the steel campaign was carried out tomorrow morning.
Thus, with the understanding of Fermin Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and ↑ Hernández, he decided to move the steer camp.
Thus, the festival of the inconsistent warning was exhausted, so two of the three feasts were not able to be placed.
On Saturday, it was not able to make the second planned campaign.
The group of matadors was of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who followed and followed the campaigns.
So there was just a party on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who split three ears and triumphed after which he had left the course with joy and astetic.
At the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two corners and one ear of the steer, which was more galopped by him than by his carrying art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without honour.
After he had so bad anxieties, a majority of the public reacted in the second battle with Buh-Ruffen.
In Álava two persons wanted to escape the control of their car, which was charged with two thousand kilo hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Vertigo controls in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon (Alava).
Two police officers asked the drivers to stop the car, and they took the flight.
It seemed that they should not stop with the loading of more than two thousand kilo hashish.
The police persecuted her and established one of the drivers, the man who was 28 years old, as A. A. J., as it notified the Inner Ministry of the Basque State.
The determined person was accused of trade and falsification of documents.
The incident occurred when the police officers of the region of Álava had already completed the control of the depth on the N-1 and passed through the city of Arminon.
They decided to keep a car to perform the road controls. The driver did not follow the instructions, he immediately increased the speed and tried to delay the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped a few miles at the border street. At the moment, the drivers went out of the car to flee through a country road into a forest area.
The police of the city Ertzaintza included one of the two. In the car, a Iveco Daily, transported 2,178 kilo Haschisch, which was arrested by the police.
The first part of the car was loaded with hashish bounds, which later were led to precise lab analysis and the transfer of the bonds to other police offices.
The employees determined that the character `double' was so that it was not compatible with the character set out in the Kfz paper, so it was appropriate to make an arrest for the falsification of documents.
The police of the city Ertzaintza continues to investigate the arrest of the second convictor who could, as already known, flee, but also determine the origin of the hosts.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. was brought to a police office, and it is transferred to the Court in the next hours.
Heather Locklear's viewer was found because of the drive under the effect of an unknown medication.
The shower Heather Locklear, which is the role of Amanda from the "Melrose Place" series, was found at this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) because of the conduct under the effect of an unknown medication.
A Witness has observed how she attempted to run out of her parking holiday in Montecito, reported speakers of California's police to the magazine `People'.
The Witness reported detailed that Locklear `from 16:30 was made by gaspedal and many warmings by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking hour, and when she was backward, she was sometimes at her sun-brell.
Something later the Witness saw that the first player had probably not recognized that Locklear stopped on a nearby street and went out the car.
The Witness was the person who announced the needs because she had lived for Locklears.
When the police officer arrived, they found the player sitting in her car, which was quite strange on the street, and thus blocked the rubber.
'They seemed unoriented,' so they put the police in a special range of alcohol and alcohol to test.
According to a police speaker, the co-operative, excessive alcohol genetic player has been excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of the employees have been followed, we believe that Locklear is under the influence of an unknown medical campaign', as the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the detention of conducting under the influence of an unusual substance which could not be determined and brought to a local investigation at 19 hours.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the clinic in Arëna, where it was treated against the most depression and situations.
Llamazares are to be responsible for the andalusian association of the United States Links for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and the United States Links, has now assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former town of the Rathuses Council in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was returned last week after he was accused to make business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federerist, and the andalusian organization will be the one who has to take the responsibility for it, the Llamazares show what steps the party must have towards him who is sitting as a city Council in the community of Sevilla.
However, the chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible surveys of the rules of violations that Silva could have started: 'The VL continued to have such cases the maximum transparency.'
In view of this subject, he noted that the education has a strict ethical code for all public issues.
`Sangre de Mayo': Heldenbook of Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' represents the above version of the famous rebellion of Spain against the French. This is a wonderful film in the film, with about 15 million euro investment for the road work.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to present a number of personalities and social analysis, which he has always wondered on the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci today explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevaria at the beginning of a long directory of the representatives.
`Sangre de mayo' with a length of more than two and half hours, this Friday is presented in China and later shown on the sender Telemadrid as a four-hour ministry.
José Luis Garci, the large fan of the Literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this triple work went in Erfungsung. This he thanked Esperanza Aguirre, which commanded him from the autonomous Community Madrid three years ago to rotate a memory movie on 2 November in Madrid. In particular, because the story was based on `Episodios Nationales', he accepted the task.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made by the Autonomous Community Madrid for Roadwork, offers Garci, as he added, the "single opportunity" with the help of Decora and the corresponding clothing of the `forbidden Spain, which was designed by the false leader for the battle because the people had been represented by the fight for independence and under the Government of the Ferdinand of the VII.
However, the Cineast deteriorates that with financing such as `Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times high as at 'Sangre de Mayo'), some scenes from the Rohbook with Horacio Valcárcel, with Garci, were not able to be rotated with the garci almost all his carrie.
For this reason, Garci, who was also director of the film in 'Volver a empezar', has been involved by his usual work: he has set up on the boards to the players with which you must first try before turning, and for those who have not made casting, he appears `depreciating' and respecting, 'a part of the professional of the film director is to allow help in the theater and in the cinema to know what happens in the cinema industry in which you do'.'
The representatives on which he supports 'Sangre de mayo' must repeat before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar-Kandidate in four nominations (of whom he has won), has assured that no of the three candidates representing Spain in this year before the Aëmy of Hollywood represents a young generation of the Spanish film. No 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Seat mesas de billar French', nor's' the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect exhibitions for this film.
'And at the beginning you believe that you work for the seed, later you realize that it is only for the behaviour, and now you are satisfied when you have produced another film,' Garci explains professional activity after more than 30 years.
Isabel Bayón calls the reminder of the dancer from Sevilla Tortola Valencia
A flamencottener from Sevilla honors a dance that also comes from Sevilla.
Carmen Tortola Valencia: Her father was Catalana (Florenz Tortola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusierin (Georgina Valenzuela), she was born in the fourth Triana and when she was three years old, her family was about to London.
She was a dancer and expert for oriental dance.
She had an embarrassing life, she was one of the first battles for the Eman's women's life, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhistin, Vegetarian, and seated for the decreasing of the corset, which restricted the free women's movement.
The life of this woman, who left her tracks in the Dance and Esthetic Revolution in Europe at the time between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa’oa and she proposed to me this role, which is impossible for me.'
"We do not try to tell her life to keep her spirit," said the flamecottener.
Your dance bases helped me very much in Flamenco.
'The Dance of the Smetterlings', for example, came to me like Guajira, or 'the Dance of Slanges' like Tango.
Her dance was significant and it was told me that my dance is also in this esthetical area, it claims it.
The insertion calculates two exceptional cooperation: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of its imaginations, as he also did in `La puerta opena'; and with Flamenco Master Matilde Coral, which would have to work with one of its ex-schools.
`Matilde plays Tortola, a very strong personality.
I am happy because she was agreed to do my work, and I feel very honest."
The inscenation also calculates the musical composite and the GÃ©ste Jesus Torres and ̈o Arriaga, with the angle of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the cooperation with the show player Juanfra Juarez, he overcomes the role of the artists who were divas in which he always relyes.'
In this work, there is also a certain way of life of this woman, which has been in places such as India, the United States or Russia and also in Europe, although it has usually lived in London.
`I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she is one of the women who have a great influence on a certain period and their works today no more, and that is why they are less appreciated,' says Bayon.
The presentation will be located at 20:30 in the theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recent marido' also includes the three
The presentation of the first illustrated version of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez 1916, Zenobia, offers a corresponding atmosphere to perform the planned Aeuten in the mission of the Andalus Council for Culture to celebrate the `Trien' of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is the memory of the fifty-year Jubileum of the Literaturnobel Price and the death day of the two.
Thus `the Trinity of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new exhibition of this work, with the international congress that is located in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the walker exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'A chopo de light' opened in May and, after which it was in different places in Andalusia, New York has now reached and is presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pedro Taberero. The goal is to make the person and the work of the andalusian worldwide.
The United States can imagine badly without Paul Newman
Many times God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This set comes from the spectacle Sally Field, with him in the `sension reporter', and from the American China's representation, which was then left, from all America to Newman, and followed her.
Now see what she costed to deliver him to Oscar.
And when he returned to 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Yet, it was a great shot for everyone.
'What feels sometimes is essentially more than a expression, and now I lost a big friend,' Robert Redford said weeping, 'my life and my country were the greatest distress of his life.'
No one had to make it sorrow or overcome.
As `Father' of the China and the country of the father, he died in a terrible moment in which he belongs to terrorists and the market association, where the lowly self-valuable feeling of the US-Amer in the unexpected search for reasons to retain worth.
If there are only few people that can be wondered in this hard time, you must not be Luis Cernuda absolutely to love Paul Newman.
For all, he covered almost a platformic idea of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and was founded as different losses as well as wins: by the establishment that has foretold the fight against the − and to honor his son from the first marriage, who died at overdose, has been founded up to its own mark of householders and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country in which it costed much effort to take place against a deathly nutritional culture.
A wide whale of the surprise is high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, Daniel's English, was aware that not only one man died but all the time.
The English Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prices, said that the work with Newman was not more or less than the top of his car.
Property Crowe, the wicked boy, who came out, waited for Newman to be his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the biggest of all of us', George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who try to live today as Paul Newman lived: receive high requirements for justice, a responsible life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's median angle.
But there's someone who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He separated himself once and then was fifty years later married with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although there was certainly a lot of opportunities to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have Filet home?' he often scattered himself.
In heaven, he will be proud of that his daughters on earth have the same thought as his fans, which is not usually in America.
'From all the great roles that he played, he was not so proud as the faithful marriage, the loving Father, the attentionful opas, and the Philanthropes', they say.
For the Olympics games, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to make some olympical disability lines in Madrid, after the floor for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask me, 'Will we prepare for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say it's not right!
She was stuck as a perfect road, and after my evaluation, she was the worst road with all the drum and dress that was.
Of course, this is a lot of uncertainty if you were to look at the assessment and I could check it, that would not have been clearly.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The whistle starts with the ticket hall that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to be bad to me, but if they let you go, then they should also give you everything (including Chip to avoid the stone on the street).
So not.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first uncertainty that is in it to go soon) and (after an infinite speech) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second uncertainty because I need the size of XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only smaller, much more billiged hair from smaller substances?
Well, things like these are a smallness compared to the days on the street.
Unless you have to go very early to get the chip, there's already a waiting shadow for at least 15 minutes and, too, you have to leave the crack.
The wait has longed more than 35 minutes, which in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected, is uncertain.
As it was to expect, the street started and we hadn't let our backs go before, even if it had been done once, but it would have been weaker.
✔ In these 40 minutes it seemed to wait after rain, so it was attempting to organize a people's rebellion and to overcome the wound.
I think tomorrow, some 500 people will certainly have long-break and some like I'm going to be for this chip that I have received, not even at the time of the classification, I can think that the outcome has been wrong-stocked.
Of course, if you were to ask me about a perfect road, this street would never touch me.
So I think we're still gonna dream from a city that is well prepared for the Olympics games
Microsoft on search for a (virtual) receptionist
On the 'Emerging Technology Conference', which is MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image identification system and the human intervention, a way of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is able to perform some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a routine planner to move on the campus of the company). The system observes what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form- and visual recognition system, these 'receptionists' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand their chat.
It can also set the presents in the groups according to the talks.
In the presentation video, `the recipients' notice a person, but it understands that this person is not associated with the group that leads to her, and that it is not a company employer.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will be listening soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to be able to do, for example, to the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week you were very overwhelming about Microsoft's change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer suggested that if the computers were equipped with the most needed, instead of filling them with the commercial M., they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be only for the waves.
Everything is only a finding if you mention that Microsoft in Windows versions is a function and 'Extras'.
The direction change is revoked
The Microsoft has the right to lose the operational system of significance, exactly as the software.
When Google Chrom appeared in the network, it was a part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to competite with Windows.
Many show that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an inappropriate part, will always be necessary to work hardware and software simultaneously.
The operational system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or his husband if it is to inform his mother.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think of his 'Death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the performance of this idea.
People give less attention to the operational system every time, for more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to execute the Firefox, Explorer or Chrom and each day we take more time on the surf than in the 'Window' environment.
For what help does the computer provide available applications?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be compacter, much more compacter than view.
Lighter, not so overflowed, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more in integrating his online services that can then become the alternatives to Google.
In fact, they need this, without doubt, and I bring a little example of it.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the repeated rooms for Microsoft employed at the beginning of the month.
On the refrigerator auto is a gun fixed: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent section concluded that the 66% of the employees in Microsoft, Google used for network research.
Moreover, last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has also been reported in the late.
It will not begin, but the end of 2009 will appear until 2010.
Microsoft looks for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso engaged it in Costa A ́, and Caprio had this mark in `Blood Diamond' of Edward Zwick, just as Al日ino in 'The Pate' of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to the clothes of a well-built pair.
If we start counting the innumerable stars emergences, we can return to the picture of a very powerful man, with a beautiful bar that had highlighted weight weights in a wander circle.
In fact, it is a typical man-shirt of the tree-wall, unarmed and tailed.
The English speakers call it `tank'. However, the Fabuleux Marcel de Brussels exceeds all other marks.
First, because of his great name, it was called 'Marcel' in a circle. The legend told that the name exhibition is connected to the sport and the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lovers of the song Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surprises all of them because of his excellent treewall, because of his different unisex shirts, and exhibits it through a small belgian fashion (as recognisable) which have these T-shirts as a detail in the cold.
And respect, the Belgian company can not only refer to the production of `tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kashmire, Hoses from Baby Wool, T-shirts with strips, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and famous subweights.
In fact, it's very damage to use it as a sub-kleeting.
You're very proud.
I will be a young mother; I will not be worried for the Candidate.
Her great attitude with her sister did not prevent her to develop her own personality.
Monica'z is great, but full of life's joy.
Currently, the sister Gruz takes their new activities very seriously.
For Monica, this is essentially more than for some beautiful and rich meals that keep their call.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, where she leaves her apartment and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in the area that sponsors the Spanish house.
Barmherzig and swimming, winners on the short streets.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this herbst/Winter Season, which my sister and I discovered Penélope for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second issue of `Mango Fashion Awards' and shared in the dinner to Valentinos honor.
A very intense worktime, which is upset at the same time.
You work for the Spanish House, what is the foundation of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and the 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a town and watch women as they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Tanzer, shower and soldier, you're a very multilateral woman, isn't you?
I think yes, but s, everything is in one area, and these areas have many communities.
Since I was small, I was disappointed by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to feel in the clothes of my tattoo and see their clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a free time park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to look at the clothes.
You know, we can dancers so much to have our own style in education and at the tests to look at the spike and feel well.
As a shower, when you get the costume, you move to the real role of presentation.
S satt, everything is connected together, it is so much respect for the cost designer and their professionality.
You got 30 years ago, didn't you get in a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever than 30 years old.
I think the woman gets reef, has experience and can enjoy life with less errors.
I don't have anything to do because of my biological hour.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was small, and that gave me much more inner joy.
So, you think to be a mother, right?
For a long time, I know that I will be a mother, because this is my body's request, and I will be a young mother; I will not let it go.
As regards the Kandidat, I don't worry about it.
I'll give my child a lot of happiness and learn it with much love.
As regards the film art, you keep in the eyes the works in which you shared and turned the last year.
That's exactly this, and I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very insatisfactory and I want to have everything once that, of course, cannot be immediately.
I wish `The last hour' and 'En search de la tuba de Christ' are first listed.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago, you've been shot with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say something like that.
It's not that I went to the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I have known for a while, has simply called me and invited me to London to share in a parade for the welfare of their organization 'Free for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothes from our collection for Mango were increased to collect the money for Naomis NGO.
The people don't know Naomi's heart.
I, as the one who knows, would tell you that they don't agree.
However, I will submit this matter to which it is shared.
She asked me to share in the Paradise for this great thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstock, I will also do that.
To subscribe to women in the third world, whatever is needed.
The cars that can be repeated due to the alcohol level will need to install the 'Alcolock'.
The Authority recommends that the driver who had three official penalties due to the alcohol level installs inside the car of this system, which offers him to start the car in a drinking state. If he is alcoholized, the car will not be thrown.
The initiative has been announced in June last month and is now part of the report of the General Advocate of the State.
The aim is to resocialize the driver, therefore it is a course for the transformation of the behaviour.
Besides the General State Advocate, accordingly, will participate in the Ministry of Department and the establishment of the Technical Institute for Car Safety.
According to statistics, between 30 % and 75 % of the car vehicles, shown more than one time due to alcohol influenza, replaced on tax.
The `alcolock' would prevent it because it is a system connected to the car, it loses the alcohol content in the spread air and prevents autostart when the driver has tested alcohol; or if a alcohol control is detected which is permitted.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are covered by those who commit the sanction.
In this context, a rate conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars already equipped with these devices are preventing up to 65% of the rules of violation in the first year.
In Spain, 115 people can be saved annually.
The measures are limited to administrative acts for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it becomes a penalty.
In order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the usual way, however, a reform of the basic law is required for the penalty process.
The device is still on the Spanish markets, not available in any business, although it has already been built in some use vehicles and vehicles of the public verification.
Tomorrow, the lawyer's house will be voted because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Working Party, which proposes to install this system in school buss. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British point, at 17:40 a.m., for the time scheduled by the programme, besides the Presidenal depth of the Airport Benito Juárez de Mexico DF, the aircraft of Spanish air weapons traveled with the prince and prince of Asturies.
The sun went down, but its stars still forced to use the hand as sunlight to see the kingly couple that came out of the flight.
Direct at Gangway: the Spanish Messenger and other authorities
A few hours ago, I had asked a taxi traveler on the street whether he knew that the prince and the prince of the Assyrians visited the city to formalize the official trips.
- Ah, very well, so, you can't take people from here or so.
No, she's the Spanish, but she has been here for a few years.
- But so, very good.
But the Mexican Press knows exactly who the prince and the princes of Assyria are and knows the importance of traveling.
There are many who wait in the Hangar of the Flughafen and the Red Teppich, including military protection of 27 soldiers of the Marine.
The prince seems laughing, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long hair weakened by the wind, without usual `peep-toes', may have been told her that it is expected to be a victor in DF.
Before they arrive in the Hall, they laugh and are prepared for the photographs in which the official result is expected.
At the door of the hotel where they are undertaken, one of the four largest in the town, waits for a reporter from the Mexico TV that will make a screen.
The best premium of the
Probably there was no more appropriate place in the world than Paris to present a premium of the → and probably there was no significant designer and bonvivantes than Valentino.
Mango presents the second exhibition of the lawbewerbs `el Boton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for support and international increase of young speakers.
This is exposed to a price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first department, has seen its designs in the Mango window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and has almost weighted because of emotional relief.
In addition, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sale area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest business is located in London.
So many events have occurred that are connected to the designer Valentino for his jury president in the competition. Everything ended with a Luxus dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surrounding of many famous people, it seemed to be a speech-cultural table, organized by Mango.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken from the pain because his brother died shortly. He set up the cup from the house and some nice things of ELAH, which were atember-up. He kept on his son's arm, Luis, who is almost two meters big and Valentino at the dinner, with his honor.
Andik, the owner and Lord of Mango's house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended with the Baron of Red Schild without the Jacketts, because Jacketts have left the lady.
Monicac, who had a shot and a hole, which she had modeled, and at dinner she brought a long, black sexy clothes. When a night pass through the opers, with Goya Toledo, she showed us a salon for ballet tests, so she was in excitement, recalled the old times, attacked a stone and made a kind of `grand pie'.
Inés Sastre, she didn't reach the past through the spaces of the palace, but she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning, we were able to enjoy the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always calls a storm of disgrace, and on Jon Traë, who has requested to have a room in Paris, after his arrival (with his own beds and hands) in the International Hotel in Paris.
The stars under the starful heaven of Paris.
Oh la, that's life.
1001 Council against Stress
There is no 1000, but a more opportunity to forget the chaotic life of the racial daily.
And if there are few, all are gathered in a book where it is how to come to rest. The book comes to the booking processes on 30 September.
The wecker is a chastisement when he sounds at 7 hours tomorrow, but the imagination is still worse to come into the hectac Rhythmus, which requires the current life.
The office is the spending and the computer that leads to the back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21th century.
But there are not one and two methods to cope with the daily creation and the problems that you disable from the work world.
But the number grows, not less than 1001.
Besides Yoga stations, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott provides in the book the entire list of options adapted to the shadow and time of each individual.
The work against the stress is `1001 opportunities to relaxate' and thus the rest that the book provides in the booking processes from Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who thinks it is impossible to get rest in areas such as workplace with personal contacts, this manual reflects such faith.
The methods are offered to remain in contact with nature or to propose the 100% natural recepts that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenalin in your vene no longer grows up to restore the body balance and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to pass on the sofa, disable the brain and can be reading.
Talk in the sleep
Some Children Talk night
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened on the day before, but the children who speak during the sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be worried, but in fact it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleepstock, which is called the speaking in the sleep.
She is very broad, especially in children and youths.
Of course, more than one of you was told that you were talking tonight.
This phenomenon may sometimes occur (one time in life, for example during the high fiber), or regularly (all day, one time a week, one time a month), the child can not be reminded of anything on the next day.
There is no only reason that causes this appearance.
Combinations are often searched for associations with other appearances in sleep, such as alptroms, panicals at night, Enuresis noctura (slaughter night), talks in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have already learned before, it can lead to a very high fiber, stress situation or transfer.
In any case, it's a little research phonomy.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak hardly in individual words, flourish, or it can be an opposite (christ, wine, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to consult a specialist to check whether a problem is caused, and that is the way.
We have said that it is a positive smile, so it will not be treated, if it is connected to another sleepstock that can be treated (e.g. with the sleep-apnoe or with the stress).
What you can do is to implement a series of simple preventive measures:
Do not try to get the child before sleeping.
So, look at a hard game for the child and avoid stressing television programs that are terrible and too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended repairs, repair methods can be used to help them get some internal rest.
This helps the child to sleep hardly.
When speaking in sleep once, try to keep the rest.
Remember that it is ungrateful for the child and the next day it will not be able to notify what is done.
Useful advice
Don't wake up.
This is unusual, because the child is inconscient, so you're going to get it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it's quiet.
Remember, if a couple of appearances have been disappointed, it is recommended to give advice or find out why the child has the reason for the child.
If they understand what it says (what is not so usually), the child does not press to perform a receipt and get more information.
So you will not be able to get anything in this way, because when the child sleeps, it is inconscient and can't think about it.
You will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, therefore they are careful with the interpretation of information and the keys you get out of it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even as a shit.
That's a lot of cause.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Out of house... End
After a long slow streak, Ill houses on the game field are finally on success.
Without great effort, the yellow shirts played a number of torching and made it possible to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The time of this meeting, at which the strict efforts to show their ability was not very high.
After a first attack of the guest Captain Buffmann, whose television shot was soon running at the angle, Illhouse houses would have to dominate the game with easily easily, and there was a changed first founderflyk with a telephone shot, then the brain with a high pass, and the Roman with a shot with the footsteps to demand the decline of Denmark.
The genetic community blocked in the middle of the field and left only the living Riahi on the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be determined by two torchs affected by Riahi and Temporale, and then with the first gate for the Illhouse by Marais, which was exactly right to take a ball back in a first trial of Diebold.
However, the ill-human Tors should not enjoy his happiness long and have been sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, so that his associated friends had to continue to play regularly.
However, Denmark knew not to use this, and a illusional eleven did not face a big problem that just moved a little back to defend them, except in the last seconds of the game, where the ball was very close to the late.
Sarkozy matches wounding fishers
Before he goes to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a breakfast in the Bretagne.
In view of the determined position of fishers who blocked the passengers to several brethren and normal hairs on Monday, the French president decided to enter on Thursday morning in the hall of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet their representatives there.
Lastly, they will receive him 'with a spirit', and hope that he comes with 'specific proposals'.
At the same time, the Chairman is located as a assembly of the Crisis Committee, which was found by the Bretonish fishers to implement measures in view of the extreme growth of the distillation price, which has reached a average value of over 1,14 euros per liter.
According to the Presse speaker of the Elysée Palace David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them in order to help their enterprises become competitive and to ensure the conditions of work and payment of the seaholders.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishers with desperateness.
Wednesday morning, they led protests in Morbihan and Calvados, causing the stone of almost ≥ kilometers of length.
Quiberon's sealhafe was also blocked, but the connections to Belle Islands were not disabled.
The Halbsinsel Quiberon has been dismissed with a lock.
Just on Monday, the mariners leave their deceptive expressions by burning them from early morning to roofs and palettes before the depots of brest and Lorient's hair, while they were holded in Concarneau or Saint-Brie.
The movement was based on other hairs of the Atlantic coast and the brain channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendea, where the fishing boats were not exported, or Le Havre, where approximately twenty boats blocked the manover of the trade chiefs.
The fishers of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique solved the blockage of the significant total raffination in Donges on the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting at the midweek in the Ministry before they decided on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions on the movement and its participation in the debate planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing in Paris.
But some British fishers do not want to be represented by the responsibility of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The streek will continue' because 'the fishers will not be sent to any point' and 'they will not go to Paris', for example, announced by Liliane Cariou, President of the Fishing Committee of Lorient.
The professional fishers who don't pay taxes cost the liter currently about 50 cents, but they believe that the rental limit of a boat can only be reached for less than 30 cent per liter.

AIG would take into account more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the United States International Group, which was financially supported by the chairman of the chairman of the Ethiopian, is to give more than 15% of its activity to replace the 85 billion billion which were preferred to him.
AIG is willing to carry out the sale of a major part of their business, their international life insurance and their age in the United States.
According to the FT, the Administrative Council of the AIG Sunday evening met to verify possible sales.
The AIG could not be performed.
The assets from which AIG might be separated, belong to its International Lease Financial Corp., their share of 59% in the back-secure transatlantic Holdings, and their immobility capacity and their investments in the Equity Equity, continued to explain the FT.
In relation to these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG must act as soon as the sales must be sold to pay the credits more than 85 billion who have allowed it to pay the federal reserves, also to the risk that the authorities receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost in the same way.

After the unexpected release of the plan for the salvation of the banks through the Deputy Room, which should allow some stability again on the markets, the Wall Street, which was already invited at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes, and 205 votes, the Members refused to reject the funds he had requested to the Secretary Henry Paulson.
Nearly two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
'This is a bad image that represents the congress as unable to take a plan', said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market has been counted on this plan', add it, and fears that a project will come too late in several days.
`If the project is actually condemned to the board..., it will be quickly the task of the Fed (the Eaglean Central Bank, Anm. Red.) and other central banks to obtain the crisis, which would be more restricted by the credit conditions', Brian Bethune, the Economy Boss of Global Insight.
And Mrs. Piegza pointed out that it was still higher than the feeling of extreme distress, that every day he extends the ruling of a financial company in the United States.
After Washington Mutual's concurrence on Friday, the Ananian authorities planned the acquisition of the banks of Wachovia through its competitive citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis was suddenly decreased and thus resulted in emergency measures for banks in the United Kingdom, in the countries of Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which indicated that the markets were not only confronted with a worldwide crisis, but also with the analysers of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic needs is strongly weakened.
The receipts of the State Case within Property years have been reduced from 3,632% to 3,827%, and the income within 30 years of yesterday by 4,161% to 4,357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first television dual
On the first debate of the two candidates for the White House from Friday, another followed to find out who comes out as a winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced to the election of both the Republican and the Democrats their own victory in this television dual, which should be followed by a third of the families of the Republic.
The political analyser David Gergen appreciates that John McCain's performance, despite the significant, was not  'brillant' enough to enable him to stop his return to the electoral issues five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, from which a review question was published on Saturday, followed by Obama with five points forward (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democracy clearly makes the best figure.
In the remaining unexpected electors, so those to whom it is now, Obama went out with 39% as winners from the question, while a CBS question says 25% of them as winners of McCain.
Obama should be expected on Thursday with the good work that Joseph Biden's companion in the first and only public debat with his Rivalin Sarah Palin, is expected.
`It would be a mistake to subvalue them.
She has instinct, but she warned this weekend Bill Clinton.
The seventy-year McCain did not stop rejecting his unconflictive experience in the area of external policies and clearly supporting the 'naivity' of his enemies regarding these issues which constituted the central point of this first television.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he stressed several times.
`I don't believe that Senator Obama is aware of the needed experience and the need to be president', he also assured it.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican elections since yesterday.
Obama himself pointed out that he represents the future.
He expressed himself quickly and precisely without leaving himself out of the replacement.
He insisted on his ability to make decisions and renew the picture that the world has from the United States.
`McCain has not yet understood that Obama is gone', but this week a democratic election in the Republican, which has been foreseen, has not taken into account the full measure of the crisis which is weakened on the 'Amer' street.
`In the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama claimed last night before 200,000 people who had approved a choice event in North Carolina in streaming rain.
He did not even recognize the words 'Mediumstand' or 'Arbeids'. 'The financial crisis produces Obama, which the Americans think the most appropriate to save the economy even at the border of the background, a clear advantage.
`The next week could be a decided turnpoint', appreciated the influenced democracy Senator Charles Schumer last night.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an earlier member of the Government of Clinton, compares the `good economic instinct' Obamas with Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidates, the current crisis is the conclusion of a eight-year bad economic policy that George Bush has implemented and supported by Senator McCain.
After he had remarked that he would even make it to reduce the taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the weaknesses in Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois showed that the creation of an energetical independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a disease insurance system, is the most priority for him.
However, McCain wanted to create an installation from 45 nuclear powers until 2030.
The two candidates take care of the issues on the plan for the salvation of the Finance over 700 billion euros (470 billion euros), which was discussed by the Congress yesterday evening and is extremely unbeliefed to the people.
Did you notice that a choice found in Minsk?
Young and oppositional demonstrated Sunday evening on the main place of the white-russian capital to reject the results of the votes.
Some hundred white roses gathered on Sunday evening since the elections were closed on the marketplace of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the Parliament's elections.
Although no result was announced, many youths came to demonstrate the power of Alexander Luchakenko: 'The Dictator must return'.
Some say that they have not chosen, "What does this benefit if they do with my voice what they want?" A young man says.
They do not believe that the regime shown to the foreign observers in the best light in order to restore negotiations with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-distribution of visa for 40 leaders of white-russian persons and the recovery of certain assets, could be rejected if these elections were considered cleanly by observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We have been excluded by the election Commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the calculation', a long-term Juri Potemkin, president of the Union of democratic powers, a closer combination of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the election of the presidential election 2006 and leaders of Pro-Europe's movement, because it is important to speak the votes, and this is the executive.
If the ladies of the opposition enter into Parliament, then because they were named, and not selected.
But their introduction to Parliament can mean the time of sending in television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is therefore responsibility to solve it into the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is strongly charged with Russia, is in a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are going to become a Protector of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition ensures that the organization for security and cooperation in Europe, who has followed the election, does not recognize the choice as valid.
It emphasizes that the election share payments appear too high and that the extension of the vote tax in front (26% of Minsk's electors) has introduced the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that a choice has been found?', the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Koowein, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year.
There was no one in the elections.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, even those who are in the first place of the Government's opinions.
The silence of the night is back over the October place.
In television, President Luchakenko and the members of the Central Election Commission are welcomed to their success.
Subdivision - From blood that was back safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th year of its creation, and her president, Dr. Francine Decary, had all reasons to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most safe and efficient blood banks in the world.
And, in particular, she has restored the confidence of the public, which was hardly affected by the scandale from the deceased blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross were ensured by HI-virus and hepatitis C-virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the unconsciousness of the public, the Government of Canada led in February 1994 a public investigation conducted by the judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to prepare directives to prevent such a new disaster.
Current judge Krever still refused to submit his report, then several provinces put a committee on the feet, whose goal was to develop a new system for the management of blood conservas in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were based in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and both territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec took their work, nearly 38% of people trusted in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Decary reported.
The situation was disappointing.
By enhancing the great efforts to improve the safety of blood conservas and by working in this area during the following years, we have returned the confidence of the public”, she says, before they proudly point out that the beginning of 2008 has nearly 94% of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Decary, however, has aware that `confiance is extremely disruptive'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of the prospect.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of many cases of the human form of rainwater in Europe, a new kind of creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told this woman, which has been guided since 1998.
And we didn't know whether this disease could be overtaken over the blood.
Thus, we call on one of the main guidelines of the reports of Craw and Gélineau, which, accordingly, applies exclusions if you do not know this and if a disease is only slowly progressing, as it is obviously in the case of the Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which leads to death unrepentantly.
Thus, in April 1999 there was no blood of people who have stopped more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt evidence that this illness will overflow blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of the prospect we used has a meaning.
In 1999, there appears a much more precise technique to recognize HIV: the Nuclear acid test (NST), which allows directly in the blood of the spider to prove the appearance of the virus himself, not the antibodies against the virus, as it was in the tests used before.
The NSTs enabled to reduce the incubation time between the time to which the person was invoked and when the first viruss could be proved in our blood techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that some speeds could be incarcerated without knowing it, and it could not be recognized, is essentially reduced.
These improvements allowed AIDS to decrease the risk of blood transfusion in significant way.
Today, one of 12 million people runs to receive HIV increasing blood.
`In other words, it means that 12 million blood conservations should be distributed before someone was signed with HIV.
Since Hema Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood conservations each year, it would be more than 24 years before a case occurs in which HIV was overcome over a blood conservation.
I think you can feel that today, if you get a blood transfusion or write to restore health, the Hema-Quebec Director's headquarters.
`Our challenge for the next years is to obtain the safety of our products.
You never know what illness is able to get into the system.
First in the past year, the Chikungunya virus has occurred on the island of Reunion, which, as the Westnil virus, will be overflowed by insects over blood.
We have to monitor uninterruptedly, Dr. Decary continues before it points out that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supply.
'The need grows because the population is old.
Since treatments for cancer control are aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood cells.
The overage of the population is also affected by the blood penetration, which is the average of 3% of the populations that are appropriate to the blood. '
All healthy persons who are 18 or older and are satisfied with the equation criteria, all 56 days, so six times a year, blood s.
In the average, 14% of those who provide their blood will not be accepted because they are diseased by AIDS or Malaria, for example, and whoever is traveled into a country in which Malaria is spread will be excluded from blood for a year.
With this 3%, we can receive an inventory that satisfies the needs of the hospitals.
Many suggestions are very rare.
But you need to renew the members of this spender network when they are older and no blood can be more s.
It is difficult to convince people of slinging blood, especially to keep them and bring them to become regular swingers.
Life today is so hectic that you often find the time to carry a hour in the bloodshot, and healing Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of 297 million € Hema-Quebec provides not only blood conservations but also human weights, including bones transplanted, heart clothing, hair and skin, which is almost used in serious burning disorders.
These weights will be investigated, bought and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public Nabel-snurr Bluebank Quebecs.
In the nabel snake, considered previously biomedical waste, there are rich blood cells that can serve to treat severe diseases such as leukemia.
`For a few weeks, we celebrated the installation of our thousands of Nabel blood tests, and we plan, each year, for more than a thousand.
'We should be able to start the next year by providing it for the transplant', explains Dr. Decary, which described this programme of Nabel snurblute as very beli.
Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it, because Hema-Quebec missed the funds to offer this complex and valuable program in all hospitals Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in halffinal
Montreals Impact last night, thanks to a 3 to 1-siges (4 to 3 with all the gates) against the sounders from Seattle in the second and decided game of the quarter final series in the Saputo station, where the total gate proportion was, for the half-final range of the exceptions games of the first line of the USL.
The Medium Field Player Antonio Ribeiro shot the resolving gate in the ninety-minute game.
After a first half time without the gate, both for the one and for the other side, the medium-field players David Texto and Rocco Plan ́no landed the other matches for the formation of Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Remember that at the first game of the forward and back game on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, the first Seattles had introduced a 2 to 1 download.
In the half final Impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
Saturday evening Thunders could compare a 3 to 1-depth in Minnesota by a 4 to 3-seek, but the Whitecaps → with a total number of ports from 5 to 4 yet in the half-final round.
Impact will be required to oppose Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
Shortly said - Vigstor by Kovalev
The number 1-Trio of the Canadian community is ready to take the season in attack.
Last night, the unit made by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn the attack on the Panther of Florida with a storm fire, which leaded to a 3 to 2-seek.
Costitsyn, the star of the meeting, shot a gate, Plekanec provided two models and Kovalev converted a pass in this triple, the fourth of the three colors in six preparation games.
Kovalev reached the victory by shooting the only gate of all the shooting.
I'm not still ready, the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel. '
`He fixed himself too much on the first half time, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a cruel attack. '
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not conclude or take election before the end of the year of election.
On the end of the assembly of the Liberal Parties, Jean Charest went last night to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (Li日) tried to be selected in today's sub-elect.
`The history of our last large border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented in the general assembly of the Liberal Partie Quebecs in Levis, where he followed the entire guidelines.
In his statement, a kind of image-made was projected behind him.
On three large screens, specular images of water power works, mountain works, Quebec viewed in `Google Maps', land maps, etc.
Great funds like during the election period.
On the contrary of the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would stop the elections of this herbst, even though he had determined that his calendar was very full.
The `Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'visition' which the Prime Minister has for Quebec, namely the 'new economic space' which provides an agreement with France on workforces, a convention between Canada and Europe and Ontario.
Although it was often mentioned in the talks of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th width - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, restricted to explain why the North is a 'youwel with a huge potential', but no date, no investment sums or exact priorities for the future projects.
At least some points on what more could be done: especially on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mountains industry, contributed by the growth of the countries of wildlife and the renewal of public infrastructure.
The record of Mr. Charests follows the North `Nickel, Zink, Copper, Platin, Gold, Silver, Iron, Titan and even diamonds'.
This Family is twice as large as France' is in our neighborhood, in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it's in us, he stressed how to clearly show that he is looking for a national basic dream.
Quebec was very wakened by its connection to the north, he noted: the street to gold in Abitibi, the tech of Quebec, the James-boat.
`It belongs to us, it's our future', he added after he had introduced a theatrical pause to look at the great card behind.
The North, 70% of the Quebec region, includes a part of Labrador with which the Quebec has already been invited, explained the Prime Minister of Press.
This is a traditional attitude that followed all governments.
There is a border line in which there is no agreement since a very long time, when the opportunity is offered, I will take this standing again in the name of the Government,” he explained.
'with the climate change, we need to consider our vision from the north,' he explained and spoke about the North West Passage, which will be able to carry out the whole year because of the iron.
In this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the inhabitants and the inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would take care of them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-pexicist lawyer of Hungava) have already launched consultations in about 30 communities.
A ministerial committee conducted by Benoit Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transport and Assessment) took place, has taken the works.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large congregation, not a gipfel, but a opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the North will remain in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North plan will be `proclaimed, regulated and environmental', he speaks.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the Liberal Prime Ministers before him.
`Come the Liberals who were before us, we have turned out to transform the challenges in new growth and development changings.
This was one of the subjects of the week again opened, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party at the feast of the 50th Jubilelje.
One of the decisions adopted intends to rename the power work of Beauharnois to Adelard-Godbout.
'On Godbout, who created the Hydro-Quebec, about reading, which reached the quiet revolution and the constitution of the water electricity, to Bourassa, who made James-But, always knew our party to determine the future', explained Jean Charest.
In contrast to the press, he took reference to another, this time, conservative reservation, and also on the `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Eastmain1a-Ruper Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest states that it was intended for 2012.
'This remains among us, but I'm supposed to be therein,' he trusted his members, which was made in those accidents.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that it would be 2008, and, of course, no election would be given in 2009, has in fact the possibility of keeping this herbst a choice that is possible for him from the law.
He notes that, however, his meeting calendar is full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a bullet between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly on Week made the Liberal Participant a platform from nationalist plans, especially from 'the Constitution', which was adopted without further: the PLQ is particularly requesting the recognition of the 'behavior' of Quebecs in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to call the members of the Council of Canadian and remote residence and that they are a veto in relation to the decisions in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were included with scepsia.
The Chef of the Partie Quebécois, Pauline Marois, has rebuild the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Government has introduced Landry 2001.
According to her Liberal Government, when she came to the power 2003, dismissed to apply it.
If she had done it, we would have already continued today, Ms. Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (which the choice is located today) France Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed the adoption of a North plan through the Government.
`But what we want is that this is not just a great imagination', the Participant Sebastien Proulx said in a representative for Mario Dumont, who comes from the vacation today.
Letters - A Country Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justiz's minister (which Irony) in the Cabinett Harper, was the last summer allowed to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'scande' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unfinished fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover such a shame, says as much about the people about the Prime Minister as Stephen Parker himself.
We have done this here with a government that has not taken home the countryman captured in the Concerning Lake Guantanamo.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was even a younger than did the things that would be predicted to him.
The only Government, who, despite the fact that Canada has undertaken the Gender Convention, has breached its word and allows a child soldier to move under unhuman conditions.
The only person who is in a parody of justice to appreciate the debt of the complaint.
We recall that, in particular, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian advocates are planning to get Omar Khadr home so that he may receive a righteous process in Canada.
This government also closes the eyes before the folter: It is little interested that a young adulter will be broken up forever after so many years.
We are not yet conscious of this, but we have just experienced here a worldwide circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, the harper is always bringing before it, and it sounds inevitably from the mouth.
So the time is coming when there is no more moral: a Canadian citizen is able to disturb, disturb and lock, completely according to the good ideas of a Governing Boss, which is only supported by the minority to this day (he may belong to a minority after 14 October...).
The electors believe to find their salvation at a party that preachs the discipline, law and order, but they do not see that this government has dismissed what has done the call and the dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Tuws, is in this disappointment, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The orwell talk of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This works, and follows a orwell logic that the world's largest gold winning society was a claim against six million against three authors and a small middle-lossing home, with the aim of opening a `public transparency debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and independent, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of deliveration, but in the law.
As it is expected, this fundamental subsequence was completely dismissed by Mr Garver.
For Barric Gold is the best way to lead a public debate to take everyone in the ruin that expects to represent one of their opposite opinions.
Like the process, the authors and the authors of the book Noir Canada will need to extract significant sums to prepare their defence and fight with very inequality weapons against an army of advocates paying from the almost unfair bills of goldmine.
The tactic in these inequality fights is often to destroy the defendants in order to strengthen a uniform regulation that makes the opposite tough and also fears everyone who expects to consider it again.
If Barric Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of things before the public opinion.
In contrast with what is in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold is walking and giving, the debates in Canada are usually issued by the exchange of ideas and not by the kitchen.
So it would have been gen if the Goldmine opened its books and acts and opened a real debate through the magazines, media, publications and the financing of independent tests that could have brought the light into this question.
But Barrick Gold seems not to have confidence in the public opinion and changes the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand move.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could ask for a public debate at the same time, but did he fail the opinions of this public?
This word appears to be included in the world of the Vice-President only the greatly paid advocates, not the community of all Canadians; a very fine view of the term.
In a democracy, the delegates themselves have the right to speak.
What Barric Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public supporting the authors and issuers of Noir Canada, is especially because it refuses the brutal standing of the goldmine.
This public is ready to hear and judge Barric, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many hold as Knebel Clay (in the history of the public debate), Barrick Gold just directed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they requested to not use this term anymore...).
Despite the surreal talk of Mr. Garver, the complaint of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth found basically for each democracy society.
It lying completely the right to quote credential sources and discuss the facts and interpretation that constitute the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to investigate and discuss the subjects that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barric Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead them by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to knows from a long time to get debates and unbalances in the face and to resolve conflicts.
The inproportional complaint of Barric Gold shows clearly that, in contrast to what she does, she does not enjoy a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the University World, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that threaten such unrighteous claims.
Rescue action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans are understanding
The Bush administration and the leading Congress Advocates, Republicans and Democrats have finally agreed on the largest economic salvation plan since the great depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan of over 700 billion US dollars to stop the financial crisis, which has supported the Wall Street for months, must be adopted by the two congress rooms.
The main contents are: a better control of the lawyers on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of the public money used, new provisions to cover the number of households covered by payments, as well as the right to monitor the holders paid to the leaders of the supported enterprises.
The Financial Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the Deputy Chamber Nancy Pelosi, and the representatives of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after the middle, the newness, after a second-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress in the direction of an agreement that will be effective', explained the representative of the Bush Government, Henry Paulson.
'All happened to sße the real economy and the population before the curriculum at the Wall Street', democracy explained.
'This is the fundamental point: If we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the injuries in the daily life of the Americans will be enormous,' explained the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been cleared during the last two hours, from fear of the effect that a renewable sheet would have made on the vote of investors.
The term that was agreed was the market expiration today tomorrow.
The two presidential candidates, which later participated in the negotiations, were more likely to serve the agreement, but not to refuse to express their incompatibleness that they should be taking them in this extreme way.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of certain provisions to agree, especially those who are to allow the owners to keep their homes and those who relate to the holders of the leading staff of the undertaking saved by the State.
`If you ask the tax payers to take exceptional measures due to the responsibility of certain persons, it is nothing that you may wish to succeed.
But these measures are necessary, he explained to the televisors.
When he was asked on another sender whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican enemy John McCain answered: 'I would like to know the details only, but I hope it.
`The guidelines I have led, show that this is a thing that we all have to endure, and with which we can go forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan is designed on the money of tax payers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, which has been issued by the place of an immobilious blaz, which has leaded to the combination of the riskable hypotechnical credits (subpresse) before it increased in further forms of broadcast investments (PCAAA), and sʹ in a refrigeration of the financial force and in the area of banks and money institutions.
A group of republian lawyers was that last week the first trial to agree.
Since the democrats have accepted that certain  giftige' assets of societies in difficulty are to be secure and not purchased by the government, it is believed that the gas is outside.
In order to distort the pointing angle for all of the Congress, you have also given a available information that if the Government had to lose this programme within five years, it would be able to raise new taxes in order to retain its capital.
The new plan provides the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can be reached to the 100 billion, if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of more 350 billion must be suspended in a renewed vote from the Congress.
In contrast, for his help, Washington receives shares to the supported enterprises that bring him in the case of winning dividends and that can re-over it when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of maintaining the payment procedures in relation to the apartments related to the immobility credits involved in this plan, and also fixing periods for the payment and refunds payable to the leading employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like that the Deputy Chamber already votes on it today, and then the Senate at the middle-week.
Despite all its efforts, it is still not sure that its plan will be obtained by green light.
In fact, more votes have been voted against this position yesterday, both of the Republicans and of the Democrats.
`Ganz obviously does not understand us', explained Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Financial Commission of the Camera, his electors.
`Yes, we have a great financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But not those in which it is to ask the tax payers for cash.
The Democratic Deputy Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the Congress, called 'the Kaukus of Skeptiker', makes the things different, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Fire hundred economic professors, including three Nobel prices, have written us to inform us: We ask the Congress to not be pressed, and to take care of what way to be put into place,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, we have received the evidence that this is a global crisis in Europe.
In an emergency assembly, the three Benelux countries announced the partial constitution of the Fortis Bank Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The Governments, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were needed after the French Bank BNP Paribas set out that it would want to pursue their competition, which is in great difficulties since it has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis through the riskless immobility credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and belongs to the twenty largest banks and the largest insurance.
'This is not a lost money, the Dutch Financial Minister Wo ́ Bos said yesterday.
In order to compensate, we have a choice and influence on the bank.
This is exactly what the guards and households appreciate, now that unsecure times are announced. '
On the other hand of the channel, the British Government was just going to constitute another bank in difficulty from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the Government would take all current credits at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, with over 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) from immobility credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander offered last night that she would buy the British Bank's accounts and customers.
Bradford and Bringley would have been the second bank that the British Government has to represent since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beautifulness with the blue eyes was a long time his tromp, no one would say his weakness.
Did the speech player free with the charmant lake from the Nazistic Spiegel?
Yeah and no.
His feelings, sensibleness, and a manifest talent have also kept him from a power that brings the real strange monster to the world.
But what a big dealer!
On Friday of 83 years of age, Paul Newman remains one of the last icons of the Chinese Chinese of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he liked, and for which he was a kind of rival on the league for a long time, more careful in view games, safely more disruptive, but also a apostle of freedom and the dramatic conventions.
Missed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From his raw roots, one of the strict faces of the Tra’anianian should appear.
Without excessive ego, the extreme quality character.
Because in him a whole country was reflected again in the fight that was destroyed in the Pacific War, who studied the beginning of the 50-years of showing game art in Yale and then visited the Actor's ́s in New York before he had success in the theater, in television and soon in the cinema.
Besides this man, who fighted civil rights, was also the leader who became in 1979 at the 24-hour round of Man's second, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a predicting relationship with the victory Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also, the unknown factors of this secretly, retaining, engaging and faceing the glorious showbusiness suspicious stars whose race never will be completely solved.
A responsible man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans, the Kinoliebhaber in Taumel this week, while on the dark screen of reminders, all his great roles were played.
More than a half centuries of film art in continuous changes goes with him.
Then the charmant cowboy returns from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) to memory, and the young man who returned his sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to the cat on the heavy Blechdach, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It will be called a much shorter repeated memory (1990) that will be raised to his sensible Mr Bri ́, which is in a high age of a wedding which has not fulfilled all its promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were in history.
This criminal, murderous, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a hand full of Dreck) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, was renamed after his death and the Newman made right.
This sympathic guinea in the surprising The Sting (Der Clou), which was exhausted in 1973 with the oskar for the best film.
As an amazing and famous Billard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This vision through the times, that was he.
He's still.
In lifetime, epochs are united.
The young man knows him especially from the cool movie Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox Tra ’ a eishockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen 1994.
With a last role in 2003 as a pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle was made.
On the contrary to several cinema members who have returned too early from the film world, Newman should stay in the sattel for a long time, while Hollywood, his powers, his prince and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Underplaying' when he assessed his powers.
The meter was not always easier for the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles flew so long.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as the outside side: Neuroticers, Alcoholics, Fieslings, or Dismissing, with which he reflected his reliefs and reliefs.
As a ruler, Newman enth’s unknown pages of his real famous sensitivity.
His wife Joanne Woodward, Rachel of 1968 (after the Roman of Canadian Margaret Laurence) and his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, was a fine woman's portrait full of Melancholia.
He, who lost his son Scott through a overdose, was his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of full enemies and triumph.
At the floor of honors that were on Newman Hoosss last night, Robert Redford explained his strong friend and former weapons associated with Robert Redford (they were played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) extremely: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Greatness and life pleasure were essential properties of the wounded player.
In addition to his legendary Karèe, there is also a great defense of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent Chinas, an enemy of Hollywood's explosion.
We have often seen him with the foot in shales full of vineyards, in sauce, bags, or other foods, and this is to be a little funny, although we were still funny at first.
However, the wines from its circuits were flooded into its establishment for children in need.
Instead of getting out on Mythos, Newman was involved until the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these seeds: 'Your father was unbelievingly thankful for his good stars.'
It was a honour to be here."
And for us it was a honour to follow the life of a so smart and magnifying age player.
An exampleal citizen, in the greatest and most important sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory & amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations in the penalty process against Janos supplication and its compliance.
In particular, the complaint will be made to participate in the organized crime, as well as crucial damage and business distortion, and other criminal acts, including false documents.
According to the State advocate, the eligible funds used for their own purposes, while the benefits were often identified with age accounts.
State money and payments by the self-administration - in total HUF 65 million - will participate in the Cases of the Fiatal Baloldal Organization, share in the cases of individuals.
As reported by the investigators, fixed accounts were submitted in the case of the payment payment, and the unions would not be complied with their obligations.
In the case of a complaint, a majority of the accounts should be added.
The accounting blocks were bought on the market by Jozsefváros, the signs were offered in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies should be issued the accounts was decided at the northern road of the Plattensee, which was sent to the István Lados of Janos.
In the motion of this "invitation tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He requested accounts on the consumption; to make accounts based on these proposals for the Youth and Sport Ministry, the Social and Work Ministry, as well as Budapest's self-administration.
These accounts are to be manipulated mostly by István Lados and 日 Complication, András 日ri, which should have been responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the targets of Lados' "invitation tour" was a beer-local.
As a result of two accounts issued in 2003 and Co, the Gastronomy Engineering would have performed the ninety-country group of Biztos Pont Egyesulet.
But now the leader of the operation indicates that such a large group would not have passed to the local.
Another account, issued in Summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövért Station, later as Együtt a Harmadik Evezedt, as well as graved form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which is only over three rooms and is not more than a person at the same time, 130 guests should have stopped.
The fantasy of the accounts was also not established as the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy operation in which the customers Jobb Jöv'ért and Hoppá's complaints were not only shown.
As the business leader Gy ·z · Farkas of hvg.hu notified, he was immediately clear that it was the case of older documents when he was submitted by the Governing Board during an application of documents.
"Our company name and tax numbers were mistakes on the stamp."
And further: Except for forms of errors, the fact was also wrong that the operation would have held a hundred persons after they had all 11 rooms that were unable to offer space to so many people.
It has also been indicated on the account of the complaint, whereas the aurant has not been operated since longer.
The embarrassed accounts have also been forced to check that the Budapest travel office, taken by them in the Visitor, offers a travel office for the outerland, and thus indicated Hungarian travels on the bar payment, which was also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As in the course of investigations, they also indicated the additional tax on the accounts, although travel offices relating to a country outside the EU are free.
The amount of the additional tax was totally four of the hotel Revøpløyp Kft. on the Jobb Jöv’ert Station, because the operation was calculated in place of 25 only 15% of MwSt., and the employees were also issued from machinery accounts, but the oldest documents were manually.
Another error occurred to the "reaching facilities" was that, in one case, they had indicated "water transport" as a performance provided, although this does not be offered by the specialized company on investment advice, the State manager shared it.
Other forms of errors - wrong account format, wrong stempel - was to thank the Egyut a Harmadik Evezredt Alapitvány, as well as the XXI. Šázadi culturalis Egyesuelt and Biztos Pont accounts were able to be inherited as false records.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Sport Lager Kunfeertó, whose business leaders had never issued the accounts.
Another "fouter" is the fascinator at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was just in the time (2001) that the group of the Fiatal Városert Egyesult had to eat there - the mass manager said that the accounts had not been issued themselves.
Conscious
The other group of accounting officers is persons who were conscious that they had to make fixed accounts.
On request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Efjú Szocialisták, the Sttiftung Esély Budapestert Alapitvány has issued accounts for the Együtt a Harmadik Evezedert, in a height of approximately 4 million HUF.
According to the complaint, the business leader of Collab Kft. was granted by one of the complaints, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fiktiv accounts.
The current biogate Kft also in Liquidation will have to be associated with adjunction and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH would provide Jobb Jöv ́ért Alapitvány, as well as the United Atlas Egyesület and Preösfeny Egyesulet with older accounts in the total value of HUF 5 million, which have been provided for for non-exported performances.
However, there was a little payment movement, since the accounts were directly charged after their exposure, however, what the employees had forgotten in their documents.
The accounting group includes persons directly associated with the complaints.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postboat of the Ucrainian business leader of Delta Trió Kft., one sitting in Budapest, but there is a non-findable train and vehicle trade form.
This company shall have issued several accounts on the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF in October to December 2005.
According to the investigator, the Cash Investment Kft has worked as buyers of these accounts since 14 September 2005 in Liquidation.
Business manager of this company was a Romanian who should also provide firm documents by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has made accounts in the name of the Albanian, at the United Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as the Egyut and Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány and has cast their own opposite.
Fa-Bani Jos Facpari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are to be founded by Roman wallers on Ivan Kubatov's express desire.
However, in fact, no of these companies was active, which was claimed to lack of mistakes.
However, he could benefit from the companies: on request of his compliance, the lawyer Zsolt scene, who was charged with the preparation of the establishment documents, he has made accounts on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with appeal, such as at Atlash and Y-generation.
In total, Kubatov 15 accounts have been issued to the organisations in behalf of the company Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linax Trade.
The State advocate describes that Kubatov could have cut 10% of the accounting amounts and the additional taxes.
Kubatov has even missed the Szi-Beri Bt. firm for the exhibition of more effective accounts - in this case the accounts were submitted to the requests of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-generation and Šövetség a Modern Magyarorzhágért issued their requests in the socialist party's useful organization, Ta ́sics Mihály Alapitvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints, however, these amounts have benefited from the rate-free.
To interfere with this, they presented the TMA five fitting accounts of the Works Team Kft.
These accounts were assessed in the Office of Arrd Kemecsei.
The negotiations are now calculated by some complaints with a consciousness of the procedure of the accounting failure as they have already been issued before the Government.
A sensation may be if the principal accused Janos's attachment to a comprehensive guest.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already been allowed many times to report completely about everything, his knowledge is still exposed.
The question, therefore, remains open if this is interested in whether the socialists have concluded an agreement with him regarding the recovery of the majority of the injured damage of 50 million HUF and whether it is ready to take the responsibility in contrast.
It is possible, however, that the adjunction is now playing the "professional" after his search for the mildness of the prison and household arrest was shot on baptism ears.
Other criminals, which have been increasingly greater damage with economic delegates and have not satisfied them, are on free foot, or at least under household arrest, have remained distorted.
The psychology of the transmission - or why we are ready to pay more
In increases, the purchasers are inclined to give more and therefore oversee the failure offer.
Neurologists and economic researchers of the University of New York are now learned to discover the neurological-economic bases of this and apparent irrational behaviour.
According to one of the "Science" magazines, people want to be in competition, such as an increase in eBay, and therefore are they ready to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to recognize the neurological scheme of this "spelle" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the others shared in a player action - in both cases the active brain regions of the probands through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants could win money, however, an increased A ° of the Striatum, a complex under the brain, in the losers of the auktions, in which the overcome of the enemy was a significant role.
Besides many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "subsidy" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that price increased by avoiding an overreaction of the striat.
In order to promote their teas, the economy in the research group have made adequate research on the following money.
In this case, three groups should be offered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was notified the real value of the product, then they made their units.
Another group was also charged for a recompense for the case they would come out of the game as winners.
The group received 15 > before the auktion, which were also lost in the case of a lost game.
Thus, the subsequence between both groups was only that the betoning at one on the winning, while the other was on loss.
As a evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "gegen to lose" group were prepared for units as those in the control or "viney" group.
"These results can be rejected by no previous economic theory.
These have, in fact, founded the behavior observed in the case of an auction only with the joy of winning or risk prevention.
The opposite between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the illustrative neurological procedure so that we have now prepared an appeal" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the Ar?
Over the world, about half billion people suffer under chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
However, the number of incourses is estimated for hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is that the patients often do not know that they are incerted.
Hepatitis is the term of sample for different viruses, infectious hepatic diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - hepatic hepatitis and gearing are often, but the hepatitis and diseases are different from each other.
The hepatitis viruss are extended to two different types: in hepatitis A and E through the hepatitis (e.g. by contaminated food or water) in hepatitis B, C and D may overflow the virus through blood and other body liquids (e.g. sperma, separate secret or speech).
Travelers are recommended to vaccine against virus A and B in any case, against virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are shown about two-three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally associated with inflammation, weakness, breach pain and breach.
Afterward, the green looking up on the skin and in the eyes, the throne will be light, the urin dark, and the healing can dure up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, approximately 1 million people in the hepatitis B, many more difficult diseases such as hepatitis and hepatitis.
The main reason is that rate is that only every injected in the medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious effects: untreated can lead to hepatitis and hepatic cancer.
Most of the infants do not even know about their illness, since the hepatic cells are homely destroyed - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
It is therefore unrequired for the time-time prevention, such as regular control studies.
There are three groups in which this disease is more often: those who have been subject to blood transfusion before 1991 depending on and tattooted.
Currently, the number of patients in chronic hepatitis C worldwide is estimated to 200 million.
Since the disease is already evident in a routinematic laboratory study, it is rare to visit the houser in the first characters of unknown origin.
Rightly recognised, the disease is healthy, the virus can be eliminated, thus called the infection conduct and prevention of the rise of cancer.
On 30 September, the world day of hepatitis was made for the first time of patients in the world.
The objective of the action is to strengthen the consciousness of this chronic hepatic hepatitis caused by virus, to strengthen their exhibition and the importance of the previous recognition.
Do the believers have less pain?
As recent research results show that religious faith acts like a kind of "smalls" that would have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Oxford’s students have conducted an interesting experiment: it was examined where the faith in God influenced the human smiley, reported the British sheet "Telegraph".
During the earlier bizarre study, 12 believers and atheists received electroscocks, while they studied a story of God’s mother.
As the results showed, the believers could disable the majority of pains.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be proved that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project, in which the near-projecters also shared philosophy and theologists from different university sections.
When trying, a functioning device was linked to the left hand, which the electroshocks were thrown out.
The participants were asked to conceive themselves strongly on two stories: to a picture of God's mother, designed by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other da Vincis "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the girlfriend Mary among those who believed would make a sort of religious trance, while they chose a picture from Vincis because it was shortly distinguished from the other mention and was found as a relief.
The testers ever spent a half hour in a MRI scanner, and at this time they received 20 electroscocks in four steps, while they should look at the religious, or the others.
The Catholics reported that they would have felt "in security" in the eyes of God's mother, as if they were "free" and they would have found "rush and peace".
With regard to the view of the religious community, they reported more than 12% less pain than if they had a work before their eyes.
Psychology Miguel Farias, who also shared in the temptation, thought that similar effects could also be made with other, strongly effective images also in the athletics, just to find the relevant photo.
"We have to find a picture that exhaustes very positive emotions like a mother or a father," as the psychology.
The English Bischof Tom Wright welcomed the results of research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases," it is Wright.
According to these excellent results, only the question of what effect a Madonna image would have or another comparable maler on the regulation of the believers' pain.
Would the high-quality girlfriend Mary have achieved better results?
You're what you're talking about.
In the case of their birth stages, Google can claim with flight and right: it is to find in the boxes of people as well as over their heads in heaven: she knows where people have delivered their vacation to which experts they go, and what they move.
And yet not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google business leaders.
In direction of Skeptikers, which are packed by Orwellschen horrorvisions, he allows him to adjust: These would just review the key of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google is to collect more personal data about the users and so closer to the original objective of the company, which it wants to organize "all information of this world".
Schmidt explained that Google was still a world changed work after age at the beginning of the information collection.
Questioned by the status Quo in five years mentioned Schmidt: He wanted Google to be able to ask questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What Job really matches me?", but software programs are not yet in the ability to know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are understood that the search terms would be registered by their Internet search, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the applicant to save its own search course and then return to it, so that the matches can be generated more precisely, and on the same logic, the "recommendations" are also based on which the system recommends reduced products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, the users ask themselves what happens in the case of a data misuse -- "When you see what I'm doing" -- some are concerned about the Google data monopol.
In most cases, however, it is better represented by the company, the potential power that makes the fear rejoicing, and less the school feeling or the case before punishing, striving to freedom or committing the power that is supported by many Internet users.
However, it is evident that the search terms are not only stored but also translated to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
An example of Paradise for this was recently the action against PédoIia in Brazil, in the course of its Google of the Brazilian Government, provided information collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the Implementation of the Pédo.
For personal rights concerned, however, the users were still able to breathe in May when Google with the Civil Rights Organization EFF faced the FBI: thus, Google can also be forced in the future with no point of constitution to provide information to the FBI on a secret request.
( However, the Federal Government has affected the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1.000 search terms in reference to the Juvenile Protection Law previously, however, the list of individual users, relatively their list of web and search terms, has been repeated in two months.)
Thus, Google's image remains restricted: Those who disturb their personal data because they protect the loss of their own and intimity by using the Google Services are the company with the conservative competition.
In the past, the "Geek-Culture", which is present in many countries, and covetous computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of "cool undertakers" in them, rather than Microsoft, thanks to Windows market leader, even if both are fighting the same goal.
A reason for this is that Google does not require his users to refuse employment codes, and provides his services free, so that a open, permanently updated source code and software package seems to be more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software gigant.
On the other hand, the Geeks is viewing the problems of personal rights and the Internet more charf - a relationship that is particularly taken in the past years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" in the meantime.
"Web 2.0" is, in fact, nothing but collaboration, talk to the users to leave tracks about and use the available communication channels, and even if the amounts are individually different, the main thing remains the same to be shown in public.
An average youth can also manage its profile - by Facebook over Xanga, this can be able to connect together through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can connect all of this into a follow-up system such as friendFeed or Blip.fm. They can also lead blogs that are automatically represented by the most recent photo gallerys that are placed on Flicr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples of cases shows: In view of the photos of the past night, the friend will soon find out with whom her unbelieving friend has enjoyed, or the employer will be released because he simply makes all too honestly in blogs. One is safe: The term "Private speech" has been completely interpreted in the meantime.
Whoever leads a online life is what he prices from himself - so you can form the fundamental idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever is trying to keep something secret, or try to handle the Google Monopol, can do it - such as Scroogle, a tool that allows Google search machines, however, no tracks left.
Not few people, obviously, register not on Community pages so that they are not found, but also the Google online →, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS Feeds, can be handled with alternative versions associated with no large server parks and thus do not generate the best possible profile by the user.
The public opinion expects instead to show its true view until Google shows its true view.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense are threatened by the income of the public agencies, and the more rapidly imported services provide not only Microsoft but also other software developers.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing opposite: So the concern guide has completely rejected a Protest of the employees after the duplication of the taxes of the company's child garden, and the management also considered that the multimediful office of the employees is too costly. But it must just be quite mild to the fact that Google went in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed with a agreement with which all regime critical meetings, or those who would be filtered against the good shame.
The internal scheme of the concern is that it is not going to perform a new service, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could re-force a few more powerful: In the case of some of Google's books and magazinescan or archiving projects, the company should soon be interacted with the Supreme Court Chapter, others are more distorted because of the "Health" system that allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors already provides the substance - approximately "Scroogled", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best orwellian manner, in which a man will be terrifyingly close to the data given by Google.
Two youths help the dual killer of ozd to eliminate tracks
In relation to the double murder of Ozd, the police has now asked two young people who are in detention to have helped to eliminate tracks, shared the speakers of the Police Commissioner Borsod on Thursday.
Young people were constant, now they are accused of the aid.
According to the MTI News Agency information, it is two girls who defend themselves on free foot.
Aid is threatened by a freedom penalty of up to five years.
The contemporary of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old orthodox man, was taken in investigation on Sunday.
The man is under an urgent deceit of killing a number of people from money.
In the course of the investigations, the 23th year of a 53th year had been charged with a greater amount of money.
However, the deceitful would not compare his debt, so he put his faithful man on a land in Ozd in the middle of the middle of the middle, where he killed him and his nine - year - old daughter.
According to MTI information, the man has planned the fact of long hand - that also proves that he has committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the Tatort.
As well as experts, the police now investigates the fact weapons and the circumstances of their use.
Warschauer Börse puts purchase boat for Prager Börse
EUR 200 million, or 5 billion Czech Crowns have offered the Warschauer bourses for the 100 percent purchase of the action packages of the Prager Bourses.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warschauer Börse, confirmed the boat that the Polands had put on despite the fact that they were earlier excluded from the Czech as possible owners of their bourses.
The reason is that the Warschauer bourses are totally belonging to the State.
99% of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State, which, however, wants to express more than 60% of the papers in the next months.
According to the Czech Daily Journal "E15", the Poland offers include the maximum purchase price ever offered for the Prager Bourses.
As reported in the magazine, the Wiener Börse, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Börse and the German Börse offers.
Petr Koblic, the leader of Prager Börse said last week that by all interesters the Warschauer Börse would be the worst new owners, and he also did not conclude that it could even lead to the closure of the Prager Börse in the future.
Market experts appreciate the value of the Prager Börse at 5-10 billion crones.
According to the Actionary Agreements, 90% of the actions could be increased.
The largest owner of the Prager Börse is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25-percent share, followed by the Cesca Sporitelna Bank with 14,7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13,5 Pro.
The financial crisis from the view of journals
In its comments on the international financial crisis that continued to continue, some leading letters have already spoken of "on 11 September" on Thursday.
The global financial catastrophe we had to thank the President of the Ananias, about the "La Republic" - the President had not even been able to make his own party for the legislative draft back to a person who should bring some lifting into the terrible situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion investor Warren Buffett named, it would be appropriate to speak of a "onceth September 11".
Parts of the pressure in Madrid also run the sinbock in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo" the violent political leader is due to the world economy now at the border of the confusion.
The financial system is always more binding, and it will suffer the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, but now after voting in the Congress, Washington has not prepared a political fund for crisis management.
The world economy depends on the air, just at a time, since one of the largest transformation of the capitalism history is located.
You can't leave the threat anymore except the eight, about the Gender 'Tages Indicator'.
Although some states could still provide money institutions in their choice, the banks would save the money of tax payers from the bankroot.
However, if a dominant effect is solved and there are more banks, there will be no further financial speech or other immediate measures.
The EU Member States should long-termly run over their shadows and centralize the control of the money markets.
Only on Monday, more than 100 billion euros were paid to weakening money institutions, the Wiener 'The Standard' notes, so the newspaper continues to be more realistic that the Americans now have to take something deeper in their bags to get out of the crisis.
The EU has not severely committed the crisis that now has been like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "Raster" should not be "wedden" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be rare to be set out in the case that it would be reasonable to cover the money of the tax payers in order to deal with a further greater damage.
Intelligentes Car imitates the flight of the hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the preventive sensors from nature?
For example, the birds.
The CEATEC in Japan was presented a wonderful project in which the Nissan Humels Ingéniors were inspired in the creation of new accidents of preventive systems.
In collaboration with the Tokioter University, Nissan built the biomimetic system of type BR23C, a mini-auto, equipped with the properties of the birds, with the aim of submitting the development of a system that prevents every collision.
In the flight, each bowl forms its own, oval "private" area, which is very similar to our own "schutzschild", Kazuhhiro Doi said, product manager for technology-PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The combined eye of the bones, which can see in each direction and in a angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in it.
To follow the function of the combined eye, the researchers adopted the idea of the laser taxed distance measurer.
This identifies barriers before BR23C in a 180 degrees view field within 2 metres, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to the board, which immediately initiates the collection preventive process.
The obstacle is registered in second breaks, and the author boot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bones, rotating the roofs around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to systems until now, this manöver finds pure instinct place.
"If it wasn't so, the author could not respond quickly enough to eliminate the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the copybooter project.
The system must respond instinctly and immediately, since this technology corresponds to the internal and vulnerable part of the protective source - a shift, which is still unevitable within the cases.
The whole process must reflect the beasts' behavior when they evacuate other bones.
And this must run in a second break.
However, it can only be two-dimensional, and only towards the importance of the roofs, the exhibition, in contrast to the beasts, not up, down, or a little diagonal.
Since the bones are infinitely open here, many opportunities to evacuate other bones, the researchers could only use the movement of the authorboater, relatively the disruption and abbreviation.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are easier and energy efficiencies, and thus have a longer lifetime than originating lithium ion battery.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinct, intellectual reaction, and less on the processing of data, and even less on the ability to save them.
This device must process only some inputs per seconds and respond accordingly to them.
It must not save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using the previous manover, so it will only take a handful KB Memo.
No Gigabyte and Megabyte hard memories need.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collection avoidance, which will be severely in production, after Nissan's assessment.
Another application could find the technology in the GPS satellite navigation, knowing that the car car is linked to barriers and leading it to the objective.
A name for the sync child
Now the written version of the 700-mrd-Dollar provides a severe safe packaging instrument, which will be applied in several stages, and aims on the acquisition of the bad credits of the banks.
In the first process, the help of the money will be issued.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after the Middle East Coast, the Congress Advocates, after multi-day debates, had made a consensus on the 700-My-Hard-Dollar, reported Re·s.
"We have achieved significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democracy president in the Democratic House of the Deputy House, and thought that the agreement should be made only to paper.
The achieved compromise on the salvation package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
The Financial Minister Henry Paulson mentioned the result: The programme will be effective and it will be able to do more, as Pelosi said, not to save the Wall Street, but to raise the ruder of the economy.
The written replacement of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so, Washington Time Sunday 8 hours (in the middle of Monday 2 hours tomorrow), but he has no height flight on the bars.
On Monday, the House of Deputy first agrees on the draft legislation for the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the senate is on the order.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress achieved in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and to smite our economy, said Tony Fratto, the white house speaker.
The programme, however, declines from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, which would be issued by 700 billion once for the acquisition, with credit credits.
In a first tranche, the half of the 700-Mi-Mi-My-Sarden amounts will be issued, with 250 billion once the Congress is expected to vote on Monday. This amount will be used for the acquisition of credit billion, bad value papers, and over 100 billion USD will be decided by the President.
The programme shall be reviewed by a own Commission, who also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other aid of 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the meaning of the Law, the Financial Ministry can also apply a combinated tactic: it can at the same time cover bad credits, hypotheches, and buy value papers with hypothecs, or other "toxic" credits.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the accommodation can be made both in an auction and directly.
The Law allows the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Financial Ministry guarantees the insurance funds, and the undertakings pay the respective taxes to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The Law defines the necessary funds so that to 700 billion can be provided as a immediate assistance for the financial system, it is for the large acquisition of bad resources, their insurance, or to avoid a system risk that is eliminated by the collaps of a larger money institution.
We set the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the Law as soon as it was signed, as Paulson.
However, the chiefs of the banks who are in difficulties and are now assigned to State assistance can be considered that their transfers, called "Golden Handshake" in the Oversee Slang, are decreased by the Government.
A shortage of the containers will only be given in certain cases, and these shortages will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each other.
The shortage means that if the Ministry comes into an auktion, the "Gold Handshake" is identified, unless the published bank head is cut into the pension.
In the case of a direct accommodation of false credits, the Government will be aggressively enabled to ensure that Managers will not be transferred.
It also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions are only related to new agreements so that more people will participate in the programme.
This is the first case in the historical history that shortcomings are regulated by Managers by law, the Democracy Barney Frank, president of the Financial Committee, commented on the action.
The State wins shared banks assets, so the risk for tax payers is too able to participate, unless the economy and the saved bank continues to be better.
The draft legislation provides that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years, how tax payers will return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, on both sides there were skeptics who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what the citizens of the Ananias expect from us, the plan does not make the money of the tax payers anyway, as the Californian Republic Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Captur, said that the measures were provided by the same persons who are also responsible for the Collaps of Wall Street.

No vision anymore in the United States since 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibilities that the Hungarian and Hungarian Visum Agreement will enter into force around the 12 June, as the Foreign Minister explained before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Your opinion "depends all now only from whether the electronic immigration-related control system is introduced in overseas at the same time."
But she also pointed out that there will be no travel authorisation in the new system, but the tourists had to register before.
The leader of the Hungarian diplomacy leads today to negotiations in Washington.
It is meeting with the Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, which will be transferred to the "Middle Verification Cruz with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and it also conducts conversations with the foreign policies of Democracy Barack Obama and the Republican presidential Kandidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain under banks save package
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the Great Party, have given their support on Sunday for the 700 billion billion. However, there are more effort to request the return of the Financial Minister.
The Congress and representatives of the Government have announced tomorrow after the Marathon meetings on Sunday that they have come to an agreement on the Bank Saving Package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the recovery of the injured credit, was addressed to the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better than the enemy to lead the country from the economic crisis.
Following the latest consultations, Obama could continue to build its predecessor thanks to the economic theme, while McCain's Hoch, which protected him the presentation of the Vice-Presidency candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, is at the same time mixed.
In a choice campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will accept the law over 700 billion.
He noted that the plan also includes the passports of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must act now, and even responsible... - your jobs, your spendings, your whole industry, and the stability of the whole economy will be threatened," he said before 35,000 viewers.
He did not disappoint McCain's economic visions as "obsolete".
In an interview given to ABC, McCain explained: "It is why we all will have hard to kitchen... but no support is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan would also provide the establishment of a control Commission for the Financial Ministry and the limitation of the deficiencies for the top manager - something that he had been on.
The CBS said Obama that McCain would not have played a definitive role in negotiations, but Obama was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the representative house, Nancy Pelosi, shared that the lawyer's house would probably be voted on Monday on the legislative project.
Presse view of the Dutch speaking Ra
The right store is intake, only the electors have become self-conscient within the store - so "The Spiegel" comments the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule in order to prevent a red-swarm coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic download of the CSU in article "Bayerns Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renamed politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the painful Beckstein-Huber-Duo took his owners.
The Christians have renewed Bayern for a year - now the modern citizens are just turning away from them.
At the same time, the epochen break is a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
It was not surprising that the disappointment of the CSU did not come, but on Sunday something ended, but it was already exactly a year ago: the uncertain hegemonia of a State party.
Since the CSU has landed at 47.7% ago since the fifty-pro-marks have fallen first since the fifty years.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundesday elections of 2005, so still in the many quoted stoiber era.
The consequent modernization of the CSU in the Federal Country has destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had projected this for 40 years ago, but in time they were very appreciated, but without effect, the SLU, the result of education, the transition of East and North Germans to the prospering regions of Bayern could not remain faithful to the CSU electors.
Modernization always matches optional improvement, and that has political impacts.
The right layer is intake - only the electors within the stock have become critical and self-employed.
In the last weeks, the classic citizen groups expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free accommodation, the professional citizenship and electors with Abitur as high school conclusion.
Here the support of the CSU was reduced by less than 40 Pro.
The press (depresse.com)
The Conservative Wiener quota reports in its "Who with whom? Participants who are in coalition issues" articles on the chaotic inner policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OPP.
The PSO is prohibiting the mixture of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ is open in all directions for talks, while the Green is still not wanted to be defined as regards a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about coalition; in the debates in public-local television, the parties have not seen their cards.
SPÖ-Cheef Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the OUVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very well possible - in some countries of the country and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question if he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current OUVP head as vice-concerner, has made Faymann open.
As he said, the electors would have chosen the shoes-Molter curse.
The repeat of this direction is not in question.
Molterer has reacted carefully on red boats.
The cooperation could not be fruitable, he thought, when Faymann tried to solve himself in the internal area of the OECD.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in coalition, is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed within the UVP.
BZÖ-Chefe Jörg Haider opened in all directions.
"To prevent red-swarm, we are ready to take government responsibility," said Hader.
Jaroka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be crossed
Today, in Paris, the European Gipfel has started to be equal to the opportunity of the EU presidential country of France today.
In its speaking to the Plenum, Livia Jaróka, Fidesz Deputy of the European Popular Party, especially the Education Segregation, as it is one of the most severe legal damage contrary to the children of Rome, is also the greatest obstacle to their exercise needs.
The high-range conference was opened by the French Ministry of Employment and Social Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Council Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Chance Equality.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, social partners, as well as the most important legal and citizen protection organisations in the field of equality of opportunities.
As reported by the EP ladies of Fidesz, Jaróka noted that, in addition to discrimination in the search of jobs, the Romans would first be distorted from their low level of education from work.
"The major majority of the Roma youths have no medium-school education, and thanks to a bad basic education, only a small part of them can get a high school conclusion."
Moreover, Jaroka stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which is a key role in the creation of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children can strengthen the economic of the EU Member States.
According to the Members, it is important that this conference becomes a larger circle - so Rome and non-Rome -.
Since a Roman student begins the school, as far as it increases his opportunities to become a productive member of the work; and by income and expenditure, they contributed to national expenditures.
"When citizens of the Union, the right to high-qualitative education must be guaranteed to Rome - the bad and secreted education must be established as Livia Jaróka.
As the lawyers explained, a common, objective and negotiating action of the European Union is necessary to facilitate the discrepancy process in the educational sector, which is unnecessary to comply with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the devil circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment, and give Roman children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a perfect citizen," Jaroka requested.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the rubfel has been committed annually to create a unique forum for the implementation of the objectives of the equality of opportunities and freedom of discrimination at a higher, but also a national level, in the meaning of the "European Year of Equality".
CSU: G日 at time
On the end of October, a decision is decided on the round of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein
Despite the election of the election, there are no heads to roll, at the top of the Bayer CSU, the personal debates were dealt with.
The Participant Erwin Huber and the Minister Beckstein remain in their issues, the question is just how long this Guideline is worth.
In the last week of October, the extraordinary party day will be decided on the shick of the dance after the 17-production loss of vote.
But the very shooted duo has already seen that it doesn't want to clothe on their seats.
This is what they want to approve the harmful group and the partial base, which requested a day after the "bayerian tsunami" because of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Five years ago - granted under the leadership of the Kareehouse point - Edmund Stoiber reached the Christian social Union 60.7 Pro. However, now, one year after the putch against stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4% of the votes.
The CSU was 46 years old "all-register" in Bayern, which exploded 18% of the German PIB.
Although the conservatives remain the determining force in the important country of Southern Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition futurely.
As the first sign of the parties' restructuring, the potential follower of Hubers, Vice-President and Minister for the Federal Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be included in the Statement Team with the Liberal FDP, relating to the legal "Free Electors" on a possible coalition of monkeys.
A irony of the shicksal is the same that with the list "Free Electors" the Gabriele Pauli enters the legislation, whose anti-stoiber appears first used the Huber-Beckstein Duo to deserve the goal streamless.
The CSU-führer can now raise all its powers on the stability of Becksteins.
In this transitional process, the stoiber, who has gone from the background to a active role. The former President and CSU president called "the best day of his political carrier".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments in the direction of the CDU - its view would have deserved the CSU much more support from the Sister Party.
Other CSU policies interpreted the download as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also has been very successful at the national level of 2005, is not replaced with a common power act on the feet, the labels may not be re-conceived after the federal day choices in September 2009.
Marks, which have not made any heal from their disturbance on Fiasko, believe that the CSU's territory loss will not affect the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is related is: the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of social democrats continues.
With 18,6 Pro ́, the SPD has reached its best result in Bayern since 1946.
Lucchenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no lawyer of opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament has made it.
Russian observers think that this is the welfare and stability of the country held by Alexander Lukechenko, the OECD, however, endorses the lawlessness of the votes.
The OECD sent 450 observers from 43 countries has not recognised the elections.
Although the legislation of the 10-million resident country has come out since years without opposition, however, the opposite of the United Democratic Powers (ODS) has severely hoped that Lukechenko, who would have been renewed in the unusual elections and, thanks to a constitutional amendment of 2006, has already been renewed to the fourth time, some Members of the opposition in Parliament would "to allow" this time.
Therefore, the ODS has even taken away from the previously planned boycotts.
The Ukraine is more economically dependent on the increased prices in the import of gas from Russia, and for the increase in price increases, the country has also taken credits to the exhibition of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gaspipeline that has been given to the Russian Russians. In the light of the expectations of the opposition, the hope that Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the European Union, since the Lukechenko and other high-democracy policy systems have been prohibited as antidemocracy.
For a temporary rest, the OECD elections evaluation report, in which the focus on the positive movements was higher than the deficiencies, such as the exemption of a third of the opposition candidates of the elections.
However, the OECD's report has already criticized the campaign on Monday - so the oppositional should not be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not to be present in the calculation of votes.
However, the opposition could recognize a improvement in the political system: Political prisoners were approximately placed on free foot, and Minsk is even to smaller confrontation with Moscow, while it continues to recognize the independence of the deteriorated Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abchasia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federative State, which has been considered independent from one month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backward, but the most important is that the dialogue between white Russia and the EU has started," Alexander Milinkewitski said to our sheet.
According to the 2006 presidential election candidates, a continuation is likely to be "the powerfuls have best received, even to leave a oppositional in Parliament".
The opposition does not make protest measures in view of the results, but trys to clear the need for economic reform to the electors.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the oppositional journals must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way during the destruction of stones, but I see that more people are going to change, even the elderly," Milinkewitsch said in the case that the most underlying scheme of pensionists is not even agreed with the Lukechenko regime, whose only service is the production of social security.
"Thank the debt of the country and the growth of the trade debt is only a question of the time until the "social security" in the peace of a peacehouse begins to breach," so Milinkewitsch.
In contrast to opposition policies, Russian observers have taken the elections as democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, leader of the Community Independent States, explained by the News Agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the works and not the words." The failure of opposition is thus a evidence of the rape of the white-russian electors.
Brunetta: "From now, it's too close to the work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotable doors for the income and outcome of the officers.
Since this day, the measure will enter into force against those strike-ups, which are first stumping and then going to drink coffee during the working time.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz-Legit" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and by Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Ministerial Council.
">"Treeable doors are a means to increase the workshop through a range of presence rates and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new time of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," stressed Brunetta again.
The Palazzo Chigi ends the establishment in all buildings of the Presidency of the Ministerial Council.
Masi says, "the choice of the roundable doors is also of a great symbolic value."
The Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by everyone, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, therefore, there is no breakfast more during the worktime; closs with coffee or croissant .
Brunettas discusses this regard with a laughing: "A good cappu ́no acts wonderful at 7 hours."
A meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Public Administration)
by Rome the Minister declares that "in the midst of three months the residences of the employees have been reduced to 50%, which means 60,000 people per year in the work."
In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"the loan dynamics - so the Minister - were doubled in the last 8-10 years as large as the area and far above the inflation rates."
In the meantime, thousands of employees have joined the Brunetta Decree in the framework of the vocation supported by Codacons.
"When the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers of less deficiencies in the work - the consumer center - whilst the people of the "active fools" are interrupted.
In fact, thousands of right and valuable officers of the public service have joined themselves to declare the contrary standards of the Decree the war."
In the case of the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) for adequate financial compensation for work-related illness, the planned extension of the obligational household of the lying employer, whereas control visits can be made and further aspects of the renewal of the Minister.
Napolitano: "Appeal against accidents is decisive"
Each day, 2500 work accidents occurred in Italy, three persons died and 27 remained invalid.
For the year 2007, the data of Inail (Istituto na > contra gli infortuni sul work) were visited that the death accidents were located at about 1200.
These figures indicate the seriousness of a phenomenon, which almost doubles so many death cases that occur by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Association Na≤ Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will be held in all Italy's provinces on the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents to link the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The concernful, broadcast data and the tragical messages of these days visit the issue of the Prevention on the workplace," says the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in its communication to the President of Amil (Association na日 mutilati et invalidi del work) Pietro Mercande .
The Governing Boss expresses its "creasing value for the constant commitment to prevention of workplaces, protection of damaged workers, assistance for victims' families and sensibilization of public opinion".
"An emphasised "Basta" has raised up on it, understanding in tragedies that, in their size order, solve some wire in the media and share of the public, but the daily reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamic."
Napolitano does not deny that "is also a resource problem: it must be determined to be invested in education and information."
It is particularly important to accept the number of initiatives for a more direct consciousness in school frameworks from young people who are near the work world.
It is our obligation to determine the attention to this phenomenon and not to decline from social seriousness. It is necessary to enable and improve a legal standard.
The President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini, on the other hand, stated: "How the phenomenon of the death conditions of work is a thirty-social emergency, which makes the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on determined rules that have the goal to end the problem."
"The data of work accidents seem to be a light improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of deaths related to work is too high," says the President Anmil, Pietro Mercanda.
"We don't want this "eventive tendance" to mean less attention, just that causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you think that you are too small to face the phonomy of the accidents, but you can fight by various actions.
Increasing controls and inspections are necessary to our opinion – so Mercanda; but also stronger measures to enhance the workers who have already started in school.”
"And another effort is needed - so he puts it up - as regards the communication and sensibilization of the public opinion.
But, in particular, a greater responsible feeling of the employees' sides of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Moreover, Mercanda faced the "progressive deterioration of the protection of the accidents of the victims" and claimed "the decrease of the social system that we have been fighting in the last years".
"The objective is, therefore, to return a guarantee to the employer so that the sale of the victim of an accident of work does not depend on voluntary or accidental S., decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player under accusation:
A sound music for a longer time with trackable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent audiences.
This reports the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Csseri (the Scientific Committee on the current and recent health risks) of the EU today in Brussels.
"After the report, this means in a comment, 5-10 per cent of those who hear music with tragic music devices for at least five years a week longer than one hour a day, risk the permanent loss of their audience."
"I'm worried that such a large number of youths who usually put musical and phones on a high volume, without knowing that they are inevitable," says Meglena Kuneva.
"After the scientific finding – that is since the Eu – it is a clear risk that has a rapid action.
What it really means is to make consumers ́s and to make these information about the community.
In view of these scientific knowledge, we need to check the existing control systems again so that they are completely effective and keep steps with the new technology."
Brussel had assigned the independent scientific committee to the spread use of the tractable musical devices among youths.
"The European Union's communication concludes that you are too concerned and that the Commission will now examine the necessary measures for children and youths to be better able to switch out of trailable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a standard that limits the level of the warmth of tractable music devices to 100 dB. The care of the damage that could come from a too large sound load.
These damage can be very limited, in which solutions such as reduction of volume and length of audiovisual settlement are taken.
In its report, the Scientific Committee shows you that if users of tractable music devices only listen to the week (la > 89 decibel) music to be overcome by the legal limits that apply to the maximum sound weight at the workplace.
Those who cross this limit risk the total loss of audience within five years.
This is therefore about 5-10% of the users of the devices that can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in which you can evaluate.
Rome, Germany gives the starting Board to the "Commission for the Future of the Major City"
We begin today, in the market, it will be done in June.
This is the end set out by the Chapter for the works of the "Commission for the Future of the Major City of Rome". This morning the Commission met the new sitting behind the Caracalla terms today.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the town and the community will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official Stempel" of the Chapter and the Master of Oberst-Bassed Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in her," says Alemanno. "They will present proposals for a development plan for Rome that remains political responsible for the city and the community.
There is no new distribution of responsibility, but only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed, and the Commission will re-resolve, since such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June - so the Master of Oberburg - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work made by the Commission."
Who asks the Commission's competence, because their opinion of obligation is missing, it calls Alemanno: "All depends on the work that the Commission will issue and the quality of its proposals.
If it, as in France, provides the Attali Commission qualitative results, and this will certainly be in Rome the case, then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often the employment is involved with the daily problems and challenges that occur from time to time.
However, we want to have a longer period of time to work with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The top citizen of Rome is very valuable to precise the following: "This Commission is not a useless institution or a wrack: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens, and it will bring us to mind, and it will take the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "the strategic plan is needed, which is neither hermetical nor statistical, to enable our city a quality speech - which it really needs - and to make a common step in the future."
A future, such as the Master of Rome, "not only in the current communal limits, but also in many ways," not only regarding the role of Rome as the Metropole and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a claim
A cluster's ananic, which is much to be considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama is the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who was decimed by his decisions, the United States economy, and that was the association with the beloved Islam (and this is still doing as a man)."
The attacks against Obama will always be more hostile, just now where the choices are near.
A Lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very frequent: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation who has seen two black gubernators and five black senators."
In fact, these attacks do not have much to say; it is racial attacks, and they do not answer the question of the electors: will he be a good president? And then there are also questions; everyone says that Obama will be won with a great prospect.
In this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A magazine from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in the editorial: only in the election cabine we will know who the real patriot will give his voice.
Here is a mentality of the United States, which has been hidden until late.
"Tell what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our cryking, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we're going to emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before is just now where the success of the Black Candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these reviews, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What errors did Bush come during his office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America changes.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a trip inside.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to packaging.
However, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weak point.
He who will take his position is before a great task.
USA. The financial confusion also leaves his tracks in journalists: In the magazines you can see the shortcomings. And many accuses the Internet, the "kill" of the print press.
Five hundred journalists were asked about the future of the Research Centre on their situation and their mental control.
Today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they explained the information about competent authorities that are not really concerned about the general credibility.
You don't feel so alone as before.
The problem for the journalists is the money.
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis of a economic model that has been decreased for these journalists.
In addition, the biggest problems come through the shorts of the news room, so the room in which the editors work to set up the journal.
It is a problem that must be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to avoid that the traditional journalism, as the large public understands it, is not significantly abusing.
A clear, but complicated Piblemissus fulfils today the journalist of the Ananias.
Six journalists and executive seniors of the pressure are thinking that the journalism is on national level on the wrong way.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed by Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine where the web is going.
The most important groups of pressure groups build the way to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "killer" of the pressure.
The "economic pressure", which the journalists are looking for is to reach up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to join the new technology in the hope " they bring something good for the journalism".
The greatest rise is today in the journalism of the newsroom's leaders and reporters who work for them.
56% of the leadership at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it's to do with the "security in the work".
The operating leaders who have lost their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "redactory", Anm. d. Red.) is always a current subject in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under the Treaty.
In a large nation, such as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of magazines, magazines, radio and television senders and internet operators, the employees offer as they believe and then a question of take it or leave it.
The Chef-freedactors often receive very high salaries, however, the editor can receive only 10000 euros per month, in order to pay pensions and insurance payments.
As regards the vacation, the thing is complicated: a certain quantity of days in the first year, so and so many after the time to get sâ after a certain number of 15 years of vacation.
But the journalists, as they give themselves, will often be "known".
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The Chairman of the Second Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the Immobiliary Macher, which had requested to be sent by Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola because of the bankrot under the investigation on the contravention agreement in the case of the adoption of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the household was converted into a maintenance obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had requested to allow the immobilious machine to be sent from the town of the province to a apartment in the capital.
According to the Court of Justice, such provisions (which the Government had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to reach his accusing evidence material.
The Elite is inside
The phenomenon had been opened a few days ago when the Deputy room against the 700 billion dollars spare package of the White House was: a large part of the Americans and is more interested in punishing the Wall Street than to save the economy.
This is the tragic issue of New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the Republican Party is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always benefits the state institutions and business and those new-conservatives, "the in Washington" and the financial world, and, in the South and the center of the States Electors.
This part of the Partie thanks to the vote of the vote I had approved above.
This very important example is only a small part of the large changes announced or even presented by the current economic landscape: not only in the United States, even in the west, and may be affected by these.
As far as in states and in Europe, the crisis seems to clear the long-term events which endly adopted and come into light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomenon is the new discovery, the unhearted renaissance of the State in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decrease of banking and financial institutions, which deep connections to foreigners and also manage an unfair quantity of the capacity of households residing in one country.
This means a direct political problem for the governments: how to behave with the relatives concerned, which also represent a huge choice mass.
Therefore, the crisis appears globally economically, but politically, however, it is almost clean national.
The political internationalism seems likely to be aware and has lost its speaking right: The clear evidence of this has been given by the EU, which is not a common way to find a single way due to its division in different national and international conflicts.
Therefore, everyone considers the involvement of its own state; salvation plans, new rules, etc.: since the crisis has become more serious, only the United States are to save themselves in the economic situation without foreign assistance.
In addition to the media, they also use this legislation: therefore, two non-revaluable conditions, in certain circumstances, which will not be able to take away any international organisation or market in the same way.
This new pressure, which is placed on the State-national element, is, in the rest of the perfectly in accordance with the most significant significance of the latest economic associated sector: the territoriality.
Paradoxer way is just now, when we were so convinced that we were so long to be in a connected total rich, in a kingdom of always different technology, of the immaterial, that we must find once how our future will be more dependent on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although all of them can be transported from one place to the other world, they are still connected to an extremely broken part of the earth — a territory.
Therefore, the one who is over such a territory is in favour of another who is in a free area of oilless, waterless or free of oil.
I'm now coming to the second news, but I'm supposed to have a short intervention.
Whoever is the territory, who is the government, who says, it also says Leadership.
In this regard, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomenon.
On the other hand, there is the need for leaderships, so the need for someone who knows how to arrange things.
On the other hand, there is now a wallet of destruction over the existing leaders, namely those of the economy who have become inappropriate and full of shadow zones.
In addition, there is a deeper and in a certain sense more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an indulgency, an image of insufficiency, a feeling of the remote, which is generally addressed to a whole class of Managers of the Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large parts of the population is to build the way that it is not only the facts of the social elite, but already their ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the most significant sense of the word, whose content of the majority is as always stranger and overcome.
The request for Leadership is therefore underground, but strongly moved by the design of the leading class and the original political establishments. This is demonstrated in the unpredicted "revolts" of the electors and in the unexpected conversion of the colleative state of the last time: starting with the growth of the conservatives in Austria and Bayern, over the combination of the Labor party in the United Kingdom, to the rebellion of the Italian Deputy against Bush (and may also play a role in the victory of the rights in Italy here).
The impression of the old elite, its parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, more understanding problems and therefore less representative values about what is currently in the lower social shields of the West and is still strengthened by the financial crisis, and it is done to the overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would be hard to talk about a "rebellion of the mass".
But keeping the eyes far open is certainly not.
The super-clipper that lets the walls go up
The powers of gravity thanks to a clothing and to able walls to stick like Superman.
This is the subject of four-year research, which now seems to be almost attached to the goal.
The researchers have learned to fix a 100 kg severe body on a vertical wall with only 2.5 qcm.
The STUDIO – a `ananian magazine, has made the results of the researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material discovered by the research team is a further development of the already used breeding, which is a specific carbon structure, called carbon nanories.
"The Prince of the Cleber can be imagined as a series of ordained rows in Spaghetti," Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The creatures have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, covered by microscopic herds who give the animal a perfect stand.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sleep paper have shown that the new cler is often stronger than the maintenance of the feet of the reptilies and the same way "leaves unfortunately from the wall", so Liming Dai, researchers of the University of Engineer Scientists of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transfusional coal," Liming Dai adds.
Something like Spiderman's attachment to walls? Maybe, but the researchers think about a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the Nanor's kitchens are also leaders of warmness and electricity.
Other application areas may fall in the area of the road.
The superheaders must wait for the moment.
Other ARTICLE OF THE PERSON — including the University of Berkeley, California, is a new class.
In a article of the American Chemical Society, the California creators present a cloud from microfashers who purify themselves as a hair by moving on a surface themselves from the powder and thus keep a perfect detention.
Medicinal medicines: Never take with fresh salt
Preview of grapefruit, orange and appeal saft.
These trees, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitaminity in the summer, may result in serious health damage when they are taken with certain life-wide medicines, as they can affect the recovery of this body in extreme way.
David Bailey, Professor of Western Ontario in London, shows again the risk of packaging and fresh fruits in relation to medication input. In the framework of 236. meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelia, he shook again alarm: It is gen ́a glass apfel, or orange or grapefruit safe to reduce the capability of certain vitalized medicines so much that these are practically eliminated and so the health of the patients is eligible.
Grapefruit safe was already determined to be responsible for increase the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthPropertya, heart cyclic medicines, anxiolytics and neurological medicines until toxic levels.
MEDIKAMENTE IN GEFAHR – The same medicine Agency had warned in a report two years ago doctors and patients before the mixture of this mixture, and stressed to take care of what will be drinked in relation to medicines such as diazepan or metadon.
IS NOT OF GRAPEFRUIT – The experts also contain oral samples and appeal samples that the medicinal products can hide.
The list of active substances contained by the plants is long.
Therefore, the Challenge of Michele Carruba, director of the University Statale di Milano: "These results are usually transmitted immediately to the various international producers who are so pleased to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to read the package packaging and, if there are uncertainties, not to ask for a apotheker or Ar, “the expert of the Ansa Agency.
The economic nobel price is to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for its analysis of trade patterns and the economic activities.
The 55-year old Krugman is a neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the economic and external policy of the Bush Administration.
A few months after the requests of 11 September 2001, during the day of the Enron Collection Bruch, Krugman said in a New York Times leadership that this second event was decided for the story of the United States than the Attentate.
A predict that has not received polyemics as a response and has been held to the economy for years later, but today is being completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked about how quick the memory of the scandale has been disappeared from the public field," Krugman said end 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economy of big value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style that is especially against the excevable Liberalism of Bush Government".
Open Office, it appears the version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software is wined as free replacement for Microsofts Office, a number of users, both home and in the Office, both among freedoms and public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers monitored by SUN microsystems, the new Open Office is now present with some news to the public: along with a super-score and now designed start menu, one is now finally achieved by a guaranteed compatibility with the Apples Operation System Mac OS x, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) format, so the latest ISO version, given.
Eight contrasts were also able to read the compatible with Microsofts Office 2007, which new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) by OpenOffice.
Interessant are also some new features, including those who allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, such as easier sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files in graphics processing modules and to maintain the original appearance of the page.
This is how "hybride" PDF files can be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format about the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be included many hands of different users, preventing conflicts in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor will be assigned a fraction to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just in the way to publish different functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be published in the next weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version that is on the mirrors since Friday.
Furthermore, for Windows and Mac OS, the program is available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to home or to the office.
If the freedom of costs is an incentive to spread the program in the households, it is also in the area of business where OpenOffice could take place the big holiday: s^ have already passed different institutions of public administration and schools to OpenOffice.
In fact, it does not even miss a training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus also open business perspectives.
OpenOffice is combined from five main components: writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program aimed at excel deterioration; Impress, to create a representative as with Powerpoint; Dbase for the operation of databases instead of more access; and later ́ Draw, a graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can also easily exceed 3 million and 600 thousand.
Included coal positively tested and thus the fourth case of deficiency
It opens a new case mi frame of the past Tour de France: it's the Austrian sporter Bernhard Kohl of Gerolsteiner team, which is the third classier and winner of the best clerker tricot.
The message published the journal L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year cold of Gerolsteiner's team is the fourth driver, which has been tested positively on Cera, the Epo of the Generation. This has already occurred in the Italian Riccardo Riccó and 日o Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis from the blood tests belongs to those who have been performed in the last weeks of the Labor Losanna and Chatenay-Mala.
If you act with the tests now the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its place and be excluded from the rounds for two years.
The chief of the French Antido committee Pierre Bordry was the positive epotest, and reported by the Press also the Austrian competences.
The 26-year Austrian, behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, went to the podium and also advised the tricot of the best clatter for himself.
TEMA INVISION: THE NYYORK TIMES APPROVED: ITALIAN RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the only country of immigrants has become one of the preferred countries for immigrants since recently," which are only taken into account with opposition.
Does this from the Belpaese a nation of rassists? This asks the New York Times in a long article, which has been divided to the whole theme of the rassism in Italy and from the case of the young man, from Burkina Faso, is the right Abdul William Guibre, who was killed a month ago in Mayland after he had closed a packaging Kekse.
The case refers to what the Times are "Paradox of the North": the North regions are those in which "the majority of integration and working opportunities" and "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sensations and the greatest support of the North Lega".
As a result of the growing spending between Italians and immigrants, the times are based on other episodes of intolerance from Miland, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration and the rapider exposure of illegal immigrants is also indicated as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which also supports the father and the state president, "Giorgio Napolitano asked the dad at a meeting on the kirinal to cooperate between the church and the State to cope with the racism."
Studenttimes of up to 900 euros per room
The apartment market doesn't know any crisis.
According to the last study of Sunia, the municipality, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Mayland, 700 in Florence, 650 in Neapel and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious moves. Many people lose their rights, because their families are not able to submit them to this height" – so the responsible of Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities leads the great request from the students to a deformation of the market, which has also threatened the other inhabitants.
Furthermore, the majority of the offers include a number of crimes: free contracts, failing registrations, without the price limit, unleased submissions.
For the Sunia, the need for exceptional measures resulting in the reexamination of taxation is the need for lower payment prices.
In a more precise consideration of the investigation, there is a need for a slaughter in Mayland in the fourth Brianza, approximately 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the fourth band of Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the fourth Lambiate, Udine and Fiera, or at least 900 euros in Vittoria.
In Florenz, a average sleepplace costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students are concurrent in the fourths around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters are around the United Nations at approximately 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleepplace in a double room.
Just a little deeper are the meetings in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecità.
Only those in outside areas can save money: 300 euros for a sleepplace and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Neapel, 300-450 euros are needed for a sleepplace, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the highest quarters, the polyclinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleepplace costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest towns, prices are lower, but they have a larger weight in the state industry.
In the cities where the phonomy of the missing of other students, such as Perugia, is often more frequently, there is even another anomalie: a middle that is about 25-30% over the average is required by foreign students.
Congratulations to the old Kino Paradiso – the cities close their historical Chinese sales
The historical kinos close because of the beneficial multiplexkinos.
"A city without Chinese sales is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the Governor Giuseppe Tornador describes with effect what happens in the large city centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the Kinos, which began with the birth of the big multi-sal complexs in the periphery, long-term means the death for the unsalkino in the center. A process that appears not only inappropriate and inappropriate, but also the move of a cultural crime.
The most historical places are full of memories, "is to lose a friend with which you have returned a lot of streets of emotions," thus the director of the film "New Cinema Paradiso", which has introduced him 20 years ago the Okar and the great price of Cannes. It is the story of a president kinos and its nostalgia, which is from it, to live in a quietly lost kinowelt.
The numbers that the Anec provides the central warehouse band speak a clear language: In the last five years, the number of 316 traditional Chineses must have been closed; these tens paid to the largest part of the Chinese in the largest cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Malaysia, Neapel, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions belong to Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost kinos, followed by Toskana with 44 and Lombardei with 41.
This shows that the major faults are the Multiplexkinos, because there are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern Kinos has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years the Lombardei is listed, 81 are both in Toscana and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in a irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "is useful to produce new structures, but at the first place, the maintenance of the already existing, because a room in the city is closed, not all its staff minutes are ready to visit a multiplexkino in the periphery instead of the old.
And there is still the deficiencies for the fund of the warehouses: the charge of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame of ethical moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of need."
Interessant is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided to spend them through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement in Italy, which aims to sämre and subscribe the traditional Chineses, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
In the preliminary measures, tax advances for the cinema operators and the public benefits in relation to trafficking are also allowed to run into the limited areas of the centre and to park more favourable parking.
"It's a pleasant initiative," so Giuseppe Tornador, "I hope that other cities will be joined to our example and develop new concepts.
But, of course, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to fix something against the super power of the multiplex sales, because s ́ the public of today is more attractive.
The defense of the traditional Kinos has always been an important subject for me: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the exhaustive point that helped me to consider "New cinema Paradiso" even though I had played with the thought since 10 years.
Since 25 years I live in Rome; if I go to Rialto or Quirinale in Via Na≤, where I have learned so many different emotions, I turn to the side to not have to see the plastic places covered.
The connections between and Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the citizen master of Gioia Tauro
"The citizen master of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia Group Piroma.
The accusations of the advocate of the Anti-Mafia Chalabrians against the citizen Master Giorgio Dal Torrione and his representative Rosario Schiavone of the community Gioia Tauro, which were arrested today in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piroma, the older intermittent between the government and the public administration, was also taken in hands: the lawyer, who has the same name as the boss of the ́ns, has already been condemned for crime associations of Mafia, at the same time to an estimated sum of 10 million euros.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard misunderstanding," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations have decided to pay to the advocate Piroma's money for consultation activities."
"Somit was made possible by the Mafia Group – so the judge – to enter the Council on a official way and to agree with the public administration."
The Chairman of the Regional Committee of Kalabrians Agazio Loiero does not claim that there is "all other than one exception in his region to join connections with local administrations and organised crimes." "There are places where the concurrence of Mafia is greater than in other countries in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of Ndrangheta: heirs who receive a white western."
The arrests of this morning follow those of the last July, with which the police of the Piroma's was devoted.
Since the end of April, the assembly of Gioia Tauro has been resolved, but since 1991, and at the same time because of the associations between organized crime and local administration, the local members of their communities have been rejected.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the citizen of the Udc, was then selected to the head of the Mediterranean Coalition after the election of May 2006.
He cried as the prefecture organized the resolution of the Community.
He was interested in the Vice-Minist of Marco Min, which he intended to have found everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges claimed that the Piroma-Clan had even expected to make an amendment to the A3 project.
From a derogation related to the investigations in the case of Dal Torrione, the ready to meet the desires of an undertaking, which is, in turn, a representative of the large group about the Piroma, which has been the same as the measures of public administration with the interests of this ́s."
When the energy comes out of the walls, the big ones suddenly run up
It's a non-successful source of money covering over 70% of the surface of the planet and just now it seems to be understood by the great energy forces of the world.
Wells, streams and times are the new renewable energy sources that are now looking at all, and also looking for ockupation, including gigantes such as Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated since 70 years; this has not been adequately intensified since the first earthly oil crisis.
When the price of the oil entered in 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now the environmental organizations and the oil price are forced to be new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be covered by the energy produced by the Oceanwells.
This leads to the duplicate of the current energy produced by atmosphere.
In addition, the streams and times are still broken.
Gigantes at the attack.
The first firm, which is now on maritime energy, is Enersis, which has undertaken a Treaty on the creation of a power work in North Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are still more companies from the traditional energy industry that put on marine energy winning.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – the speaker of a US Gigant company in Wall Street Journal – and refuses to cooperate with us."
This is the establishment of a approval of the Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project before the coast of Alaskas.
This is an unprecedented sign, i.e. if you think that just in Alaska the Oil is continued to be promoted by the United States and the President Bush has recently set the plans for new trains.
Besides Chevron, the firms Ver日 Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new branch; are not details, but observers speak of a growing interest.
More improved technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in breaking, which is not late, since the last doubts of the environment are not yet claimed.
Thursday, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are very small and seem to be seriously caused by environmental problems.
However, to produce energy at a large level, technology needs greater impact on the environment.
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power at least uses a system of connected bodies.
The walls' shadow, which moves up and below, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimming over colds and cylinders.
This three places a turbine, which reacts to a generator.
The stream is sent through subwater guides to the coast.
There are four planned installations of this type, which are waiting for the State approval, and some of the gained energy can also serve for military institutions.
Ver日 Power already produces energy for a house of goods and a parkinglot with under-sea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the presents treat the turbines that are eating the generator through the coming movement.
According to Verʹ, a long shadow of potential clients is already expected to use the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
First the walls, then the times.
A particular interest is deserved by the Energy Research Institute in the present case of the potential that is present.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind streams, sun streams and wools, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
The current energy is what federal states such as New York, Alaska and other coast states and invested 7.5 million in 2008 – have already been planned up to 35 million for 2009.
