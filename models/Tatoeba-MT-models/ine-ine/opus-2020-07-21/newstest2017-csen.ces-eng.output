Czech roads invested in the modernization of vehicles over 31 billion.
They have climate and new toilets.
In the past six years, the State transporter invested in the modernization of vehicles over 31 billion crowns.
The third of the vehicles is currently equipped with climate, the half of the flames has a new closed WC system.
However, parts of modernization in individual years with exception in 2012 are gradually lost.
Czech roads in the last six years invested in the modernization of vehicles over 31 billion crowns.
The third of the vehicles is currently equipped with climate, the half of the flames has a new closed WC system.
The payment of money has been decreased in the decreasing of the average age of two years in lokomotive and separate units and six years in classic vagons.
The larger part of the investment has made the transporter to regional transport, where the amount of 60 per cent of the money was estimated, and 40 per cent of the company invested in the renewal of the remote transport vehicles.
The average lokomotive, and the current unit is 19 years old.
Modernized older vehicles, but in this indicator, are started as completely new.
The modernization of vehicles would not be calculated, and the prominent age of the CHD vehicles would grow about ten years.
Something older are in the medium of personal vagons whose average rate is 23 years at the start of modernization.
It would only be taken into consideration since the production date, the average older of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
Classical adjustments consisting of vagons and locomotives, however, in the last years of Czech and the world railways are gradually mixed and are replaced by motor or electrical units.
During 2011 and 2015, lokomotives from 280 to 223 cuses were similarly decreased by classical vagon groups from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of the year.
The carrier was delivered from the old vehicles made by skin seats and doors without the possibility of locking the opening during the wheel.
From January to July, he allowed the transporter to shoot 110 of these vehicles.
From the investment planning to the vehicle park to achieve in close future, for example, it is possible to introduce 50 vagon buying up to 200 miles per hour, which the transporter plans to set up on the international line of Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or a compilation for buying electric units for foreign Others.
The computing calculates up to 30 cycles of motor and 20 boxes of electric units.
The offices of the fourth year are concerned about illegal advertising, they can't be released.
We're absolutely impatient, acceptable.
A quarter of the year of the online journal Currently.ch follows the story of the billboard in South Czech, which is now the engineers to visit Lipna, where the tourists are not only interesting in the trees corners but also the olympic park.
The wallet managers think they're worth there, but they say they're not going to do anything with it.
Similar advertisements are over the whole country of hundreds, perhaps thousands.
According to the officers, there is a chatting law for which illegal mobile billboards are not possible to remove immediately.
It's needed to be a complex birocratic bottle forward.
Meanwhile, the company changes the name and the office is short on it.
Or the advertising is enough to move a few meters and the official process must be started again.
The Guideline of Roads and Roads a fourth year acknowledged: In the main knowledge of the Czech Republic of Lipno, the public billboard is on our territory at the state road.
Not for three months but the officers were lost to deliver unleavened transmissions with an insertive plaque.
Like no one would be able to stand close to the vehicle, in a 50-meter protective pass where nothing can happen for security.
The road managers claim that the billboard can't be easily advised by the law.
You can put him up and get him away.
"We can't just allow it," says the Chairman's Road Guideline and Nina Ledvin's Valley, and refers to a complex birocratic cock, which the removement of the billboard must take place according to the law.
The case of this specific billboard, whose judgment has started online journal Currently.ch to look for details on the jacket, is not unique and shows a general problem that cannot be stated and the authorities should be effective and resolved.
Only in the South Czech redaktions, the number of tens of similar mobile advertisements placed in front of the rules of the vehicle or in its nearby.
Likewise, there are other countries.
"We have to give the firms to remove the travelers," confirms the Chairman of the Transport Committee of the Czech Republic of Jiří Class, whose colleagues are the like stories.
According to the class, there's a deep law on the wine that the officers associate.
Forward, the owner of the billboard has to celebrate to leave the public.
But boss firems are often unusual or know the finth already currently.ch in the past, when the problem has started to be more detailed: enough mobile stone with advertising to move about a few meters, and the officers can precede the challenge to remove the black inzerce to go into the trash.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is standing.
"When anyone does not agree with him and coordinates once, he looks at it as a new equipment, and we must have the owner to celebrate again," explains Jiří Class.
The new law doesn't help.
The change could bring a new law that will prohibit billboards from September of the next year and limit them to the I. class roads.
Criticals indicate that the rules for the destruction of illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as yet.
And the offices don't go like that.
Companys can continue to make decades to hundreds of million corners annually and no one can.
For example, the billboard on Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials well know her: the Czech Republic of Czech Republic is currently conducting three administrative procedures for clearly installed billboards.
The company is threatened in every trisetting trip.
It's more advertising that were located in the I. class's protective street.
The management has not been completed yet, says Jaroslav Mraz, head of the Transport Committee of the Czech Republic.
The advertising that is not currently interested, even though it does not figure between these cases, soon to them, but with the greatest probability.
According to RSD Nina Ledvin, the company did not respond to repeated written challenges to remove, and the case would be made to the national table and, probably, to the magistrate officers.
Commerce Billboard community belongs to those suspicious companies that are not able to contact.
He has not received a mail and an official seat on the Jejkovi has been canceled over six years ago.
There's no one who's standing behind her.
In the past, the company's post was walking to the southern business officer of Anton Fischer, who listened to an easily dispute with the leader of the Czech Mark Hyundai.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard finds the desktops from Comerz Billboard and offers them to the incerents, however, in the past, refused any association.
At the same time, when RSD began to take up Currently.cz interesting on the advertising in Lipno, Fischer allowed the State officers to send a letter to the secret company Commerce Billboard to his pen, where the new company is probably sitting.
However, no one of this address has invited to the board managers yet today.
A marvelous fight.
Similar silence or intransparency changes of seat are not unusual.
One company, we gradually made two million crowns in the past a few years ago.
But she changed the name and ICO and it wasn't anything to solve.
The executor's returned, the advertising continued, maybe in other places.
We're pretty impatient against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like a fight against myllions, recognises under the subminal conservation of anonymity one of the officers.
The new law in this regard will not be resolved yet.
Currently.ch has spoken with some of the lawyers who had a problem.
Eventually, no activity.
Instead, the lawyers who wanted to extend the term to keep billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government refused it.
Billboards are not only for national but also national and general policies very sensitive and sometimes shizofrene topics.
On the one hand, the Community request after their limitation, and the other, it is the same for inzerting in pre-elective campaigns.
I don't keep the fact that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the laws.

Leaving and empty houses in the Centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you're walking around them every day.
One of the most crucial examples of the unusual and empty house is a light building of an earlier IPB seat in the Senovery Place.
She had been working as a hotel for a long time.
Nothing still.
Is it necessary to build new and new rooms and offices in the metropolis?
And what to use the existing, often valuable and protected textonics?
Right in the Centre of Prague in the non-resident of the Vaclav area is a number of workshops that, even through their position, size and often even memory protection only are empty and feed free.

Clinton is repeatedly returning to secrets around Trump receipts, otherwise in order to express doubts whether her companion is as rich as she says, the Agency introduced the AP.

Papa František met the twenty former prostitutes in Rome, which the police delivered from the power of the gang of passports.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the inspired stories of fallen women and then invited them to introduce the speaker Vatican with confidence in the future.
Among the former prostitutes that France visited was six women from Romania, four of Albania, seven of Nigeria and one of Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their medium is moved around 30.
All of them, according to Vatican during the needed prostitution, were made to a cruel physical violence.
In the visit, Frantiszek wanted to take care of the trafficking with people and call for the fight against him, introduced the father's speaker.
Francisco often warns about judges of people in the area of the company.
For example, on Thursday, he offered the Syrian rebels who arrived in Vatican in April and June by his personal invitation.
Francia's going to hit the product of the jihadists.
Without the help of the Muslims, it's not going to happen.
France has a fight against radical islamism to help muslims alone.
Moreover, the Government of Prime Minister Manuel Valley is a fundamental change in the function of mixing and education of spiritual.
We closed 20 mixtures and prayer.
And the other will follow, the Ministre announced inside.
In the country, over hundreds of jihadists are working.
"When Muslims are helping the state in fight against those who distort public freedom, it will be more difficult for France to ensure this freedom's recognition," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
To ensure, in particular, that in mixtures and prayers only the immigrants who were trained in France.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing the mixture from the laptop.
At the moment, about 20 percent of money comes from the foreign for the exhibition of new mixtures, most from Marokko, Algeria and the countries of Persia.
Even so, there is enough to mix the preachers who can seem radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that the Islam is compatible with democracy," added the Prime Minister.
The key to ensuring him to fulfil these objectives will be a new French islamic opinion.
This should work as a pool between the secondary state and the Muslim minority.
There's no money from the neighborhood.
Now in the country, the French opinion for Islamics, which was established by the Dominique de Villepin president in 2005.
It had already contributed to the transparency of financial flows between mixtures and countries that finance their exhibition.
Just that the institutions soon entered the internal divorce and rivality.
"It's a complete failure," he recalled recently Valls.
On the French political scene, Charlie Hebdo has been deployed in January 2015 after the attack on the journal, the debate on a new institution that will replace the non-resident.
All have succeeded further terrorist attacks in France, which have been radicalised in the name of the Islamic State.
The French Minister inside Bernard Cazeneve has recently heard that the new opinion will appear for years in October.
It will have two main tasks - ensuring the financing of mixture from home resources and also watching immigrants.
In the meantime, there is no place where it will take money not only to build new mixtures but also to different educational centres.
But it seems to be a few of us.
One of them is a special payment or a tax on food hazard.
In practice, the sellers would pay food hail for the certification.
A part of these money would then just travel into the bill of ideas.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 corners) could then be paid by the French candidates issued to Mekka.
Each year, they go to the traditional village to Saudi Arabia, about 30,000.
And not just that.
According to the Premier, in the mixtures in the future, only the publishers who have spent special educational programmes at French universities should be affected.
This should ensure that the preaching is in accordance with democracy.
We'll close radical mixtures.
The French government is currently in secret against radicals.
And others will follow, reported the Minister inside recently.
In France there is no place for those who report hate and do not respect some principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, according to estimates, approximately 2500 mixtures and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under radical islamism.
Since 2012, the offices have exhausted 80 immigrants, and there are several other decades that they consider.
Not everyone thinks that the government's steps can be extremely contrary to radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do it the same.
However, it does not happen in mixtures, young people are radicalized on the Internet, introduced Severine Labat, a expert from the National Centre for Decade Research.

Young doctors press: They want a fresh wind in the box
The representatives of young doctors have meet to adopt new steps in their dealing with the new association.
The Council of young doctors (JDC) with the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the whole Council to support other workshops from the beginning of September.
JDC says that the Ministers could not resolve questions about Âa.
Young doctors and medical students in July rejected the BMA agreed with.
It was rejected 58 % of its members who had voted.
In the letter of the members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the Government remained "and still a little" to questions, which would mean to refuse the contract.
She said: "In this light, the Executive Authority of JDC has decided to reject and request a new formal negotiation in all issues."
In response to the rest of the Government, the JDC Executive Board has formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the current programme of distorted operations from the beginning of September.
Spor led a young doctor for years to report to six stages, including the first general stages in the NHS history.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawan, resigned after decision to reject agreed submissions with the BMA recommended.
The members of BMA at meetings before voting before 54,000 young doctors and medical students said that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After voting to the Ministry of Health, she said that she would mean a grief for medicals in England.
Russia and Turkey: Communication of the "incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met in an attack to give their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long word war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the overburn palace in Petrohrada, I had a idea that Ankara wanted more after this disturbance.
It's got to give your hands, yeah.
But Putin didn't smile, and it's just exhibited the gravity, and it's also according to its declined standards.
Recept Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke about his "friendly friend" Mr. Putino - five times, as one of the news reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but will be better.
Another day, one of the local news wrote that Erdogan's acting like nothing bad would never happen.
I think his surprise was expressed too exactly.
But the survivoring cold that was excited from Putina showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he changed in his introductory words: the shooting of the Russian war airport Tureck on the Syrian Sea.
Moscow's reaction at that time was anxious.
Putin split the one around himself, and Ankara accused of killing Moscow.
The worst thing was that it came from a genuine friend.
Rebuilding a trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public change has also been changed by the employee.
The state of controlled media after months led a total campaign against Ankara.
At once, it looked like the Turks could do everything.
More important was the accusation of the superior state representatives that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal trade in the parts of Syria controlled by the Islamic State.
The guy's thrown it out.
But the official message came in Peter's garden that it was time to move.
The end of the end of this meeting was only because Putin had received a excuse from the President Erdogan.
Russia could report some victory too.
For Ankara, the advantage statements are notified.
In the first place, Erdogan was the last month during an unexpected shot almost saved by power and therefore all of his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also appeared to be disturbed.
There is also a economic motive.
The Russian sanctions had a strong impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which each year will transport a number of million Russian tourists to the surroundings of Turkey.
This group was almost reduced by 90 %.
It's about Russia, the tour operators and the charter company here they're going to breathe when it comes to the renewal of the flights.
It produces in the Mediterranean road by movement in the conclusion of seʹna.
Even this week, the state TV promised more lower fruit and greenine when the imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey would be allowed again.
"Turisté there, race back here," as it reported in the newspapers of Vedémati.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is lost to the West for what he thinks of a chab reaction to trying to turn back.
Furthermore, a long-term unfair debate on the entry into the EU and Putina entrance - which takes up to use and overcome the relief of Turkey with the West.
The Russian leader certainly received bonus points when Ankara asked her for help from the chosen bodies after trying to pick.
You need to understand that for Moscow, who has deeply injured fear of the change of the regime, it is given.
So summit in this pumped, direct-sea palace of Russia and Turkey enabled me to introduce what one of the analysis described as “uncompatibility”: how the forces of two countries are associated with which they feel rejected and used by the West.
Despite the public manifestation of peace, however, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The Syria is where Moscow has recently been built in the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on the opposite sides.
It would be said that after three-hour introductory discussions, both presidents on the printing have concluded that they have not changed the question.
The Turkish Chairman decided to highlight these differences in the question regarding the differences between them.
There is no agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common word in the question of Syria.
But after months of open enemy - and because of the risk of a complete disaster, when NATO Turkey has shot the Russian war aircraft - it is very better that both leaders speak at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for clients outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS mark must be attached to the back official role.
Royal Bank of Scotland will lose for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan said the BBC Scotland station that the RBS mark was connected to global ambitions of the bank.
She was raised from them when she was missing eight years ago and had to be buyed out of the debt.
At that time, the strategy marks used the ‘RBS’ to protect the final marks of the consumption funds.
It followed millions of freedoms issued for sponsoring international sport from the ragby champion of Six Nations after Winbledom Andy Marraye.
Now, however, it was decided that it was better to give more results in more than national marks.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scotland clients but will launch new trades.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the centre and encoding action on the burst, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Irish Republic and North Ireland.
There are other, smaller marks for private banks that will get more in front - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the road to clients and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered us to Ross McEwan questions.
The BBC station Scotland said: "The RBS is going to stop to be our investor mark and the label for which our employees work, because we now become much more a bank."
Because the bank himself became a global mark, it became a global mark and RBS.
Now I say we have no global aspiration anymore, we have an effort on the home scene.
Each of these marks will mean something very different in their own communities and our workers will work under these labels.
The RBS has already stated that to continue in its sponsoring of the Six Nations championship, she has prepared the profile of individual sport sponsoring marks.
"Their had a suitable time for us, and they moved to which mark, because the basic question (which we claim) is how to focus on it, and they became a better bank for customers?", introduced the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical when they said we'd become a great bank for the clients and the marks represented.
But together with how we focused on the needs of clients, not on our own, I think it's going to make a lot of changes.
We can remember these tags again, I think it's been the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the horse of Predilection led to the goal of 3000. wins
Dector discovers the Spanish after the two victories in Newmarket brought him 3000 wins
Joey Frankie Dettori made 3000 winners in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
This milk has reached his second victory tonight on his local trace - on the horse of predilection, which is trained by John Gosden.
The fifty-five-year Italian is the sixth joke, which has reached such a result in the rovinal advantages.
His leaders are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Matthew, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-party shampion of Dector's cheese, who wined early on the horse of Ghayar, said, "It's special."
I'm very worried because my family is here too.
I'm incredible that it happened in Newmarket because I've been injured here for 30 years ago.
It's not a cruel action, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a fifth night on earth with 20,000 people.
It's up to me, and I'm very grateful.
Dector collects happiness when it brings predilection after winning
Two jackies of this pool have reached in overcomings - a shampion of Richard Johnson and a 20-fold champion on the Pension Sir Anthony McCoy, which led over 4 300 winners during his career.
Lester Piggott, nine-based winner Derby, 4 493 winners in career
Frankie is one of the best hooks of modern times and isn't surprising that he reached a boy who had reached only a few drivers before him.
He's a puzzle and strong, but it's just his tactic fistron, which distinguishes him from the final drivers in the real estate.
He's an amazing ambassador of lowliness, his superstition, and charism have attached the fans to this sport for a long time.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't just been on weeks and big advantages, he would have 6 000 winners!
The truth is that Frankie has driven a victory in the Great Britain in the largest part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a lifetime attitude, which is good for British enough sport, but it is more important that he is an incredible joke.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous aeroplane shock
Since the years after the year-score - Frankie Dettori was a result of the British balance of two decades.
It was like a ride on the mountain streets.
Increasing number of wins of big leaders, including his known "velope seven" in Ascot, but he also survived the havary of the airport and had a prohibition of starting for drugs.
Three years ago, he was standing when he returned after 6 months of start, but demonstrated an incredible internal force and, despite all the doubters, he returned to the best form.
And maybe it's the last time - Dector has already declared that he'd continue to be in a devastating at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin left the Chairman of the presidential office of Sergei Ivanova
The Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly left Sergei Ivanov from the head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of the nearest Putin partnerships after many years.
Threety-five years of Ivanov was appointed by a special representative for environmental and transport.
The Report from Kremla states that Putin “slipped Ivanov from his services of the Russian President's head” but did not mention d·.
His place will be transferred to Anton Vajno, who was Ivanov's representative since 2012.
The fourty-five-year Wayno was a diplomatic before.
He was born in the capital city of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted the Pressive State Institution of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked on the ambassade in Tokyo.
On the web pages (Russian) it is noted that he has made the Chairman of the President's Protocol and the President's office.
When Putin was named, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important role of the administrative role is to support your national head-up activities in the meaning of laws and controls, in which way your instructions are maintained.
Putin on Friday, the Russian TV station indicated that Ivanov asked her to be released from the station and recommended to replace her just Wayna.
Didn't you smile?
This step has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergej Ivanov was a long time for one of the closest partners of Vladimir Putina and was working for KGB as well as Putin.
As the Chairman of the President's office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At the meeting with President Putin, who sent the state TV, both men declared that the Chairman's office is from the head of the Office.
But the smiles in the camera were convinced only a few little people - especially now, just before Parliament's elections.
So is this the result of a fear of power?
No one knows that yet.
But the official statement that a man who had ever been considered as a possible president, once wants to conduct the Russian environmental policy, has agreed with a great uncertainty.
On the Kremlu pages, notes are quoted to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to talk to this very urgent post, even to say a problem post, I believed for four years.
As it seems, I was the Chairman of the Presidency for four and eight months.
Ivan's post was taken in 2011.
Before the president of the Government and Minister of Defense, he stopped.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and was working for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) who replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed by his representative.
When Putin came to the power, he named Ivan as one of his five nearest companions.
At its time, Ivanov could be a representative of Putina in the head of the country after his second electoral period, because the third period would be contrary to Putina.
But this post took another near Putin's co-operation of Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became a Prime Minister before returning to the President's office at only three and a half of the year later.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the mystery of the crimes, was released after what the register determined
Gibson was involved in the physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
Television stations ABC and CBS, which produce the series, have been notified in the joint declaration of its release.

There was a result of creative divisions on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry that it happened," he said in the statement.
According to the ABC and CBS television stations, the details are how Gibson's position will disappear from a series that follows the stories of the FBI team agents, about something about a lot.
The four-fourteen-year herd, who glorified the main role in the Dharma and Greg Site, was in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the misunderstandings and in the last twelve years I gave them heart and soul," Gibson introduced in my statement that he delivered on Friday.
I hoped I'd be in him until the end, but it's not possible now.
I would like to give my thanks to the authors, producers, herds, our team, and especially beautiful fans, in what time this show could have hoped.
The return of the series to the twelveth series is expected on September 28.

The man from the town of Banff asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 kiss of fish can be the candle rings that left the water wheel there.

Queensferry Crossing: Most now connects with Fife
Project for 1.35 billion free must be completed until May 2017
The engineers joined the north border and Queensferry Crossing and Viduct - the most now connects to Fife.
It is therefore the first of the four conclusions between the “features of the floor” which are currently completed around each of the three pillons of the pool.
The part of the pool from Fife is now a length of 600 meters, and it deals 30 000 tonnes.
There are 10 000 tonnes of iron and 20 000 tons of beton and 46 coastal lans.
The project for 1.35 billion libers must be completed until May 2017.
The Economy Secret Keith Brown has visited the building today and was among the first who came from the peʹna to the pool.
He said: “This is a historical moment and a symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
For this project, we all have witnessed how building engineers, in effect, used more than 30 000 tons of beton and covered for this part of the pool.
Despite the massive dimensions and the weight of the pool, the finalization of the conclusion between the viducte and the broadband of the delicate operation, which required extraordinary accuracy.
At its place, there is now more than 79% of the total board of the pool, beton for the last part of the board is now driven in Rosyth, so the whole width is ready to highlight the wood.
Michael Martin, leader of the Forth Crossing Brie Constructors, said: “The conclusion in building every most is an important milk.
This conclusion represents a tissue of the earthquake for this relevant project.
After installing the last part of the road area and its connection to the spreadsheet of North Tower, we had to close the last sea on the north side - directly to the peʹna.
We did this by protecting the North Nearby Viduct by 700 miles southern direction.
This was a mass and a very delicate operation at the same time.
As a result of the viduct is a length of 222 metres, it is estimated about 6 000 tonnes and it was needed to cut it with some 3 % steam.
Delicate because the tolerance with which he worked was very small - just a few miles every way.
Everything's been very good.

Peter Tluchor is one of the three businesses that, according to the demand, had to be obtained from the Premier Intime and his so-called cabinet of Jana Nagy Political Trade, thus the lucrati – post for political approach.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Snader, Fux and Tluchor enabled him to resort.
Then they appeared on impact posts in the State firms.
That is why they also understood the tax and ended for a month in connection.
According to the court, however, injustice, and they expected a total damage of almost 2 million crowns.
The teacher now comes out as a witness, and it is after the command of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in the court building on the fruit market and solves civil disputes.
However, he wants to be cautious to judge Helena the Queen (resolve criminal matters - c. red.) and to preach to possible visitors.
The case, obviously, will be made to take care of another practical court environment.
The king's faults Jane Netime, before Nagy.
It was a particular deficiency of military divorce to investigate the first wife of the Prime Minister of the Nevertheless Radka.
In this case, Tluchor didn't figure.
The lawyer Jaroslava Ortman said that it was an unexpected reaction.
I think the independence can't be made so that the court may be excluded, if the Witness has a wife or a family in the court.
I'm afraid it wouldn't be able to judge anything, he's noticed for a journal.
"I think it looks small," added.
In the case of political traffic is also accused of Roman Boček, former officer.
According to his lawyer Petra Tomana, the casual trip would have a chance to succeed.
The Court of Auditors for Prague 1 negotiated on 13 June a party of the Prime Minister Petra Intime Jana Nagy (then Netimes) and other accused of the disuse of the military report.

One of the schools is already dead!
The girl was obviously lost at the aircraft of connective forces.
In Syria, with his two old friends, she went along with the same country in the north of the Londry Airport Gatwick.
The British Ministry is inside the report of her death.
Young Londonians who fled from home were secretly transferred to Syria through the Turkish border.
Shamima Beguma, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana were moved according to the media for their other former partner from the London School Bethnal Green Aentem.
The case of Loni has also called a huge wave of attention and an impact in the challenges between British and Turkey.
The British Safety Directories believe that in Syria there were some 600 British Muslims, some 50 young women and girls.
Some of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home represent the terrorism threat for British.
Working dreams for hundreds of payments.
It's a great job you don't even have a high school.
So it looks like the first view of the work of an age.
And often to the other.
It is not only in the Czech statements extrêmly high payment (in Praise you work in IT up to 180 000 Kč), but also in extreme benefits.
Dìm is a major lack of IT specialists.
There's thousands of specialists missing.
According to the estimates, there are almost 20 000 IT specialists in Czech.
The most searched belongs to Grafton's personal agency, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
The candidates can choose a few job offers.
So it doesn't support candidates for the job, but the position of the candidate, comments Jitka Součkova, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school isn't needed.
High school education is not needed for the students.
High school education means a good basis and is a general indicator of the candidate intellectuality and education, but it is often not much common with the knowledge of development.
The students need to continue to do new things, which once a high school does not replace, says Peter Kubačka, Director Monster Career CZ.
It's most likely going to be in Prague.
Acetics are moved over all over the Republic's area.
For the most money they'll come to Praza and Brna, it's no longer such a hitpair in the regions.
"The Mountains in Brna are comparable to those beaches," confirms Cubačka.
The highest performance will be reached by the directors of technology.
In Praza and Brna, they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 C.E.
In the remaining regions, it is lower, but it doesn't be under 80 000 Kč.
Questions are also IT project managers.
At the end, 60,000, 100,000 C.E. can be produced.
The battle is also about absoluteity.
While in some professionals, the solutions often must be equivalent to the work office, they do not pay it to the stakeholders.
The company's to move and pay a professional from another company, and they will be able to make it possible.
They can learn him according to their own.
They're not going out without a language.
The knowledge of the foreign language is walking in every profession, but the aequalities are needed to be minimally obedient English.
At least one foreign language is the need for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases when companies seek professionally educational and experienced persons and are only satisfied with the median knowledge of England.
However, for example, the support worker controls more strangers, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more clients from different countries, adds the manager Kubačka.
Joo in Goog, there he is.
Only silences can be able to get Czech workers in Goog.
Of course, it is an effort for them to work time, opportunity to work from home or different decreased accounts, not only for mothers.
"Increased fathers give the company four weeks later allowed after the birth of a child," said Martin Jonek, speaker of Google.
Increasing health care for employees and family, feeding, transport, training, wellness or mass directly on the work.
Whoever wants to educate, he has the green, and doesn't matter what a new one wants to do.
But the benefits will not end.
This is also free for the full ship.
a healthy dinner (in some places and dinner and dinner) is available every day.
Moreover, in all of the offices, there are micro-cookies called where people find a healthy spot, speaker.
And so that nothing could be able to get out of it, so it's gonna get into a box that employees can take home tonight.
And what about these in the Czech situations of unbelievable benefits?
Create creative and motivating!
"For Google, it is not important to workers sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, movement or development, ideas and innovation solutions," adds the speaker.
The United Nations criticized Bulgaria for the criminalization of injuries.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, U.S. Commissioner for Human Rights, charged Bulgaria on Thursday that systematicly violates the human rights of criminalization.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian Government " calls serious concerns for Bulgaria's not having international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussen warned in the statement.
He noted that "is particularly concerned to be a witness to how important and affected public characteristics express public support for criminal armed fights, which dress yone on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that at least all people who go to the Bulgarian territory are automatically attacked," Zeid said.
And what is even worse - they are often punished and conceived - for a year or a long time - if they try to go out of the country.
Their attempts to go out of the country are criminalized, despite everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own.
Bulgaria has held 14,000 migrants for the same period for 21,000.
Poquemon Go - health and happiness that will be paid
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
A number of people in the last decade claim that teenages and children are not playing outside and gives the priority to free time in front of screens.
Pokemon leads people from the shot and leads them to the activity.
The time watched before screens was plying on TV, playing video games and the newest on smart phones.
It's great to see that the activities and activities outside are not uninterested.
Of course, I talk about the mode that is Pokémon Go, ́e based on stations that first appeared in the video games at the end of the 90s (after there was a drawn series, game cards and other).
Similarly, as in many cultural phenomenons, this new game has occurred before the start of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand to reduce the interest.
The introduction in other countries was then denied because of the potential interest that led to the transfer of servers.
Poquemon gained him during several days more than Tinder and almost so many artists like Twitter.
How does that work?
In short, players on a smart phone will go out to search for Poquemons watching by GPS, and if they find them, they can be "foto" (with a phone shoot) or "cape".
Mani's celebrated a generation that in the youngest game plays, brings her out of the seat and women out looking for Pokemony.
In the United States, this game has reached a significant increase in the number of steps that the "small" person will make every day.
The Cardiogram application for smart hours from Applu, following 35.000 persons, recently for Washington Post, reported that during two days from the start of the game, the number of followed people who were weakened every day for 30 minutes, hopped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company does not have information about who Pokemon Go plays - sees only the brutal data on level habits.
Many public campaigns trying to “receive 30”,“release from the gatch” and “they were active every day” have fallen on the non-natural ground, because the public health messages are poor and designed to people who don't look well.
However, the importance of the vaccination should not be subjected.
Those who habit regularly reduce the risk of illness of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is shared in the control of weight, high blood pressure, sugar and a long list of contributions that we can't enter here.
But the beauty of the Pokemon Go game is that people go out and do something that's funny.
You cover three miles of health - movement, fresh air and sun papers.
Some people even get new friends when they're moving for pokemons.
As soon as it is, they will, of course, find these poor patterns who seek any intention to be able to slow down.
And yes, someone can come to the door.
What, what?
He's been in the middle.
At their time for smart phones, like Fitbit, they were able to follow our activity, but they didn't give us what to do, and they did something like that in this game.
The news is looking forward and the interest of it will be done at a certain moment.
Of course, thanks to the success of the Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine and reality with activity in the world and help a lot of people in moving for activities, health and better forms.

Simone Biles won gold in a number of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the surprise.
Simon Billes is immune to all that.
Dynamic on the cross.
Don't get us on the clothes.
Everyone's on the simples.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, a olympical champion.
The ninety - year - old American gymnastic went on Thursday directly after the title in the multiboys and finally under the olympic reflectors.
The total outcome of 62.1998 confirmed its speed before silver medalyst and the member of the team of Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalyst Aliyou Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during the spring on the board in the final of most individuals in sports in the 2016 Year Olympy games in the Brazilian Riu de Janeir.
Billes became the fourth American in a series of winning more boys, and the fifth totally when she confirmed her story of its best gimnastics, perhaps the best of her generation.
When her total final evaluation was on the table and its long road until the end of this moment, it appeared on the face of the lions.
This success leads her to the same legend of the united atlets of their time as Michael Phelps, who added to their sport a new dimension:
Billes has dominated its sport last three years, has won 15 medals on the world championates - including 10 golden. Its wonderful components are ambitions and accuracy and the olympian shampion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton called her as the "best gymnastic as she had ever seen".
The last trial was waiting for her in Brazil, not even between Billes and the rest of the bathroom, but between herself and her too large expectations.
Anything else than returning home to his family in Spring in Texas with full golden medals, it would be conceived as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), and Aly Raisman are involved in the winning of gold and silver medails in the final of a woman's major warfare in the 2016 Year Olympics games in the Brazilian Riu de Janeiru on Thursday.
Mr Biles obtained an appeal when she was as a coach in the celebration of the national team coordinator of Marthy Karoly.
Billes' cares that during her long road on the top, she never looked forward, but it's not so completely true.
The part of her compositions in simples - the one that contains for her typical three salto with double turn - is based in Latin music, which would just come home, to the street outside the olympic arenin in Riu.
That's not a chance.
The girl adopted her parents as a bathroom and her talent discovered the mother of Aimee Boorman's trainer to the bodyway where Boorman trained and gained power.
Competition has not been spent since 2013 - it is a sled of victory that can continue as Billes will.
Although Mustafin took a short lead through two islands, it was just a illusion.
Claudina and simple - where Billes finds a world championate - they wait.
She got back to the head with 15,433 points for the station - and ended with 15,933 points in free.
Raisman's whispered her when they waited for the final skin - only formality - and around red, white and blue sticks, and Biles' lakes were opened when the desires that she had ever written in the journal were fulfilled.
Wicon Raisman was so little payment for olympiade four years ago, when she shared the third chance with Mustafin, but then eating bronze for the sum of three best ingredients.
This time the twenty-year-old team team, called the Americans "baby", was about enough forward.
After her simples, she sent a donation of air pools, getting back, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Billes, that this ninety-year-old atlet placed on Twitter this week, where he became a perfect hit, completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in the case of a series of killers shot when listening to music in the car
According to the police reports published on Thursday, two women and girls died in 12 years during the most important decade attack, in the case of the first series murder in Phoenix. They were shot when they sat in the car, they spoke and listened to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis Maleah were shot on June 12 in the car parked on the road.
The report states that a weaponsed man stood on the side of the coach and burned eight ran from the hand, and then sprinkled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it doesn't be a triple murderer, because the attacker didn't take money or $2.900, one of the adult victims.
The speaking police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that investigators find out whether the shooting had no connection with some of the previous four attacks.
During four months, two majorly Spanish quarters have been killed by nine attacks, where seven people were killed and two other persons were hurt.
“It happens in the village quarter before the house”, stated Howard earlier this month for the CBS CBS station.
Police believes that the suspect used a few cars, including nissana, from the end of the 90th, black BMW at the end of the 90th and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence of the conclusion that the attacks were jointly related and carried out by the same murder.
Ellis (33) was transferred to a hospital where she was injured by her hurt.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died in the place.
The police witness reported that it wasn't unusual that women were sitting in a parked car and listening to music.
The offices also published the police report on the shooting, which would like to be an empty delivery only half a half hour before the killing of three times.
The investigators found the boxes and the rest of the cups in the seat, and they made a cup under the engine cap.
The mother of a six-year-old child with a micro-coffee: "His status improves"
Edmund Piʹuto, like the children of his cup, loves songs, players, and, of course, also his mother.
But in part from its kind of rubber, the microcapitality that is a result of genetic injuries that his mother, Elizabeth Pi, did not know during pregnancy.
When he came home first, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
What isn't the truth - I think you're prepared for it," she said.
She and her wife Vincent learned that Edmund could never be recognized and that she couldn't even survive.
Some doctors even claimed to be placed in the system.
"My first reaction was that I thought people did not do this anymore today," explains Piité.
Edmund's walking with a coach.
Until three years, he couldn't sit down or be plassed, and he's still not talking.
Some trailers are quickly filled.
He's coming with the advice and running on the road.
He also plays with his two brothers and loves songs.
Elizabeth leads a signword, which Edmund says, " Please, sing to me."
"We're teaching him a signword," said Pi^ut for CBS News.
But it's not a timely sign - says Edmund's invented some signs alone.
Microcephalia can result from a number of different states: genetic, such as Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused viruses such as cocktails or Zika.
Symptoms and predicts can be determined in a significant way.
It's too quick to do it, and they could say what impact the Zik virus will have on the lives of the deceased.
Pi'outs at the emotional tax that he chooses of an uncertain future.
I'm still asking, "What's going on?"
What's going on?
And she's still not sure.
I never wondered what the general predict is because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But the pi'out has an encouragement message for the mothers of all children suffering by the boys of the kids caused by Zika virus.
The situation is improved.
You know it's gonna be better.
You'll love your child and your child's gonna love you.

According to Krautmanna, the observer reported that from the north to the fifth to the fifth, 35 × meters of rain trees fell.
Krautmann said the ground is strongly increasing from the middle.
The authorities indicated that the expenditure and payable roads were requested to save residents from their homes during Tangipahoa periods and to cancel training in five school circuits.
The WWL station CBS reported that, according to the oldest of Tangipahoa, 200 homes were spent.
The people were evacuated into two churches that are both broken but now.
The elder of the foreigner Robby Miller noted that the offices saved 72 people and seven home animals, which had high water captured.
In the neighborhood of Amite and Hammond, the town of Hammond was designed for those who were evacuated.
"I'll be able to return home until the water begins to swallow," he said.
In the area of Tangipahoa in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed, and local residents were available to a fishing that could be raised and trying to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last large floor here in March," said the manager of the city of Lacy Landrum.
It seems to be like these floors.
Rupert Lacy, a crisis manager in Harrison's town in Mississippi's state, stated that there is a sustainable rain on the border of the Persian village.
He said that a few homes were announced on Thursday, but no of them had appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, leader of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, lives for 40 years.

Mahaj Brown (6) - "the boy shooted as a shot", survived the shot in Filadelfia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia. This week a second shot on a child in six years in the city.
Ancient kids identified her as Mahaje Browna for the CBS Philadel.
Parents say that the boy suffered a few shooting hurts, including weaknesses, feet, watch and breasts, but when he was transported to the hospital, he was at home.
"He took that terrible power, his little body was spread as a sole," said his grandmother's station, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe that.
The boy's in a critical condition in the hospital, and he has made a few operations.
The family for the station said the boy should be healed.
He had to go to the first class of the basic school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in Germantown.
More three men were shot: two in 29 years and one in 32 years.
One of the men in 29 years is critical, according to CBS Philadela, are two other victims in the stabilised state.
According to the report of the station, a child was found shot on the front seat of the vehicle together with a ninety-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police checked if some of the hurt men could be a shooter.
Research station CBS Philadel acknowledged that there was probably a shot between a few armed men.
In the place there were a refugees from the guns of a type of attack, belonging to different attack weapons.
According to all, it was absolutely sure the continuing battle.
The street was a resident on both sides of the traveler.
So it seems that there were several armed fighting persons who were actively involved here," he said for the police station Anthony Ginaldi.
There were also a few houses and vehicles in Âa.
Nobody's been arrested and the police's carefully checking video games from the camera.
The next six-year-old child, this time the girl, was shot into the guard of a blown shot in front of the house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl's calling and the police still looks for a suspicious.
Why are we Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
Just like this, I'm supposed to imagine a woman's guinea team for years of olympy games, and it's just a few of them.
First, I was on every yearly olympy since 1984 and the United States were never so dominant.
And for the second: In this team there are three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Hernandez, who inspired so many young color girls.
Everyone is proud of the layer of this team, which supplements Aly Raisman, a Jewish pump, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
The presence of the black and Latin Americans was also fallen on the spices of this sport.
The Gymnast number one in the past four years was African.
Simone and Gabby were in the first and second place.
That means something.
On the last olympy, Gabby Dougals became a shampion olympian hers, and America was awakened.
Now the world could be a witness to an incredible fulfillment of the three-party world victories of Simon Billes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, which had led unexpected, but mystery gymnastic figures.
In Thursday, Simone became the fourth American, which obtained gold in a woman's more individual battle.
And the member of the team Aly Raisman got silver.
We're witnesses of the sports top, but it doesn't seem that in the hours of the gymnastics in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie decided to the Olympian team the same way as Aly and Madison.
They're a "final five" because the team of the next olympical games will be compiled only from four athletes, and this is the last year when Marta Karoly's train.
The reality, however, is that the genetic is financially significant sports and gimnastics are training mostly in private gymnastic clubs that maintain parents who pay costs for trains, equipment, roads, dresses, taxes for competition, hotel accommodation (for trainers and their convictions and families). And this is not far away.
Most of these sport clubs are in rich areas of activities that can support.
In these clubs, all trains and the family of gymnastics and gymnastics have a cost and costible commitment.
Aimee Boorman, the trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez, trained both athletes at the time they started in the gymnastics.
It is our obligation to bring the trains of gymnastics, which are more available and accessible communities without number of young girls who inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I've found the gymnastic hope 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or lower costs in Harle for more than 15,000 young people in the city (over Black and Spanish) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroitu (my family town), where we will provide quality gymnastic to young people who will deserve the opportunity to take up and distress from this great olympical sport.
Gymnastics develop power, intensity and coordination of the body and strong work, discipline and decision-making of the mind.
This combination means experiences for good health, success in school and work.
Just inspiration of this team will send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastic.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, because you have shown a "beauty force" and you have wined olympian teams. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all youths to be released on the road with healthy, strong and successful young women.
After refusing Jeremy Hunt’s treatment, young doctors are ready to enter the other stakeholders
Ministers hoped that after the closure of the processed with the representative of the British Medical Association (BMA), the failure of changes would be completed, but 58 per cent of the 37 000 young doctors who were involved in elections refused.
In July, Hunt discovered the plans for the exhaustion of the NHS in “nobody’s land, and another late would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
Young doctors have already signed a new construction, which includes changes in night and weekly working procedures with the aim of improving care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA committee for young doctors in the report last night, stated: “Young doctors still have serious concerns regarding the subjects, especially in the sense that it will increase the current working force crisis, and so the fair inquiry with all doctors.”
Eight weeks ago before the first group of doctors goes under a new with, it is necessary to achieve progress and time.
The efforts of BMA to resolve conflicts through negotiations have been met with an unnecessary involvement of the doctor and often with the disturbing silence from the Government.
And despite the promise of Jeremy Hunt from last month, this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, attack the exhaustion and solve the fears of young doctors."
Young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last stage at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were allowed because sisters and specialists were allowed to arrest doctors who were among protestants.
Ministers hoped that after the closure of the processed with the representative of the British Medical Association (BMA) will be concluded in the case of changes.
BMA wants a higher payment for work on weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to −.
Daniel Mortimer, President of NHS employees, invited young doctors to not enter any staff.
Mortimer said: "The work action will only reach a little or nothing, but the pressure will occur on the already so difficult teams and services, and the growing fears, disturbance and disturbance for patients, health careers and their family."
In the past two months, we acted with the advice of young doctors and with the Ministry of Health and finally reacted positively to their concerns regarding the role of supervision and information.
Workers hoped that continuing to engage in other important issues - such as study, flexibility at schools, further training for those who return after the interruption of career, training costs, mutual recognition of items, study freedom and share in payments between headings - was a evidence of how seriously employees, Health Education England and Health Ministry take agreements reached with BMA in November, June and May.
The medicine may reduce the risk of infarction by sixty roots per day
Thousands of patients threatened with infarct will be able to use a drug that is estimated about sixty crowns (two-five). The offices recommend to give it more patients after a longer period.
The treatment against blood disorders Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recovery in humans with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after the infarct process to reduce the risk of mortality or other infection.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends to be given to humans for four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends to be given to people for four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
An infarct in England suffers about 140 000 people every year, and the fourth of them will be more increasing or heart slaughter.
Infarct and deadlines are caused by replacement of the tube that creates a relative level on the walls of artria.
It can result in the survival of the inflammation, the blocking of the blood access to the heart and the result of the heart infarct.
When the syringe is released, it can continue with the solution, block the cause of blood into the brain and cause the brain mortal.
People who have already spent an infarct have been increasingly higher risk of further inflammation.
Ticagrelor, which produces a British company of AstraZeneca and is sold under the business name Brilique, reduces the risk that the injury is less likely to occur.
In the light of the NICE Directive that was published today, patients are recommended to reach 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, which is two times daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, manager of the Nice Health Assessment Centre, said: “Over the availability of the secondary preventions of treatment there are a quarter of patients who have an infarct and who will achieve further heart-release or death - often with devastating results.”
Repeat fear may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient’s life.
Ticagrelor is demonstrated in combination with aspirin in decreasing the risk of other heart infections and deaths in people who have already been infarct.
We are glad that, in the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the possibility of treatment available to many thousands of people who will be able to suffer.
Because information on the ability and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of blooding - above three years are concerned, it is not recommended for treatment over this period.
Computer culture has started to rebuild subwaters in the Muslims
The oldest city of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was revoked last year from corruption, which was connected to the government message
Political correction culture leads to the monitoring of broadcastings in the Muslim communities, which is recorded today in the government report.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles criticizes the police, electoral inspectors and advisory officers because they ignored the use of electors for "ethnic sensitivity and religion".
The former community secretary, now the government of anti-corruptible resources, said that the fear of the electors on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons and protected electors from election rooms.
He recommended that elections with themselves take the identity evidence and can show who they are at the choices.
Now the chooser is enough to enter his name and address.
The message continues to play on the fingers of persons when the voice is executed, to bring an insultable injury to prevent someone from choosing two times.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
Requests the pressure to get more access to documents from the meeting and decisions adopting the official committees or group's workshops.
"The protection against electoral underwaters is not only about, but also on the protection of local governments from larger corruption and financial subwaters that are in hands," he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a result of the electoral scandal in Tower Hamlets in West London.
In the latest year, the Special Election Court decided that the Officer of the City of Lutfur Rahman should be revoked from his post after the conviction of corruption and illegal practices.
The Court believed that Rahman “chinics ” had a religious feeling of his Muslim communities and washed his critical accusations with racism and islamofobia.
Rahman, according to his words, “he brought his campaign so that he might be the religious obligations of the faithful Muslims to vote for them.”
Up to 300 voices were doubted or as a result of the identity claim when a person votes and is issued by someone else.
Sir Eric stated that there are evidence of substrates throughout the country.
He expressed special concern for subwaters in the corresponding vote - which is stated that the elderly members of the Muslim communities during - have developed a pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the photo, gave a few recommendations to clear the optional system, including the provision of the identity evidence
The report states: “The evidence of the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially for women and young people, has been developed a pressure to vote according to the will of elders, especially in the communities who entertain Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“The fears were that... the state institutions had committed such behavior to "the right political" supersensitiveness against ethnic poetry and religion."
Sir Eric proposed 50 recommendations to clear the system, including that political activists should be prohibited to manipulate with the corresponding voice and to prevent the “refugiation of votes”.
The report which is currently valued by Theresa May, also requests more controls in registrations to prevent the use of optional lists for immigration sub-hydraten and doses.
Consider the possibility of requesting the voters to present a document of identity before voting.
The use of an unusual inquiry on the fingers of persons in voting to prevent someone from choosing two times.
The implementation of systematic controls of people in order to ensure that they can choose.
Requests for automatic corresponding vote to limit for three years.
To prohibit political agitators and activists to manipulate with reliable corresponding voices and elections.
Give the police permission to create around the election rooms of the cordon.
Amendment of laws to make it easier to enhance the persons developing illegal pressure in accordance with the reform law of 1983.
Disable assembly of photos in election rooms.
Require that only English (excluding Wales) work in election rooms.
Enhance training and ensure that workers keep the rule that election cabines walk individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says he is "excusing" that after Tower Hamlets has not been accused of crimes.
"The Court of Justice for election issues made Lutfura Rahman and his agent for Lithania corruption and illegal practices," he said.
A number of deficiencies has been investigated by the guilty of doubts - in the power of evidence of criminal acts.
It also criticizes the continuous “controls of throats” in the offices for the registration of electors in the board.
Sir Eric said: “The decision of the Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets’ Awake.
Our nation has a strong link to the Parliamentary Democracy College, but anxious and anxious extension of electoral subjects and the status of rejecting certain authorities threaten this reputation.
Fornication of the cyclic duplicate of Kate and other known characteristics on olympy in Riu
The Olympics of Olympics in Riu 2016 have been deceived this week to the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which is ideally similar to Cambridge.
But the fourteen-year olympionic is not far away from the only athlete that enhances the gold year, which can be encouraged by its own doubler of a number of known persons - at least not by social networks.
For the celebration of the Olympics Hers in Riu and all known characteristics that are present on our screens, the group for FEMAIL women has set a list of olympionics that are more than remotely like Hollywood celebrities.
As famine beast: The member of the American team of Brady Ellison (left) was compared to DiCapri

The leader with the Brady Ellison arms team caused the Twitter storm after his photos were drawn up, which ideally like the wall of Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the median crazy and admitted that he heard his similarity with Lee from a little bit.
"I don't see any great similarity, perhaps other than you," said Brady for Huffington Post.
"It's a fault and it looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most earliest comparisons from London in 2012 will be highlighted more in the years of doubt: the ideal image between the British shock at Greg Rutherford and the favorite hero Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian Guinea Aliye Mustafin with her big, explicit eyes said it was a copy of the Cuban-American songs Glorie Estefan.
And when we look at the floor base, the South African vessel Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of Gell Matthew Morrison for a few years.
And for change: The user thinks that Nathan's "atletic version" herce from the movie Start (Inception)
The next year's comparison is the comparison of the tennis stars Rafael Nadal and the herce Joshe Hartnett, who have similarly the right hands and mouths.
The Russian silver floor Yulia Efimov is proud not only to eat the same feet and blond hair as McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the United States fans say he looks like "Atletic version of Joseph Gordon Levita".
Frequency Women: Star of Hope Solova (left) and dexter Jennifer Carpenter series (right) has a similar face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very happy that the similarities were noted and the last
Theory on waves: According to this holder, there may be a d·i for a similar view of couples
One Twitter teacher recently expressed his satisfaction on pages that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solova and Jennifer Carpenter are in truth identical."
Football star Hope Solova and heritage series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter has an incrediblely similar face of face and eyes.
Among other favorite comparisons, Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is exactly identical with the smile of Laura Linney's hair, or the golden medaile holder for Gabby Douglas's gimnasty, cutting with her beautiful smile, which is like to copy the Gabrielle Union's smile, the Bravo film stars, girls!
The commentator of the Olympical Her station CBC is concerned that about the Chinese floor said that she was "building"
The divs of central live transfer from olympian hers to the CBC station built the division of the conduct of fourth anniversary Ai Yanhan's commentator Byron MacDonald. The floor ended at the fourth place of a woman's conveyment at 4x200 m of a free staff.
The Canadian CBC station was required to be apologized after one of its comments said that the fourteen-year-old Chinese bottle during the construction “traveled as a middle” and “exhausted”.
The commentator Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was disabled when at the end of the final staff of women at 4x200 meters freely began to cross their own views.
MacDonald, who had to bring “release” to the team of CBC comments, stated, “This little fourteen years of China has given it, you crazy.”
It's a pretty excitement, she's like a smile, she's exhausted.
Thank you.
The Chinese floor of Ai Yanhan (14) celebrated the second staff of the divorce at 1:57.79 - so about 1,61 seconds less than the Canadian Taylor Ruck and enabled the Canadians to reach China.
Wonders in Canada began to call online and were scared by the tone and the language that the commenter used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "The voter declared to CBC that a fourteen-year-old fishing from China was "build"?
The idiot didn't notice that he was still in sending."
Ai Yanhan, from China, was described by a 4x200 meters of freedom as: “The little 14-year-old of China has given it, you blame.”
Byron MacDonald's criticism came from all sides and many asked for his revocation
When Twitter guards learned how an insignificant Byron MacDonald is, they didn't keep up
Another girl, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like they were a band of racists.
Soon afterwards, Scott Russell, who sent CBC, apologized for the living comment of MacDonald and said, "We're for a comment on the execution of a vessel, who avoided sending."
It was an amazing choice of words, I'm sorry that it happened."
The CBC station finally apologize for more than 90 times people who tweeted in response to comments
Co-commentator Scott Russel had to apologize with MacDonalda
The CBC then copied and placed their excuse in response for more than 90 Twitter clients, who tried to note MacDonald's comments
The station also apologize and published the declaration.
She honestly grieved that the words were expressed, she shouldn't get into the eter.
We've quickly apologized our kids in sending and those who follow us on social networks.
In order to be fair, Byron's comments were related to the execution of the vessel, not to the vessel alone.
Byron is deeply concerned about what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a living sentence and tried to explain his note to the statement that he did not want to be a personal attack.
"I wish to apologize for a comment I introduced last night after a woman's staff," he said in sending from olympy to the CBC station.
"I was thinking about the execution of the floor, not the person of the floor like that."
"It isn't necessary to say that I had no intention and hate me very much."
The clients in Primark are disappointed by a woman who unfortunately tried the underground staff in the trade
When a woman tried to trie a bullet at Primark on the salesboard, they did not purchase the assurance to look at.
In order to be worse, she tried how its size falls, her knifes dressed and brought them back to the royal.
In the review, she continued and finally tried four bullets in the shopping center of Bouverie Place in Florakestone.
Business Primark in the Buyer Centre Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where a woman tried a cow before she returned to the royal
The mother of the two children of Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the business, noticed that a mysterious woman after the test of the underground cup, “he dressed and went out of the business without buying anything. ”
She said, "The people could not believe in their own eyes."
She stood in the trading, took the bullet of the royal, dressed her own girlfriends and bottles and set them up.
"They didn't even try to find a discrete place - just standing there, keeping it like a bird."
"Each one just saw how the bullets dressed again, and obviously they didn't like it because she returned to the regal."
She did the same with three other before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, she dressed and left.
"He seemed not to be sure who looks -- nor would she think of a man who could buy a cup that she tried."
After Davidson (33), who lives in Kentu, said, "This is the imagination that anyone will take the house of a cup, which no one had on himself, and no one has cleaned them. This is a deceitful."
The event occurred at the afternoon breakfast.
After Davidson, she added: "When she went away, I gathered things that she evidently tried to make it out of the sales -- which is the only right."
"I would think I'd bring a new cup home and make sure that she had another woman on her own, dressed them, and they weren't excited."
Primark's language trade said: "Primark knows about the incident in our trade in Folkestone on July 9 August."
All the products concerned were downloaded from the sales.
How to prevent the attack of weapons using Kqua Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com may be more safe for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a very mister of Kqua Magy, sitting in New York, and we tried to consult armed bullets in close distance.
This video will show you how soon to get over the violent one, that he may get close to you, or back.
It's always close to you back, says Mizrahi, and then the first thing you have to do is to turn back to see your attacker and "they have a free way of shooting."
Then you understand the weapon between your plans and your brain exactly before you go into the face with a free lock.
Then he follows the knee into the weakness, and while the attacker lights in pains, turns his weapons from his hand, shoots it mainly into his face and starts getting up, then you will keep the weapons on it.
When a weaponsed man approaches you, it's a similar technology - get your body out of the rubber line, capture the gun and make it fit so that the donator can't shoot.
Give the weapon of strength and shoot the attacker into the horse, then shut the weapon from his throat and start walking, continue to die at the same time.
Does that sound cool?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does.
But don't forget that the most safe way to get out of the passion - if you're not a very mystery Kqua Maga - is to issue all preparation.
Traveller Ian Wright olive the most popular places in Europe to a traveller
The British traveler decided to make a difficult test of his immune system and a recent reflection - with the olive of the most incredible and incredible places in Europe.
The Ian Wright's traveller and author (51), in Suffolk, for the proof of its imunitary system's strength, enhanced its language of the Eurobank, engaging on Piccadilly Circus, the pressing on the toilet in the wall and the Russian public phone.
Before all objects were approximately used to show himself and to all of us in which he was going.
The experiment, based on which the Lickhiker's Guide film was Inner Strength, brought interesting results.
The idea to slow down the flash button in the floor, used by thousands of other people, can seem to be absolutely relaxed, however, in the kitchen tree is much more damageable.
Ian Wright spoke with doctors and specialists in the health of strengthening the bacteria of central flowers and its own health.
Unfortunately, nothing of his oil left nothing worse in his mouth than a calamity.
Ian Wright was praised by testing the distantness of his stars on the roads around the world and eating wonderful and famous things.
During this mission, he completely tested his immune system - from the public awards to the inflation states after spray
In the movie, he said: “I have been aware of my health from childhood, and I have given my mouth everything possible, from the bullets of the eating of red and the bathing of water."
He confirmed his reputation in the movie.
The only thing he refused was the spending public ships in Russia.
After a simple steel, the value showed more than 4000 units.
For comparison, heavy hands should have less than 60.
One public department in Russia but refused to olive after what his meter showed more than 4000 units, while honestly cut off his hands less than 60
Ian Wright and the Finnish milk product manufacturer Valio round the traveler's movie named The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the bathroom
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the worst thing I ever felt on the bathroom."
It doesn't exist more than this!
Nothing to olive, because it's inconscient here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was enlarged in cooperation with the Finnish milk manufacturer of Valio.
Mr. Wright's company provided Valio Gefilus, which contains bacteria of milk acids and vitamins C and D, which helps people to strengthen the concentration of the bacteria and the immune system.
Niko-renmaa, an elder vice-president of Valio for divorce, juice and new category, said: “We wanted to offer some new work to the employees.
Something that would be followed by the prison, and it would allow us to explain the provisions of probiotics.
We have imagined a lot of foolish ideas that ended with the idea "Let us call Ian."
It is said that the world's phenomenon is the interest of the heat health.
Instead, and only about manufactures, we wanted to give them to larger relations -- good and bad bacteria in our daily life, the importance of the health of the ground and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthcare is the global phenomenon, and we have provided more information to the users in interest.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who recorded the film, adds: "Let's say this, Ian would lose my respect if he had lost something of what I wanted after him - as if it might be the unfortunate Russian bathroom that appears in the movie."
Some things were naturally easier for Ian, others were very hard again.
I'm sure we've seen the olive of some of these spitting things."
In 2015, the Valio community conducted an investigation that 84 per cent of the respondents included milk acid bacteria, especially with the health of sugar and steel and 58 per cent of the respondents, indicated that at least the possibility is to use products containing added milk acid bacteria.
The family of socially needed before the exhibition of the general building in Saltash city in Cornwall
The family of the social needs left damage at its general home at 50,000 p.m. after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were moved from the house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long range of disputes against them.
After their violent exit from the house, the officers of the housing company were shocked when they found it in a havary state.
In the wall there were streets, the ground critine was cut off, the walls were broken over all on the ground and the walls were cut off.
The family has already moved and has to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, manager of residence issues in Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned whether she would save the house.
She said: “For people here it was a nightmare, and I don’t think people should live like this.
It is necessary to consider a number of circumstances, because this opportunity is probably invoked as “not so beautiful part” of Cornwal.
This family is unhealthy known, and their names are undeservedly known.
Parents have three sons who lived in the house sometimes, and the police indicated that the horrible government of the family was a road battle with the use of baseball pairs, fear of environmental populations, drug consumption, drug distribution, and voice crying, hazards and reliefs.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned on the payment composition, was granted in June an anti-social conduct.
In some rooms in a house that may be built, there have been discovery waste.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, there was an exhausted basic crisis.
Neighbors say they've seen them on the street, and people have regularly called the police.
The Cornwall Housing company moved her and her partner from the house this week after they received an additional 11 weeks to move up voluntaryly.
The neighbors who were resurrected welcomed their lives to be an alive hell.
One of them said, "They did not fear anyone."
We lived near them 20 years, and it was like that.
As many times we saw the police here, it can't be counted.
"We couldn't sleep today."
We arose because there was an incredible silence -- we're not surprised!
It's gonna be nice here when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the supervisory manager in the neighborhood of Cornwall Housing, noted that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family in the house lived 20 years, the police was regularly invited to the house.
Odds and old games were increased in the larger part of the present house
She adds: “It is reasonable that the payment has not been able to take responsibility for her own conduct and her family’s conduct.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions according to the witness had to treat her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police from Devon and Cornwal and the members of the local communities who have informed us.
I hope that this step will bring a little consensus to the neighbors, and at the same time it will bring a message that we will tolerate the uncomfortable behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the payment, who lived in the house in different times, were about 20 years.
Disappointed matrix, which remained on the base of one of the rooms in the house after the movement
Workers will now have to remove the holes of losses that remain in the house
In 2014, the police carried out in the house of race and found more than 70 grams of conopy, weight, equipment and 1 700 £ in preparation.
Skeldon received a pain when she was looked for a guilt of drugs in class B that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that money was designed on the basis of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died at the car accident in 2013.
It is because Tanya and her partner now live in a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls in many house rooms were decorated.

Turists in Portugal feared after the low transition of the military trick aircraft over the beach
The tourists who were exciting the sun-papers in Portuguese Aveir were a fear of death
Portuguese military airport P-3C Orion passed to incrediblely low
The military aircraft declared that it was a normal year, and that it was not a risk of security
At the moment when the low flight tricker was laid down over the full beach, she kept the scared panic tourists.
In dramatic campaigns, it is to see how the military aircraft gets far away from the sun to the people at the sandy beach in the city of Aveiro in North Portugal.
The tourists started to know what the sound of the engines of the pressure aircraft was disappointed without seeing what will be out of darkness.
The incident came to Costa Nova yesterday in the nearby city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the recreators who published the video players of a dramatic overflow on social networks, said: “The flight was two times low, and at one time it seemed to be seen.”
Nuno Arroya adds: "I was surfed, and I really thought that the flight would fall on my head."
The tourists on the beach in Aveir were scared when the flight was shown down from darkness
The Portuguese Military Airport today stated that the P-3C Orion pilot was at the ordinary year to identify fishing ships at the border and must be low because it was the only way to check the ships.
The airplane was evidently flying about something lower than it's usual, because of a bad vision caused by rain from nearby forest fires. However, the airport remains that the security of people was not threatened.
Forest fires during the year destroyed the part of the Pe’n Portuguese and requested four victims on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Military Airport today stated that the pilot had to fly low for the fashion of milk and fucking fires that were protected in view of it.
The Airport was at the normal airport and the pilot was requested to identify fishing ships in the training.
Half of the funeral services does not comply with the provisions.
The half of the suppliers of the funeral services does not comply with the laws.
The Czech Business Inspection (CHOI) has tried to check in the second quarter.
The funeral services under it do not most often inform the rest of their prices or give not the written confirmation of the receipt of the negotiations.
CHO for this has stored 41 pounds in the total value of .000 crowns.
He informed her speaker Jiří Fröhlich today.
The inspectors tried to doubt at 47 of 95 controls.
Without information on prices and missing confirmation, some funeral services also sold products or provided services for other prices than they had been collected.
In five cases, the sales were not properly marked and once the seller used an officially uncertain weight.
The inspection was therefore prohibited to sold 23 products in total 7077 crowns.
It seemed to be packed on urines, crystals on lights and weights which were not correctly marked by obligation information.
"When this specific service continues to be violated by the law, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," added Frählich.
The London School, which joined the IS, was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolers who went out of London to join the IS, died in Syria.
Representative Tasnime Akuniee said that the family learned about her death in the Syrian Racce a few weeks ago.
The ITV News announced on Thursday that it was probably killed during the Russian aircraft attack in Racce, a battle group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just at the time she was prepared to flee from the war of the wounded country and to return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good in all this thing - as a message and a warning for the end that this is a danger associated with the way to the war zone - it is that they will turn people away from making decisions," said Aknee.
Sultan and two other students from Eastern London were arrested in February 2015 to the airport to Turkey and then to the bus to the border of Syria.
Sultany's family learned that she had been in Syria for the fight of IS - and during a few months she had been awakened.
Reid says if Clinton is chosen, he'll leave Garland as a candidate to the Supreme Court.
The leader in the Senate of the Democratic Side of Harry Reid says it is convinced that the President's election candidate for the democracy of Hillary Clinton nominates judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the case of his election.
The republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's name, although President Barack Obama had named it already in March.
The leader of the Senator Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the judge of the Supreme Court will choose the future president.
Reid announced on Thursday during the conference talk that Clinton's choice of Garland “with a certain degree of confidence”.
Reidova's speaker reported that he was not talking directly to Clinton about whether Garland would nominate, and that he just speculated.
He appreciated Garland and said that the team of Clinton would not want to "shoot the ship".
Garland is the president of the Federal Revocation Court in Washington.
Reid said that the republics blocking Garland's name are "services" and "scook" of the Republican candidate to the President of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wouldn't go to the office.
According to the Traats magazine, they are the first calendar for "women and men"
The magazine Treats azzz cooperates with David Bellemer's photograph for a calendar for 2017, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 70s.
But instead of discovered characteristics, you are trying to find another generation top model.
President Treats Steve Shaw has already informed us that his magazine is filled with the playboy from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
Apparently, the calendar also believes.
"We have to return to show overtime and classical distress when women and men feel pleasantly and let them be inspired by women's body photos," Shaw stated in the printing statement to issue a calendar.
Women want to be part of this project, because it's a wonderful cup of art.
Models can send their photos online or personally during opening shops in Los Angeles and New York.
Where's the winyl: Who actually buys grammophone tables?
Vinyl loves single men in the middle.
Before you decide the sections of comments to pay pepper notes under the pseudo-NeAllOsamiliUseIt's Central Age, we submit that this expression comes from real data.
According to YouGov, so much discovered resurrection of grammophone tables is not associated with the wood of milenials who want to love the original property of the physical subject, but with the nostalgia of the central cup.
Those who have recently buyed albums on the vinyl are probably people in the chair between 45 and 54 years.
Young people in 18-24 are at least probably.
It's not actually not about the fucking fan - all this has emotional dimension: the elderly who buy gramophon tables, probably want to keep their feelings (56 % versus 53 %) and are themselves (69 % versus 66 %).
But are YouGov's outputs true?
If this blog was sent up as a television reporter, the camera would look at me as I'm looking forward to the strange street in Soho, dressed into a decent-sheet dress and gesticulating. Then I'd stop, stretch out my hands and say something of authority, as, "Let's going to see it."
So let's go look at it.
As soon as the heart of Soo is quickly exposing his charm and cup - buildings are sometimes occupied by independent sellers, now hotels, restaurants and eatings, conferences and office needs have been filled - a few fantastic specialized businesses with grammophone boards have remained.
I'd probably ask the camera for a minute to stop the shopping, and I'll stand near different men in these businesses and try to see what their eye and emotional division is.
Stuart (55), a parent from Glasgowa, which I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three men of the center) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight men of the center, one woman around 20) has a afternoon meeting in London and watchs businesses to fill a few hours.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got some 3 or 4000 puzzles.
All these boards slipped the walls of his inhabitants - on the picture up (foto sent me by email, I didn't follow him home).
This huge volume of albums and singers also has to be allowed: it can now buy grammophone tables that he couldn't allow when they got out and bought up again what he sold in the youth and had no wind.
"More of what I bought is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12. Then I was too small and couldn't arrange them," he says.
They agree that those who purchases their bills are probably introvertising what the company has, and he adds: “I do not shoot nor drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of clients he met is falling into YouGov profile.
He also observed the new influence of people affected by the median wheel. People who heard about the comback and felt needed to buy their old grammophone tables back.
According to my discussions, people were most frequently released between 1998 and 1999.
The clients who sold their grammophone disks once and buyed a CD, now sell their CDs to buy their grammophone disks back," he says.
This could explain the boom of grammophone boards of some.
But what's the evidence of the emotional importance of the grammophone boards?
He will not take you more than a few seconds to make sure in the trade as Phonica you will find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts in music trades.
According to Weze, some elderly clients are particularly harmless by the system of uncontakt payments.
Some gramophon board providers can feel payable in the digital world and have decided to be known for the rubbers of grammophone boards, things that he calls for peaceful growth.
"I think filling the area or property of something weight can bring a certain comfort," says Wez.
I'm a colleague, I'm here, and I think many people too.
It's a easy way to fill the place in the head.
“We are all as their social work”, a collaboration from the grammophone boards.
The ICM study in April discovered that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album in a month ago have not yet heard it.
According to the investigation, 41 % of questioned grammophones that never use, while 7 % of those buying grammophone disks have no grammophone.
In this point, the reporter was probably seeming to be seriously worried in the processing of a gross compilation of boss new.
The aspect of the "trofey" and the survival of interest is something that Jonny observed (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (start: three men of the Mediterranean).
"Nobody came recently and said, "I don't have a grammophone yet, but I want to buy the radiohead tables, and they could put it on the pool," he says.
The percentage of these is not big, but it's going to.
It's more about the product page than music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a grammophone."
They're younger people, not the elderly, they're growing pubertants that get to it.
Fopp, where at the current time at least one pattern has been replaced by grammophone tables, has a lot of different visits in my arrival.
There's a couple of seventy, tourists who do the chairs, puberts and women in the middle.
While the atmosphere is not so released as trades before - from players instead of a tough jazz is the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesers and sex, it is good to see different clients.
No one of them seems especially single, but the inner soul of the trauma will seem hard when we stand near someone 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) is spent a few minutes in Fopp and watchs different grammophone tables in the floor.
It's one of those who's looking at the exhibitions than to lose bitterly.
According to his words, she doesn't work much, so she doesn't look at the grammophone tables.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or similar, but the grammophone tables have their knife...," it's uphilling.
I can't explain it -- it's unique.
My last delay is the business that evidently inspired a new generation of grammophone grammophone boards: Urban Outfitters.
I think I'm a very rejoiced girl in the boyfriends and I follow a group of native girls who just shoot around the Polaroid cameras. Then the father and his daughter decide to buy Crosley's gramophone.
The left is a stage with the wall cut off Adele, Jeffa Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: mixing of current and classical music, based on any average grammophone assembly.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't reach them.
It's purely "vinyl trick".
But because any attraction to him could mean more money for the sector and send a few clients to the Soo depth for another, it's not much to do.
There is no surprise that demographic, where the most probably is more time and money than in the ends, is also where the most lost of the most luxuous goods which winyl is certainly.
But as I find out, it seems that YouGov's outcomes are accurate - so at least in grammophone board trades, they do not take account of a large number of collectors and lovers of vinyls that exist in the ability, in trading with grammophone boards and online forests.
These people probably work hard at schools or offices.
It is certainly not a quarter-term breakdown on tradings with grammophone boards on Berwick Street, a recording and avoiding the view of a wonderful, thirty-year-old television modernator, which is hidden behind nothing in the middle-country men.

The Court in France refused to deploy trade in the Jungle River
The Court in France rejected the order of offices in Calais to demograph the democracy of tens of provisional trades and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of rebels live.
During the proceedings of this week of the office in Calais, the state should be able to cancel 72 provisional trades where people in the camp sold goods, from cigarettes after energy drinks, offered holding hair, in provisional restaurants, for sale of tea for 50 cents or for some euro basic foods.
The Prefect Office in Calais argumented that the places are necessary to exploit because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay tax, and because they mean the dangers of fuel and health risk.
The humanitarian organizations at the court indicated that trades and restaurants are vital and that foods are free to offer by State supported associations and other groups don't provide food additives for increased numbers of disorders in the camp.
Increasing provisional trade and restaurants often provides free food to people in noise.
The Court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis that would prohibit people to operate 72 provisional trades, but indicated that Calais prefects were "very comprehensible".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the sales of food, coffee and restaurants have much more role than just the use of food to people who live in extremely devastated subjects.
He said that the rooms provide quiet places for the meeting of volunteers and volunteers.
One of the places in which the democracy threatened was the café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which operates an accidental organization, which offers 200 foods, hours of English and French and azyl advice for hundreds of threatened non-flying persons without delivering into the camp.
Fifty for the protection of the "child" coffee signed more than 170 000 people.
Guardian received a letter to closing the café “is a disaster for these children, some of them are only 8 years.”
The charitable organizations of Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday considered that the number of hosts in the camp after the growth of incomes during the years increased over 9 000 - which is the most of all the time.
You thought he was dead.
Ulch crosss himself and the boybal Oast.
"From March, I could normally train," he reported at the start of the air preparation in full power.
What happened to you?
I had an amazed flash embolies, then because of the problems with the heart.
Because when I was at the University in Korea, I didn't know I had blood problems.
So the move has caused long years to Asia?
Two years I've had a little fun and I didn't know about it.
I was worried, no one found anything to me.
Then the throat got up.
It's a devastated life in the kidney, that's still pain, especially when it's slow or changed time.
But nothing that would limit me, more aesthic thing.
Did you care about life?
He had.
Last year, I didn't know that I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there anymore.
I threw the blood last night.
Doctors told me that it was something else, I was five days fully set up.
I thought I was dead in the Treviers, and my friends and family.
I've seen somewhere else.
How did you compare that?
I'm supposed to have to live it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems that I have to watch more when I fly somewhere.
But it's gonna be done with that.
Just when I wanted to go back to Prebrama, there were still problems with the heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I was constantly prepared for my own home to be able to play again.
I'll claim that, I'm physically better on it than before.
What are you expecting from Usa?
I'm glad that the party looks good, I know the lot of boys.
I'm expert on two other strangers who'll come.
I hope we're going to sit humanly to pass it.
Will you lift up your mouth?
It had a story of a discovery, but every season is different.
Brno two years ago was eight, now the second ended.
There's a new team in the mouth, just a few players left.
It was the last in the extralization, so it's a big room for improvement.
When we use him, it's on us.
We'll see the first rounds, who's going to be discovered, we may not.
Is the security of the success of Brom?
He's already tried and lived much, he'll think about better than the last place.
But my arrival didn't depend on him, I agreed before.
There were other trainers in the game, with one of the big friends, and it was agreed that it would work here.
It's a name to call me.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I am.
My big name, he was in good clubs, trains many decades, is an ancient good player.
Put us up.
What are you bringing?
This team will fight what's my position.
I'm fighting, hecuum, and I'm getting a chance in a team not such a big team.
I was two years in Prebrama, but Usti is a more demand than being in the sixth team, because it begins from the bottom.
You've changed the strangers, the Australian Boehm is already trained in the Oast.
How does he look?
I know him with circumstances, we played against us at the university in a group.
And a few times we were together, sometimes we were sitting together at night after the bathroom, so we're already familiar with friends.
We destroyed them 3:1, I just missed him at the start of the year preparation in Ustie.
My Slovenian girlfriend, he's a good girl.
The American Nazdin and Brazilian Ze will still arrive.
Do you know something about them?
With the American I wrote, it looks like a good boy, Brazilian who knows how he's going to teach English.
You contacted the American?
I looked like a good idea.
I'm a player, so whoever creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I just discovered what it was for players, I found me on the Internet, playing, seeing a video.
He was all right, the boy of a bitch, he's high.
We wrote a couple of messages on Facebook, it seemed like a cockpit, he's going to come to us.
How do you rejoice in the position of the player unit?
I didn't want to take anything else.
It's just fourteen and four, and I don't have a chance to screw it.
I'm better in the center of action, I'm able to lead my team than someone else to lead it.
I wouldn't like to play anymore if I should be a second player and do it for a full time.
How many times were you one?
A half in Pribrama, when it took Kust as an ́an, he hurt, and then there were problems with money, and he left.
Since that time, we stood up and I still played.
In the Brna, whom I was dealing, I shot the one and the two.
A voluntary year was in the Old City, after him I had a lot of offers, and I just chose Pribram.
They wanted me from that place, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold Number 22.
The short depth remains Phelps' domain.
"Be again on stage wins and hear the hymne is sweet as ggecky," Phelps smiled and then had the eyes of the full lakes again.
His neighborhood and his mother were looking for again, the son of Boomer this time calmly slept his ears.
I'm going to live an inconvenient week for the end of the career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started to flourish and it's gonna be in a few hours after everything, said he'd be crazy.
In Phelps' final, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino was stayed for two seconds.
Bronz obtained Chinan Wang Shun, a bronze medalyst in this discipline from the world's lower mastership.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (flow) is Michael Phelps a third sportsman who controls the same discipline on four games behind.
After the divorce, Phelps and Phelps held the next American Ryan Lochte and the house of Thiago Perreira.
While the covering of the gold in the final royal fifty-year-old royal, they fell out of the medail position.
The American superheart will have at least one chance in Rio to expand its unique medail collection.
Shortly after the celebration statement of the hall, he put to the final of the ship of 100 meters of the moth.
The legend couldn't even shake the country of Ryan Murphy, who received a sign-double - after hundreds of wins in Rio and a double trace.
In the final, he left 37 cents of the Australian ship Mitchella Larkina, the third ended Russian Jevgeni Rylov.
While from the world's lower mastership, Murphy has only five places from the two, he became a signatory king in Rio.
From the mental throne he seized Larkina, whose double is the same one on the bottom of the world’s championate.
On the olympy, but he got the medal just now.
The Canadian Penny Olexiak and the American Simone Manuel were divided into the Kingdom centers of gold.
For the sixth anniversary of the Oleksiac, it was a fourth medail on these games, for Manuel's second after the silver of the stafe.
Plaveck gold was obtained to OH as the first African story.
I believe I can be inspired for the last.
These medals are for everyone who comes after me, sports will become love for them, and they will get there, where I'm, told the deceased Manuel.
Third was the Sweden Sarah Sjöström, who wined a bathroom of 100 meters of motyls in the Rio in the world record, and still has silver from the kingdom's bicycle.
After the sixth ended the world record of the Australian Cate Campbell.
The Japanese Rie Kanet wined a bicycle, for which it was the first olympical medaile in the seventy years.
He has no valuable bone nor from the world's mastership, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Riu was obtained by Russia Julia Jefimovva, which, for the start of games, has been in the past with the immortality of birds and cohesion.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the court and I don't know why I should still answer these questions.
I'm very disappointed from that, she said the Russian floor.
Just starting in Riu has been able to be at the special sports panel’s CAS arbitrage just before the beginning of her.
They cared about my call, and I won.
If someone likes it or doesn't, or if he has another opinion, to return to the arbitrary court, she added.
Hermann: Excuse me, we could win.
And starting at the midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs lived a special day.
They just didn't know who's going to be against.
They had to be able to make a tactic preparation.
And then, in the non-radical times, the ship was started at a small curt number 1.
They did not start well, and they reached the shock of a companion, but at 19:19 they did not end the end.
In the second, they were better and compared, but the determining tie-break did not come out to them.
Moreover, a number of services shown meaning the depth 10:15 and the olympic tournament.
"We could hurt the Russian," he claimed Hermann.
How would you evaluate the depth?
Hermann: After the noble start before I was played, so we got beautifully in the game.
At the end of the last balloon, I've been driving the advantage that I used before.
We lost a hundred of keys.
In the next section, we put on them with an overview of the screen, another defense, and we took the service.
In the tie-breaku, there were horrible injuries, and we took it on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could hurt the Russian.
Love: Damn at the beginning of the first century, we've been running there.
We could download it, but we missed points.
The second hundred was great, and in the third, he decided the service.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and about the five, we had a lot of hot there.
It's damage because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the small room number 1?
Slucana: Like in China in the neighborhoods.
The center and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour in the night, full silence, no music played, nowhere.
That was the department of the center.
Such submines haven't chosen, but we can't choose ourselves.
What was the preparation for the storage when you found the name of a hour before the ship?
Hermann: She was special.
We started to blow up on the ship, without making the players, so we couldn't make a tactic preparation as for the final teams.
But Simon (Nausch kitchen) accepted a tactic at almost all the opportunities that were there.
He had a lot of papers with tactics, so we were very well prepared on this page.
Do you remember that you'd sometimes start the midnight story?
Hermann: I'm sure not.
We played at half 11 but not at 12 years.
Rusky Birlov's block in front of play-off on OH in Riu.
Beach Balists Market Slukov and Barbor Hermann in front of play-off on OH in Riu.
Was it inappropriate?
Love: By playing the last two ships in a group of ten, we had a regime moved before.
This was two hours more.
It's special, I'm not going to imagine that another sport has sports who have to give their best performance in 12 hours.
But I think we were prepared as well as we could.
We knew that it would be, but it's not typical, and it's likely having a favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the olympical experience?
Hermann: Since the process was our target group, it's on the one side all right, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm silent.
Love: I'll sleep from it and I'll take on the olympical tournament only positively from the morning.
The big brother is here, the first SIM is coming.
You won't miss her.
The new rules shall be applied to all persons without Thai, which will decide to arrange a SIM of some of the local operators during the stay in Thailand.
So not only on tourists, but also on persons with visions in Thailand, for example, who work or close marriage there.
The Secretary-General of the National Department and Telecommunication Commission Takrn Tantasith informed that there are no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan designed exclusively to foreigners represented a national telecommunication regulator at the beginning of August.
New measures to enable monitoring their positions are intended by the authorities to carry out six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is an architecture to maintain national security that will enable the criminal activity of just strangers.
Moreover, such tourist SIMs have aid to discover the persons who exceed the allowed residence length.
In the case of sellers to the half year, the SIM, which is exclusively designed to Thailand, should also appear special SIM for foreigners.
The difference will be directly monitored, which will be permanently enabled in the case of persons appointed without the Thai pass.
It won't be possible to disable her.
"That's not at the SIM for Thailand, because you can easily follow," added Tantasith.
It must be added that there are no anonymous payments in Thailand as in Czech.
The seller requires the identity evidence.
On the other hand, one of the operators distributed free SIM starting tourists in the airports.
You were so anonymous.
The introduction of the same measures as Thailand also considers ten telecommunication regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore.
The SIM registration is currently applicable, however, is not possible to be legally used by the monitoring system.
The remaining measures, however, do not mean the obligation for strangers to arrange when entering the SIM country of the local operator.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in that case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country, therefore, after the border is over, know only relevant network information after the SIM login to their network.
So they know the phone number, but never information about the owners.
However, the distribution of roaming prices to exceive the rate of local operators is so difficult that even the tourists in their livestock in Thailand will begin to be viewed by local SIMs.
The position of the offices to monitor the movement of strangers was legally expected by the strangers living in Thailand.
Tantasith is quiet and, in relation to privacy protection, the system is along with the obligation to provide resident addresses in immigration documents.
Police will also need a court order in case of investigation.
Any disturbance of the system will be threatened closer to an uncertain criminal.
"If a service provider is to follow the SIM position without a judicial order, he will be accused of a criminal act," added Tantasith.
The system should also maximize the use of pre-payed cards.
While currently the recycling of a specific number until the 90-day period after which the SIM has not been reported to the network, it may be new to the renewal in the case of Thailand leaves since 15 days.
The Luxury apartment in the new building on VinoHrades has a basen and a terase reliable.
Why did you choose a new apartment?
We've been looking for an unnecessary apartment where the ability cares for an old manager.
The submin was enough for parking places and expenditure in the house, which was actually designed by an elder stop.
I don't talk about the problem accumulation in the old houses, the problems with the hazards, the higher energy ability and the same.
The submin was also big terases, which the old department is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits will be found in the modern apartment magazine.
The entire interior for you on the tect Lenka Langer with her college Camlou Polako from Artiga study.
Why did you feed them right now?
Would you recommend to cooperate with a professional everyone?
Co-operation with the context → Recommended to everyone, if it is inhabited from the beginning, is a very complex technical process.
The second level is a single design of the internal: designers have a significantly better idea of the scale of potential materials and on the basis of the customer's desires, they are able to suck the internal appropriately.
With Lenka Langer, we have already cooperated on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a customer's personal recommendation, and because everything worked well, it was a choice for us and when we rebuild our new apartment in Vinohradech.
What were your practical and ethical requirements?
We liked a great community-habitant room with the corresponding area for a four-party family being taken as modern but never cold interior.
The priority was to achieve the association with thereases and to carry out smart home management.
And, of course, it was necessary to watch the quality of performance.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or have you put yourself into the final form of the internal?
We have approved all our technical designs and models of materials, but we have taken the detailes.
At the beginning, we figured out what we expect from design, and we showed some elements of the internal elements that included in us, such as coppers or images.
I think that just our collection of Czech authors, including Karla Malicha, Karla Utsušila, Václava Squelly or Otto Gutfreund, helped to orient on our whisper.
Similarly, the combination of black, white and oil tree was the idea of the idea of the same as the individual cups of the habitat, walls, floor, lighting, coppers, textiles, arts, etc.
Has there been a complication to which you have to give up pp ideas, or to access a new?
I hope only in the introductory phase of the project, when we came to build at a moment when it was possible first to go to the height of our ground, and they found that the views that we planned were shaded by the environmental buildings.
Then we changed the letters throughout the night from the foundation.
On the kitchen line, even on the wall of the blood wall was used by yellow.
In the inner, they overcome the tree surfaces of supplied skin, such as eating and colouring Norma woods from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Do you want any changes here, or is there something you want to have different today?
I mean, it's about the modern air-interior, which is mainly filling his loop.
We don't get changes, the number of adjustments after the movement was played in the area of shade and habitation of the teras.
I hope the only outcome is to the ground when the oil tree shows us as too cold in the house with the dog.
Vocabulary, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Hornih, authors of performance.
It was therefore possible to make a completely new available solution and a few other adjustments in the building.
Interior is an important element of the location of lightways in the stream of the woods and the main toilet.
That's what we got a daylight in the dark apartment.
The direct entrance of the main bathroom to the USSPA basin is also one of the building adjustments that were very eligible for the whole apartment.
The part is also basen and reliable.
In comparison with France, you are not negative, the Muslims living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are a cop from Algeria.
I was born in the south France, a bullet from the Spanish borders.
I've been quite moved.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied a journalist in France, thanks to what I came to work in one magazine.
So why did you decide to leave the country?
I started to feel that I was a soul in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Majorly because of the atmosphere among people.
I thought every French is very negative.
People in France are negative charges generally, but at the last time it has been worse.
It's interesting that you mention exactly negativism.
Some people are worth such a Czech power.
Trust me, you're not negative in comparison with France.
Some people may not be like that when they come to France, because they don't understand it as a tourist.
But it was too much for me.
A big topic is needed for money.
People feel that they have little money, but the minimum forest in France is 15 hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's a problem with the behavior of people against the Muslims.
That's totally incomprehensible for me.
For example, in the street in which I lived, my unmuslim neighbor began to look at me through the fingers just because I was a muslim.
It's like I'd be the same bad thing.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you just choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work at anywhere else, and I went to a free place in Air France here in Prague.
I recognize that I didn't know Prague from the beginning.
I did something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me what happened in Czechland, but I didn't know what I was waiting from Prague.
I've been here for three years and I'm not going to imagine I'm not living here.
Was that a big division when you moved from France to Prague?
Majorly because of all other atmosphere.
Maybe it's not to speak chess, so I can't catch any negative reactions or reactions, but I'm feeling people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress me anywhere, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone still looks unfairly on you, perhaps if you have special clothes and similar.
I started looking real free in Praza.
I don't care about such things.
Where are you doing now?
After employment in Air France, I worked for one web path.
Then, with one friend, we found the web pages on which people offer and seek shared residences.
We are acting only in Prague, but they wanted to expand it to the whole Central Europe.
Do you have Czech friends in Prague?
I've got two very close friends here that are Czech's half, and two more Czech's friends.
I need to say that the next specificity of the Czech is that the first time it holds more decline.
They're not going to leave someone soon to the body.
That's the whole range of the place where I grew up.
They're all in the south and like the face.
Here's another, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you weren't talking chess.
Is there a problem for you?
Instead, I have it too easy in Prague, because everyone's talking English here.
Even in dinner or in food.
I'd like to learn chess, but I don't have so much time.
And by making everyone a little communicate in English, I don't have such a need to learn the language.
And every time I have a similar problem, there's someone who's gonna help me.
Did you even met the negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a muslim?
In fact, not.
Maybe it is also working in the international rubber, which is more tolerant.
One experience attacks me.
My leader, Czechland, once told me about the French Balls team and said something in the meaning: 'Cause they're not French but African.
That touched me very much.
But that someone would have a problem with being a muslim, that happened to me.
And even though a colleague warned me once on the same anti-muslim demonstration.
He said I shouldn't go to the center they'll give me there.
The anti-muslim demonstration is partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current action work on you?
We're afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen to Prague?
I feel safe in Praza.
But the problem is, it can happen anywhere today.
I couldn't imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just Muslims.
Moreover, the Islam doesn't recognize the violent.
For me people who kill not Muslims.
The Koran says man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you do when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very hard.
I'm feeling funny and wine, even though I shouldn't feel like that.
I'm trying to don't follow these stories of violence, but every time I read something, I need to take care of something that's not my fault.
I'm totally another person, so why should I take care of terrorists?
We met Jiri from Pobebrad.
In the middle of the Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about it.
But I understand that people feel needed to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they should do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty of something they didn't do?
Are you meetings in Prague and other muslims?
For example, my partners are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious detention than me, so sometimes we've got a big debat about islam because we've got it a little different.
I'm coming from France, so I've gone through another education, they may have been in the school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate islams with the underlying position of the woman.
How are you doing?
I'm not in any case in the middle.
More like that.
I'm a woman, I have power.
It also relates to that you don't have any head covering.
For example, a ride?
And it's signed in the main way I've been raised.
My mother, for example, is a real basic museum.
They're praying five times a day, but the dog's just not wearing.
She always made me the faith is a clean personal thing.
It depends on everyone who interprets it.
If a man reads the Koran, he should make his own view of those things.
So when I read the Passover in the Quran, which says that God said to the prophet to hide his wives before the last air, I said to me, "I am not a prophet's wife, why should I hide me?"
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I have to get into Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the bottles are required, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
Still yes.
I've never felt so good anywhere else.
I was thinking about Polonia for a while, but I'm nice in Prague.
I'll even bring me to imagine that I'm going to educate my own kids here.
The praise is a perfect city for this.
The Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated violence.
Cossel's Fenclo's wind in Rio was called to the procedure points.
Thursday Riu de Janiero's roads in the Brazilian Rio de Janiero have sent the Czech Emperor Veronice Kozel Fenclowe.
In the Laser Radial class, it moved before the final two breakfasts to the tenth place.
That would make the Czech to make sure that it was in the final ship.
You're collecting the packages as pochemons.
They want to buy transporters.
With the idea to use already planned roads for transport, the television register Mataj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With a thought, three of them have been put into life with a different geografic achievement.
We left the National Translation in May.
At this point there are thousands of cities in it, and we'll expand the network.
In Czechland, we want to learn this first than we're moving more on the board, he says in a conversation for IDNES.cz equatorial manager.
How does the Translation work, and who can benefit from it?
You're getting her and recording it freely.
Then you can specify the road and data how much a big package you can overcome and how much you want for it.
Someone asks for transport on that day again.
When he gets the road and the time of delivery, it will be burned, and both of them will be reported.
It's gonna open a chat at the moment where two of them will agree with the transmission.
How many people would have to register to find each package his curriculum?
I don't know the perfect state, I can't see how many registered and how many roads it needs to cover the cover completely optimal and every offer covered with the request.
It's already working on the main stations, and it's a logic more easier than the way between the villages.
More people, more potential and accuracy.
People also build up confidence and find out that no one will run with the package.
You haven't had to resolve that case yet?
How many people have the service after two months after the start?
At the moment we have about five to six thousand people who create roads.
We think it's successful and we believe they'll be packed again.
Isn't it dangerous that the sender is waiting for power?
We hope that we will be competition for big conglomerates just because we are able to give things to the same day and the price break.
In the big company you'll pay for a few thousand hours for delivery.
Here you're going to pay a hundred to less, because it's the way someone's already undertaken.
Should traditional transporters be afraid of the potential residence of clients in the future?
We hope that it's going to be.
The land has a major potential, it is feeded here as a major overnational transporter, as well as a trade cycle, where all began to buy and continued to make sure the quality does not correspond to what it applies.
No one wants to find a letter in the clipboard with the message that he has an invitation to get up to the bathroom, and that's the first day after the 19th hour.
At that time, I needed a package for six hours and waited home because it was important.
We want a better, better and lowly service that makes nobody stumble and sends a competitive signal to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matthew Liška (39).
No one has ever acted in the collection of information.
Marek Greger works as a musical club manager, Mataj Liška as a TV register.
In 2014, they began to prepare the Shippancee D, which is used to transport packages already planned roads between world metropoles, especially the aircraft.
In 2015, they provided a project for the processing of the company which was created for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ChSFD.
The programme was last three quarters of the year and the market was introduced in March 2016.
Transfer applications started to develop in the last year and issued years in May.
It is the local version of Shippancee adjusted for the Czech market.
Mexican and Messic Profi applications developed from January and accessed to members at the end of July 2016.
The purpose was from the beginning to do all these areas that one day connect to one.
In Czechland they want to carry out and then, in collaboration with a strong investor, more focus on the world market.
The shared economy is the last time the subject and this is the service of type AirBnB or Ubera.
You don't have anxieties about the action in ́a, which no one can even say too much where the share border is and where the economy goes?
It's the same thing, if it's a different product.
We are thinking that if it's successful and we'll go up with this, we'll be the next train in the eye through the green economy.
But although someone is shooting and working, it is not intended to carry out financial authorities and tax controls.
Each holder, on the one or on the other side, will be invited to give his receipt if he does it.
What do you think the service has so big potential?
The sender makes the door and the carrier wins, and the road costs are respectively reduced.
This is the strong idea that connects interest in both sides.
At the time of the social networks that people share, they wanted to join this.
They can produce beautiful stories, people have the joy of helping somebody, and they will tell them about it.
Maybe someone brings you forgotten brilliants, keys or pieces.
People, according to my longer time, missing personal access, we say this is the service of people.
So how do you make sure that the kitchen doesn't break the package?
Each holder with the registration shall provide a civil proof and shall introduce a bank of connections, payments or credit cards.
These are the channels that give service to the service and to man's equality.
The curriculums also collect stars based on the evaluation of the senders.
We'll offer security, we're still shiping details.
For an unsecured insurance in case of loss or damage, the curriculum shall not receive the responsibility for the contents of the criminal right, if there is something inside against law and does not know about it.
The police will stop him and find him in a closed packet in his cow of self-palm or ten pounds of hashish, the criminal responsibility of the sender.
Does it not threaten the use of sensitive data from the database?
The registrations are, if necessary, a supervisory administration authority, which will be able to view it as one, and we are not able to see it, data are protected against deficiency.
How much money will get after successful delivery of a carrier in the hand?
The curriculum determines the price and gets the whole amount he's talking about.
The sender shall also calculate a few percent of the contact.
These money are our winning, but it's just a few percent, because we want to press the volume.
The curriculum cannot also be accused that it has not been added when it has delivered it, the overtake and the delivery is verified by QR codes.
Are they restrictions?
What about the size or volume of the package?
You can do anything.
We've got three sizes, a little like a bottle, a middle like a bullet and a big bever.
Then there's no more restrictions, and if anyone's in the car, he's transferring the lingerie.
Plus the sender has the possibility to photograph the package, so the kid's seeing what he wants.
You don't even have to packet if you don't want to hide the contents.
It's my kidnapped, you're putting the kitchen in your hand, and it's it.
Who came with a idea, and how did the service continue to be released?
Friend got a idea for more than two years ago, then I didn't know it very much.
Then he showed me a demo with a supernatural arrival that is mainly targeting a traveling aircraft.
At that moment, I told him that I'd look for a investor, but I'd like to stand and put it in an effort.
The next year was developed before we found the Shippancee firm in London for more creditability of the whole product.
But this is not the version you're focusing on now.
No, the marketing went on to Czechland, where we're trying to get out, because it all had birth pain, and it's still what to solve and improve.
We are trying to react to the return connection from the clients and the market on the currently not solve so much.
We know that it's a time for a trace, but we don't get, we want to create a good product for people.
Shippancee D was the basic and lovingest, other two were their way of upgrading.
The transport came when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that we at least learned in Czech.
The third of the Messianic is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and to the second end of the world.
It functions for senders as well as the Transfer, but the division is that you see in it as a curriculum in the form of points on the map that are closer to you, thanks to the geolocator in the mobile.
Applications for curriers who want to live in this way, we called the Messianic Profi.
So somebody can make it clear that he's going to get out of the town?
That's exactly, the last one's going to get in Prague a taxiker, a student, a mother to a family permit, someone who wants to get a travel to work.
Like all of them are stupid now, so this can be totally the same.
The man sees where there are prohibitions, comes to it, clicks and sees when it is to be handed and transfers.
It's fixed more leather than competitive services.
At this moment, we are doing more web interfaces that will be traveling to the companies to send a lot, to fill data on them, whether they will create points on the map.
Then we are able to use their service for each month.
Are you currently engaged in the project?
It tries to us, but we have it normally in employment, and the project could enjoy and develop.
It doesn't hide us a strong supernational investor, we're two boys of whom one had a genial idea, and the other joined it with other enterprises and ideas.
Now we are looking for the investor quite strong enough to be able to cook with us not the Czech market, but that should go with us to the world product and become another important market player like AirBnB and Uber.
The Titanfall 2 is to bring a sorrow of the forgotten pest.
This makes the second part and only the game in it will be based on the first information more pepper than in Call of Duty.
The length will be moved about eight hours and the full must be exited just from the capture of a network integration in the first section.
It is therefore possible to rejoice in the freedom of movement, which includes the opportunity to use a war titan.
Besides the share passports, the game will also include the level of delayed right to turnover movement.
They're going to take the tables and include rebuses.
To their conviction, therefore, there are a basic example of double springs, running by walls and lane clues.
Sometimes, it will also be necessary to eliminate the enemies.
They miss the maps of the blue and level with special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to set the tables and close the potential door.
You're going to be a shadow of fighting.
The time of the game should be accommodated between the surrounding action and the quietest moments to examine the unknown planet.
We're going to play for Jack Cooper's song, we're playing about the pilot career.
Cooper at the beginning of the campaign, together with Lastimos's playing on the foreign planet Typehon, both of the enemy soldiers.
And he's coming to him, and he's not a dark whisper.
Moreover, the lastimosis at the havary has a mortality, and Cooper will therefore receive the task to carry out the titans.
His dream about the pilot career will be fulfilled so before he expected.
By step, but the battery's needed for robots.
They'll be significant to Cooper's talks with Titan.
The players serve as a source of information on military past, however, workers' personal communications will result in humoral moments.
For example, when Titan is going to call out all the hurts that threaten Cooper on the planned exhibition.
The information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought a Polygon server.
Moreover, the result will be possible to judge in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first record of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 comes on October 28, which is for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark is alive, but the exhibition of p's remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes the name to THQ Nordic.
In 2013, the THQ publisher received a number of his marks and the right to use the log and the name of the company.
Nordic thanks to this, for example, Darxiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or Package Red Faction Collection.
Moreover, for the issuers, there are 23 hers and 13 of them are not yet discovered.
Thirty years ago, when I went to the department, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor, about 20 years ago.
I've tried it from the beginning - first of the time she was trying longer, and then they're getting income.
It's a big guy, like her type, because she walked with a similar one before me.
She's totally crazy.
In the first days, she even changed her voice, she had such a girl, a loved voice.
But when I told her I know what happened, she stopped it.
But I've seen it all.
Then he walked regularly from work to half fourth, and so she left three to purchase.
Every day she tried to see him at least.
After I've come to see they're in the barcake, in the workshop.
A few times I thought they were right there.
I watched the keys, he was determined to accept them there.
But I don't know why, finally, I've been sitting at home.
I've never been able to go there, to make that determined step.
Maybe you're going to smile me, but I believe that my wife has controlled me.
I think soon she tried to do what she wants.
And I did it.
Maybe I'm just a little bitch.
In time, my neighbors indicated me that he knew it.
I was so stupid that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it was all the way, so it'd be bad.
That it's going to be in the family, something was just a daughter.
So I've rejected it, go on and go.
But once I went after him to the apartment that I needed something to help.
He went with me and I told him I got anonymous to meet my wife, and he witnessed it all.
I asked him what he would tell me about it.
He stood there, cried out his arms, looked into the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then, at that time, I met his wife on the road from the business.
I told her, but she didn't believe it.
No Jacques reacted to it, and she didn't tell me anything.
No one told me anything at that time.
I'm a man who never walked too much, who has a problem to meet someone so to find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I still agreed that it would end one day.
I said I'd forgive it all, and life's going on.
But it wasn't.
And I've never seen all of this in reality.
I have it in my own tonight.
I've given her too often, but I've finally left it for quietness.
He's still living in the neighborhood and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife to my master.
She's done everything at the house. She's got a wallet, a bowl, a bullet.
She's working.
I always thought she was trying to do something else.
And it's gonna be said she's nice.
But sometimes I'd like to see her, cover her, and she doesn't leave her.
We together go to the trip and purchase, and everyone thinks how happy we have married.
But she ever told me she never loved me.
That she had me, and she's got me, but she didn't love me.
And I see he loves him today, it's her god.
And I don't have such a life.
When it started, and I took it very bad, I told her one time I didn't want to live and asked me what she would say to it if I had done it.
I wanted to say if she agreed or didn't.
And I wanted to hear that from her, yes or not.
But she thought, and finally said, "But there's enough place here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to build a new French islamic creation that should serve as a pool between the state and his Muslims.
After terrorist attacks, France graduates the fight against radical islamists and helps the calling government and local Muslim minority.
"When the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who distort public freedom, it will be more difficult for France to ensure the freedom of their recognition," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
This is a pleasure to ensure that only the spirit of education in France is preached in the country.
It also wants to stop the financing of the mixture, when the publishers often join with money by giga.
In October, the Prime Minister Valls wants to build a new French islamic idea to serve as a pool between the state and his Muslims.
The new institution will replace the current French institution for islams, which was established by the Dominique de Villepin president in 2005.
It had already been to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mixtures and countries that finance their exhibition.
But soon, it was in the internal divorce, and it never worked hardly.
"It's a complete failure," stated Valls.
In the head of the new opinion, it is obvious that the former minister of the inside and the defence of Jean-Pierre Chevenement, known as a representative of the secondary state.
In France, a mixture of 2500 mixtures and prayers, some 120 of them serves radical islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities from the country have visited a number of 80 islamic spirituals and have been considered in addition to several decades.
This week, the German police also faced the gyhadist spirit.
The Islamians were given the fight for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space, where the electrons were particularly radicalized and attacked on the Sichem temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate on a new institution was deployed in France, which would replace the non-substitute.
All have succeeded further terrorist attacks that have been conducted radical islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new position will have two main tasks - to ensure financing of mixture from household resources and to monitor immigrants.
But there is no longer where it gets funds, although it is considered a few of us.
One of them is a special payment for food hallah, therefore, especially for the meat which is deceived from the damage in accordance with the Islamic Principles.
This tax would be paid by the sellers in practice for eating, and it would be for granting authorisation.
The part of the money would then just travel into the budget of the investment.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French candidates who are released to Mekka.
Each year, for traditional village to Saudi Arabia, they will release about 30 thousand from France.
Moreover, in French mixtures, only the publishers who have passed by educational programmes at dark universities should be affected.
Their preaching should therefore be in accordance with democracy.
The government also closes radical mixtures.
"We've closed them twenty and the other will follow," Mr Bernard Cazeneve said.
"In France there is no place for those who report hate and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His former wife was hard to hurt an unknown shooter on Friday afternoon in the Company Centre in Northern Spanish Zaragoz, writes the Inde's journal.
The shooting came after the woman and her daughter left the Garage Chambers in their car.
The man was waiting in the car before the middle, where he also started to shoot.
According to the witnesses, the man turned the gun against himself, writes Indian.
She brought her to the hospital an unfornicated daughter, for men in a critical state, she had to take a healthy.
It was about 11.00 a.m. in the central metropole autonomy of Aragonia, near local university.
With a revocation to the Spanish Agency Europe Press, India says that the motive was probably a recent divorce of both partners.
We're waking with a cross, we're waking rows, divorce, and chi's cockpit.
The year wants easily, well-feeding foods, only because we are the Czech Republics and we have our holidays and our heads.
And then, from the airports, the grilled crown, the boat, the wheel's horse.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too easy, even so sometimes with the exception of the salat or coated greenine.
True, grilling is difficult for time and holidays, it is also a community business, and no one needs to be closed in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make good understanding, which special chairing, their preparation represents a small ritual, however, there is no longer to exhaust, pect, smooth or soul.
And they will contribute to our health.
Whatever it is needed for home sushi or sashimi, where quality surfaces and a few well-obtained griffs will make it a pleasure and eat a single real exotic light.
Like even easier roles in the rise paper from today's receipt.
It even falls down in timely more spectacular freshness and rice breakdown.
The paper is just allowed for a moment to mix into water, and then it is only about the fantasy of the kitchen, how it wants to play with full and supplies.
It's not like a rain.
A number of foods of Asian kitchens today is also the fact that the surfaces are already currently available.
Increasingly coated sweet oxide dish, which is one of the basic cups of sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the right red gari has a sign of a single picking island and like a nice silence thanks to a secret receptor, according to which it mixes from some species of eye and mirror.
Therefore, it is sufficient to buy a sample that corresponds to the size, and the Annex with indicative antibacteria, which supports trailing and divergence against cattle or crash, is ready.
Banan lists.
It is used, in particular, in Buddhist and Hindu cultures, in the conservation and dilution of foods in the most different occasions of celebration and rituals.
The long-sized bananoblads are very expanded in many Asia and South America as a "help" for the preparation of the most variety of fresh, fresh and frozen foods, which are covered in them as the alobal.
The Banan magazine, then, also provides a specific advice.
We're allowed to buy in sales with exotic fruit and green, even before they've been cut into the face.
However, select only green, and then healthy - unseen and without bleeding.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salat from a row of waking, sesame and sesame oil.
He's going to buy a refrigerator.
Whoever often eats or prepares sushi will probably know, in particular, a series of nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of maritime rounds, which produces by sushing, lising and smoking such nori lists, which are thus designed for the production of sushi.
Wakame − dark green rain growing in waters around the island of Hokkaido  – also fresh and sucked, and is similar to the race of nori.
Notwithstanding who doesn't know the middle of a vacame, the Asian women are obviously using it for the relief for birth after birth.
And all of this, this row has too wonderful.
Clear blood, strengthening the crew of the rounds, even evidently prohibiting the heavy hair and the character of the mineral substances.
Sustained and dissolved vacame also serves as roots, for example to protect the rise.
The pure rows are first allowed to listen in the water, then they're black, put into the woman's water, and a half minute is covered.
Then they are hungry in the ice water, the middle of the jabbers and continue to be adapted, perhaps as a favorite salat.
But to buy her ready, dead, it's the most simple solution.
Thus, it is only to play a role with easily grainful, slightly and easy, full of healthy distress.
That's a bomb forever.
You're not going to get a grilled boat anymore.
Eat healthy, easy and ago.
The Assyrians are thinking about it.
It's enough for a few special sugars and a bit of weight, and you have interesting fresh food that slowly combines cut.
And it's ready once two.
Four cows of rise paper, 40 g darkness, 40 g white row, 100 g green cross, 60 g salat boxes, 60 g rows of waking and 60 g sweet chi cups.
The wheel of the sequential coriandra, the black sesame bed, the chi-shirts beds, 20 g manga and 40 g of the covered gari, a few pini-shirts.
First we'll prepare the sticks.
We're putting the rise paper on five seconds into the white water.
Then let's get her out and wait when she gets out.
Meanwhile, in bitter water, we'll quickly turn the Christian exhausts, we'll put them in the ice water so that they don't lose the color.
We'll put a full of greenine on the authorised paper and packaging it.
We will completely prepare from white lines, darkness and salat screens that we're putting on the rocks, we'll smile them with the sweet chi's cup, add a sequential coriander, we're just mixing and put it on the rose paper.
In the banany, we put the Christian exhibitions, add the bullets and finally add the whole food to a row of waves, which are set up by the mirror, the manga's plaque, the black seat, and add a couple of pine-bounds.
British must be satisfied with silver in the seventh rugby, the choice of Fidži bears gold
In the seventh ragby, the prominent performance of the Great Britain ended a devastated stage on the last prejudice, Fidji struck in the final department on Thursday evening British dinner at the Deidoro stadion here in Riu, highly 43:7.
The Fidjans preached mysterious lessons in the processing, sticks, movements, supporting games, running to the lake and brutal forces - and they obtained gold, their first olympical medails at all.
The poverty came with an unexpected price of comfort in the form of silver medails - for British third day - and the British could be on their performances in the inhibiting olympical tournament of the seventh ragby healed, attacked the New Zealand, Argentina and Jihoaf Republic.
The semi-free winning over the South African 7:5 in the same day, maybe it was dead in the final.
Of course, Fiji would also hurt a 15-year-old team in full health.
Of course, it is for British, even though they are comforting, but they can be glad that at least one of them will have tomorrow around the golden medail: the main Fidjan's shot is Ben Ryan, the former boss of England in Wimbledon.
The Great Britain has hurt the street.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every stock in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This hurt is painful, but the progress is inappropriate.
Fiji started with a lot, the British britains reflected for joy.
Toma Mitchell and the rest of the partners, it was like running for a number of buses in the movement and the world's shampionians were about 5:0, when Osea Kolinisau was broken outside the corner.
The timetime showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added further to the right chair from which the conversion was.
12:0 and the British touching the sword.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the great Leon Nakaraw and protect him from cutting the depth, but only Fidjana was quiet.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua touched the right corner and the Brits played 17:0.
Nakarawa added after returning, and in hours there remained more than one minute... from the first half.
Then Vatemo Rava passed through the small British and joined the ship where he was cut.
After conversion to status 29:0, she followed a break.
It was like Fiji was born for ragby 7s while the Brits were still transferred.
That's exactly like that.
Britains have made a middle change and the force of Fidjans stopped... for a long four-minute, which was good in comparison with the first half-time until the brilliant between Fiji Joshua Tuis went on.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British, cut to touchdown in the left corner to increase in 36:7. But a long time the people of the Pacific Islands won, and their fans sing on the coasts, having the balls and dancing.
It was hard not to surprise the totally disgraced approach of Fidjan.
At the final moments, Mata Viliame was still insulted by the next trial of Fidjan's winning.
The journalist was called, the Fidjans were thrown up and the Brits fell on the throat.
Before the same day, Fiji in semifiral struck Japan 20:5 and the Great Britain had the Jihoaf’s Republic in a slight semifinale - to the division of a conference.
Kyle Brown received the South African first half-time leadership, but Dan Norton, grateful to his feet, broke the defense line and cut the second half-time under the hair.
The great late Marcuse Watson, brother of Anthony from the 15th team of England, ensuring victory - and finally silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning for the victory in the asterotic festival inspired the fight of a trainer with cancer
You don't find more emotional gold on these Games - and that's what to say.
From the first summary to the last, during the 220 penalties in the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance at their golden moment at Stacio de Lagoa.
Even when they were sitting at the joy of two, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship was walking over the ship to meet the second Olympian gold behind her in the bathroom of two women, there was still a voice of a present trainer Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of the British sport that had reached such a result.
Their overcome was absolute, in general it was their 39th commitment, where they remained unfaithful.
What we see - two exciting atlets, as the water level flys with the elegantic lab -- does not reflect the weight of winning completely.
For every golden medail from the cup, the batalion of the hands of helpers, which mean the cup after the cup, and no hands were helpful more than the trainer's hands who didn't know whether this day would be when he was found in cancer.
According to his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered the cancer of the potential mixture that can be operated, and I've done this operation.
Without operation, anything could happen.
It would be very bad.
Sometimes it changes your view of things.
The cancer was found to Williams in 2013.
I'm glad for the whole three, it was that he could stop the treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside of me, and then reduce the accident to the minimum - if so we can call it in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to give myself to the income.
It was to lift up.
I was in the hospital and I walked after the room - 20 degrees, 30 degrees, 50 degrees at the time they said that a few steps are enough.
That's how it started.
It's a way to vote about itself, but this was something more important.
Without a sense of victory, their first thoughts of Williams, who was very nervous, spoke less than the habit of trying to make his own insults.
Stanning, a pool of the king's workshop, who has a mission in Aghanisthan, said: "This week I was with emotions on the day, maybe it's a little extreme, but it's so powerful."
It again highlights how much it means for me how much we worked with Helen and Robin too.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin until now.
Without Robin, they weren't anybody, so he belonged to a big thanks, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't want a better man for a train or a better kitchen.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose the only trial for five years.
Two of them had a threatening rytme that their rivals couldn't be equipped.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the debts from New Zealand and Denmark began to be closed, Stanning with Glover had a very large reserve.
We've been focused at the moment.
Helen cried, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to let it go.
We had a good start, and we didn't have to reach anything else.
We didn't enjoy today's firewall, we just wanted to celebrate well, go out and win the truck that happened to us.
We'll take two of us a year to think before they decide what's going on.
Glover is given the next week, and it's a television welfare of Steva Backshall.
Now he wants to get out of the moment.
I didn't mean that it would be my last trip.
That would mean too big pressure.
It was about six months in London before they found that I was a olympian champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
This was about four minutes.
I have a lot of better feelings," she said.

Prison?
Instead of carrying people free, he says the taximfie Rubes to the overbreak.
Six taxi officers and former officers in Prague are, as the TT has introduced, excuses.
You have reached a number of reporters in which you have discovered subwater practices and those who have to be in a group that will occur before the court.
You've learned a few unfair trips with discovered actors.
How much is the report of the members of the organized group's charge for you?
I was waiting for a judge to come.
I'm primarily aware of the judgment.
I don't think they should be in service.
It's nothing.
Firstly, they should return all the covered money.
And they should return them so they're going to drive all people free.
It's sometimes a suitable solution.
So, does that mean that you don't have the case of an offence as sufficient?
It's enough for me that some of them have such fear that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes pinglas, another spreads the pizz, and one has completely gone to it.
Injuries can be theoretically obtained by two to eight years of procedure.
Do you think it's a suitable rate?
I generally have a problem with freedom.
I think it's a bad crime.
Closing someone's office, especially in such a case, it's an insensitive.
Such people should return to the company they took.
Through the fourth century, our country had destroyed the name and just stolen people.
So let them now do a good visit and consider people free.
I can't imagine that else.
It would work as publicly successful work.
As somebody goes to collect a waste, they would get a car and freely carry people after Praise.
No, I really think they'll finally get a submin and it'll be one of them.
They're going to find another way to undergo somewhere.
He studied at Miroslava Ondrikka in Piska and then at the University of Tomas Bati in Zlina.
It belongs to people who started in the Czech Republic with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
It works as a editor for the Internet TV Stream.cz, where it is shared in a series of orders, now prepares the Prague Guide order, which is designed by primarily age.
These Rubes, in the form of short reporters, advises what services in Prague should be avoided and what it recommends without worry to use.
Earlier he took a series of names How to this, City of Underwaters?, Life in Luxus, A enough! and Praha vs. Prague.
Unfortunately, they are talking about them as a organized group.
The police watched her for a few months.
Can such subwater taxic network be marked by mafia?
They're so disgusting mafians, not as we know from Kmotra.
It's more about mafians - June, but the organizations are sure.
Only in keeping stafly each other.
The powder's totally spread.
I followed that, for example, the main exhibition has no way with Paris, Paris has no more abilities with taxikers waiting at Karl's Lázní (disco club)
Everyone guards his place and every group is just organized.
It's obviously a network.
But the accused are only seven people, six taxi officers, and one ex-master officer, which the driver warned against controls.
As you're saying, the accidents haven't disappeared from the street.
What is the percentage of the tax tax tax offices in your department?
It's a very small percent.
The worst ones are still on the street.
For example, I'm talking about Alesha Rijack.
It's a man who is dangerous - in his car, he drives a telescopic cow, and every Sunday and Sabbath stands at Karl's pool and drives people.
When I finally went with him, he wanted me to follow seven hundred in three miles.
His police didn't stop.
They just chose a few people from all that great group.
The same is, however, in other places of Prague.
Thus, the seven people’s deceit will be hard to dismiss a fashioned praise, which is evidently much more degree.
Of course it's not for nothing.
It's gonna help, but all evil doesn't move, it's true.
Is taxi officers who acquire the tourists still in the same places you showed in the reports, then at Karl's most, or in Paris's street?
Yeah, exactly.
These places stand every day and every day the votes are distorted.
He's ignoring it as the city police, so the Prague Magazine.
It's not any cocourks anymore, but it's a perfect delicateness.
Business of praise taxikers in numbers
Yet, some of them, if it's only a part of the group, will get before the court.
It's a middle.
So I have to ask, do you feel satisfying?
If I'd take it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong because it was my goal, it's gonna be and it'll be to improve the Prague center.
And even if I feel that it's needed to be a little better, I'll continue in it.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last evil remains there, they should still do something for it, and they removed it.
They can't be satisfied with that.
But it's not so, it's of course more.
You're still trying to count them right in taxi?
Sometimes I'm doing the testing boxes and I have to say that it's still bad.
I just got a taxiker outside the same group last week, and he was very surprised that he saw me again.
He counted 560 corners in three miles, although he then claimed that it was about 56 corners (used a trick with a decimal line).
He's got on it, the cops arrived, and this taxiker was so disrupted the wood that he was still following those police officers and asked them when someone finally gives him those 56 corners.
Like a case.
The taxamet tax collected a decimal piece and roaded tourists with 357 corners.
It's said that the distress of subwater taxikers hasn't gone after you showed the faces of those who used an insensitive amount for a short road?
They're still incredible.
How did that happen to the taxiker who had 56 corners?
The police sent him away with that they couldn't talk to him at the place because he made a ticket.
And that will be a problem, I think, even at the court (six taxikers and one exhaustor).
On the one hand, there will be a taxi officer with his tenants, on the other side of the police.
However, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate should not use the secret records from the tax service vehicle as a evidence in the court.
When I took parts of their subways, the taxi officers warned me on this precedens.
I'm a record, but I just wanted to use the reporter.
Are you sure that this ability could protect it from the court?
I hope every judge would understand that no taxiker could drive six or ten corners per mil, because he wouldn't live.
You were talking about a trick with a decimal line that is especially before the clients of the underwater taxikers.
Is it still current, or is it anxious to use this fig after your reporters have published?
I think we've made this trick in order to exhibit the order.
Recently, I went with a taximan, he praised me that he was the honest taxiker.
Then I noticed that the taxmater's bearing the black leather.
When I asked him what he had, he said, "You know what it is."
If taxi-masters haven't worked too much, can they be warned about the court with their colleagues?
Is there something that can be released from underwaters?
You've been talking about the way you think they're going to find it.
I think it can't do anything.
But someone can get you out of those places.
And these are the fair taxi officers who should work more than to get them out of there seriously.
From my experience, I have to say that these fair taxikers in Prague are lucky.
But do they want to go against those who show the story of their services?
It's good, but they're missing mind.
He can't go too much, and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they arranged this demonstration (for us to a total limitation of the Adrian Krnacz's accommodation office), they did not mean the power they actually wanted.
Once they said that they did not test Ubera that they just wanted to have the same subminans as I just had this service, then they said that they wanted more than Uber.
It was so that they just locked Prague and came out of that only the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you generally appreciate the access of the Prague Master in the solution to the problem with the prejudice of a cruel?
It's to see that she had to go into that until the criminal police had to solve something.
The Magister was short for that.
They had a box that made information that means that the taxi division had done their job for a few years completely unexpected.
I hope that the officers can comply with all dismissed controls to know what he did.
That's the worst thing to me.
I even was with him on one control chain, which I tried to be afterwards from their description.
The last parts of the series have been published for several months.
What's the answer?
I mean, primarily, in the forests, than the series is the most attached.
When I've always got friends from the box, I'll give them the video.
And then, when we go to the Antiquity Place, they're surprised that the same people who see on the bars are seriously standing there.
Unhealthy the praitic celebrity.
But seriously.
I'd put the floor around them to look at them.
Museum of communism right on the street.
My latest question is.
You're taking a taxi when you're doing?
Sure.
I'm running the services that I don't have to pay, but the card.
I'm using services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no option of subway.
But there's a lot of disappointments that are fair.
I just took a taxi on the street since that time.
The driver said, "Yes, you have a courage."
Bem in the translator for the Italian tourist.
The subwater practices of taxikers have been written in 2005.
Some recipients Paul Bem in the same year expressed a control chain in the overlapping of the Italian tourist and immediately at the first trial of the driver was deceived by two hundred.
But the editor Rubes had worse experience.
The taxis officers were charged for a carrier from the Old House to Vaclav 820 corners, which resulted in 195 corners per kilometre, as the reporters were calculated.
Instead, the Prague Magazine fixed the maximum price for 28 corners per mil.
There are also further surprising sums in the road reports: for example, a two - kilometer road from Paris to Truhlaria's tourist 400 corners.
The dear jewels also offered taxickers waiting at Karlovo's pool.
To go to the Angel, which has 2,5 miles [2,5 km], they have six hundred crowns.
Mramor's mixed with a pretty clean water, the most without chemical and what longer, better.
The uncleannesses of the world are going well, although sometimes the slip has to be put down by the scalpel, it is necessary to get it out of the moves.
It's not easy and it's not easy, it's not going to be closed to his work at Vanessa Trost's restaurant from Oldrzych's in Haj.
Cloud down before it: the sepulchre is conceived by the laughing, which must be unnumbered, and again the following.
"The restorator should be careful, patient and unrelated for the work of §," she concluded.
It's not far from her first restaurant work at Fridland.
Thanks to her, for example, the stone elements of the fascist in the back-track of the Friedland Council, restored also the sockets of the Saint Marie Magdalena in Zatişer, the Saint Jane Nemuck in Friedlanta, Pieta in the Friedland Circuit Street, the Marian Column in Friedlant or the Atlantic in the front of the lake in the New City.
With the rebuilt of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine from Rederna, they began in 2011.
Now the surface of stone elements is cleaned from uncleanness and cross, released by stone parts shall be assured against the fall and movement; or they shall be cast into the wall or to each other.
Waiting is the same treatment and the conservation of the surface.
The records on the game will be re-flighted.
"Therefore, it is started by throwing the records on the marmor boards with silver gold," reported the Reporter of the State Memorial Care of the Civil Agency in Frydlant Vera Sabbath.
In the past, there are no records of the fact that the removal would be in the same way.
In a closer view, the interested opens in the marmor columns will be opened.
They're hundreds of years old, and it's about the rest of the spring.
He was richly embraced, despite the arrival of Sweden for the Thirty-year war, all disappeared.
The word of the sepulchre was opened, she noticed the Sabbath.
In the Castle Finding of the Holy Cross, restaurants with a quiet surface as home.
After the vacation in 2010, there was a need to get into the order of the burst that was felt under the water, restored the baptized baptism, the seeding malves in the grave and now the funeral.
"They're glad that they'd also go into the victory in the future," the Sabbath caused.
The church is different in a very good state, each year in the maintenance and we put money in.
Auroratory work on the re-reserve will come at a total of 128 thousand corners.
They will be borrowed from the station, the city in this part of the renewment will put any money in.
Hundred thousand crowns will just come from the play in the National Country of History City in 2015, and thereafter 28 thousand crowns are the contributions of the Ministry of Culture, awarded the officer of Frydlant Dan Ramzer.
Representativity has decided to be released to the repository restaurant.
The opinions of experts on the future development on the selected foreign markets followed by indexing and comparison with the Czech market (PX) at the horizont of one month and a half of the year.
On the markets, the low phone calls and growth.
Who would say that at the beginning of the year.
The American Index S&P500, which has passed 12% of the correction in February, is today in a new history maximum and has already been added 7% from the beginning of the year.
This is a reaffirmation of the railway rule that businessmen should never be against the interest of the central banks that have finally reached their own.
In the case of the American activity on the historical maximum as much as the callatility mixture is currently less than 2014, when the markets were satisfied and without fear increased thanks to the quantitative release of the American Central Bank and when it was steady under 12 per cent as today's volatility index (VIX).
And not too.
Although the Fed market continues to be prepared for a progressive increase in rates, the quantitative release in Europe and in Japan has been complete and has been added to the work last week to the Bank of England, which will buy debt for 70 billion years in the next six months.
The new quantity release wheel is therefore pressing so lower and contributes to the total elimination of risks and fears from the future.
How will this state be maintained?
That's, of course, a question for a million.
For monitoring, however, there are no risks currently, the world economy is at the same time a constant growth without the costs, the commodity market rates and in China are stabilised and breathed, so they may not have too wondered if the American action continued in a similar quiet regime.
It's damn that Juncker doesn't study Klause!
I'm very nice that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and important task.
I wanted to make this possible for the work of the experienced policy, the leader of the European Commission Juncker, when the French policy (really experienced, because it was so different by the overnational policies that the best example of the European Elite, named the main negotiator of the European Commission from the EU.
Juncker's election showed signs that the EU's serious interest is to seek the form of future friendship coexistence with British.
However, the British media adopted the name of Barnier as Juncker's military act.
Barnier is a European federalist's scale.
Great British hates.
As the Euro Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014) was concerned with the reform of the European Banking Rights.
He took her as he could only take her: the closed enemy of the English capture of the free market and the model of capitalism.
The multilateral regulatory station was together with the concept of the Bank of the Union, and it was in front of all that originated from the London financial centre of City, which has made the legislation to overcome strong regulations of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, representative of Paris in contrast with London, will be a strong, inflammable and obviously also an independent negotiator.
It's not a good news.
How to not mention the peaceful and friendly division of the Czech Republic, which has contributed to so many developments, reviews and empaties of Václava Klause Prime Minister.
That is why the Czechs today can be the closest friends and associates.
It's damn that Juncker from Václav Klause, at least in this, didn't learn.
It would be good for everyone!
Landscape around Putina?
The ruler of Kreml left his nearby Ivanov.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin left Sergei Ivanov on Friday from the head of the presidential office.
It's his place to take Anton Vayno.
She informed the Russian media about it with a refusal to notify the Kremla print service.
Instead, Putin indicated that Ivan would leave his own request.
At the meeting that was transferred by the Rossia 24 TV station, the Chairman said that he was going to meet Ivanov's desire when he arrived in that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office at least four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for environment and transport.
The report on the exchange in the head of the President's administration, which Ivano's subsequent representative of Vajno now, is considered to be relatively surprised.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is named as one of the nearest co-operation of Putina.
For example, this former KGB officer in the past placed the Minister of Defence and the president of the Government.
Now they will leave the staff of the President's Security Council.
But Ivan at the meeting with Putin indicated that the long detention in the head of the Governing Boss of the State is actually a recordman.
He held in her four years and eight months.
In this regard, he recalled that in 25 years since its establishment, 11 people had already been concentrated in this area.
Kvites or debrists of Stryc won't play a fineal.
Even one of the fifth tennis forces could not be changed in the final.
As the first of his battle, Peter Kvit spent, which conformed to the Portuguese surprise of Monice Puig after sevens 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
The Czech Debrists also followed the white after a minute with the Grid.
Although the overseers of Williams’ sisters in the first sect were shot after the fucking, however, two sets were married, and the Russians finally used hundreds in a rotated game.
Two hundred then were lost by 4:6.
Polar success in the next program in Riu'manalo of the Czech Employment: Skipper Ondraj Sinek won his semifinale when the second Damira Martina from Croatia even after the release in the end for a second.
Today, the submins were great, the wind was calm.
I was trying to watch the most, he brought the Son.
It's his companions to the department, they had to fight against the procedure.
So they've taken the same power, it could be easier tomorrow.
But I don't say it's going to be easy, it's just playing in my caret, and the cousin of the Prague Dukly.
Topink-button's peace, but she didn't run in Snyk's blinds.
The fifty-year-old monarch conceived the fourth position of the semifinal today in her wheel and expected her to start in B final and fight at 7 to 12 places.
The gold from London isn't so cool.
I didn't go to the final first on the olympy.
It hates me a little, but on the other hand, I took a quality instruction and gave everything that happened.
The companions were just better, Topink's button was declined before them.
She was fighting until the end and believed that her fourth games between the elite six would be found.
The battle was too close to the goal.
I knew the girls were equipped that any of the field could be punished.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could get to the final.
Unfortunately, this day was a lifetime, said the world’s mystery of 2011.
Nepechal, a young shooter Philip Nepechal, who couldn't even have been able to get out of the ability this time in bed.
Nepech was in the 33th place.
The best qualification came out to the Russian.
From the first point, Sergej Kamenskii had 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorian (628,9).
The non-peichal seed had a value of 620.5 point.
The atlets also spoke first in the Rio program, including the Czech Seven-Boyers, Catherine Cach and Elisk Klučin.
Cachs belong to the second discipline of the olympical competition on the eleventh place, the Czech Recordman Elisk Klučin's twenty-fourth.
It leads Britka Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who hopped to the height of 198 meters as the second of Nafissatu Thomova.
Both were concerned about the history of the best higher performance of the seventh.
They tried to hopp up 201 meters, but they did not.
German, Russia, who's worse?
When we turn away from absurdity, the following questions: The German company has passed the deep seberflexy, where the Russian is nowhere.
In both the large Eurasian nations, dictators appeared in the 20th century, and the power of the regimes which were Neid, brutal and terrible.
The Russian Bolshevics, from 1917 to 1989, have contributed to 94 million of communism victims, which introduce the Black Book to the communism, whether it should be an individual repression, targeted by hunger, incompetenced war or non-idic experiments.
In the Nazis, some 6 million Jews have destroyed in a way, and the total victims of the Second World War are deceived by 60 million.
The Germans and the Soviets were conducted in the occupied or abandoned territory.
In Germany or SSSR, there were no only few individuals, but a large part of the people had been able to make these crimes active, passively or only by shaking the head into the sand.
It's not the specificity of these nations, we're Czech too guilty.
In Germany, the denunciation came without the end of the war, the Court of Norimber.
The most important, however, has arrived.
When the children were growing, they began to ask, ‘ Daddy, my grandfather, why did you make such animals?
How could you do that!
This brought a reflection and treatment to the company.
German elites have been added primarily to the prosperity of the country, to remove poverty, to welcome their citizens.
Now there are other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they are not going to join it back to Alsasko-Lottery or anyone - to revanch - military attack - it may be recognizing everyone.
After the dead studed war in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of potential positive changes was definitively closed at the overburn of the thousands of years when an ex-KGB (sic!)Vladimir Putin has reached the potential.
The crime past is often celebrated today in Russia.
Rusland's roadway is a revanch, a lost territory, a degradation of the West.
health, prosperity and the future of your own people is not a value for the adversity.
They'll be afraid of their own, and the strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that this is only the decades of the despotal regime that the Russians are not genetic or culturally minor - intended to the Asian (see) Tyrania.
Who's going to sing growth around Krym?
Ukrainian Army.
In the last days and hours, the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Chrym was deteriorated.
Who's going to sing to grow up?
After a longer period of relative tranquillity, the relations between Ukraine and Russia returned to further deterioration.
The Ucrainian side was the middle of Krym, which was joined to Russia over two years ago and was part of its territory.
The reports from both endeavored parties are obviously opposed and it is difficult to verify them independently, and so we have only the possibility to think about an oldly known question to whom it is to say?
According to the reports from Moscow, the terrorist attacks on Chrym from the Ukraine side, which, in fact, refuses Ukraine and complains Kreml from the operation.
The information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units in the territory of Russia has already come from the case of Savchenk's pilot response that they were obviously taken in Russia's territory.
They approached the Ukrainian version, in which Russia would contribute to a deterioration around Krym?
The simple answer sounds: in nothing.
Escalation presses around Krym can only damage Russia, mainly from the West, in the form of further sanctions and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, the immigration crisis in Europe has reached attention to Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost a total credit before its residents when the current support by the President of Poroshenka is moved about 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have been banking for a long time not to be nice financial injections from the EU and mainly MMF.
In this case, the Ukrainian regime will repeat the attention to its country so that he will strengthen its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve the renownedness before the electors in his country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leading of powers are again wanted to be shown as strong men who are afraid to be set up to the Great Russia.
There is no hope that all those who are trying to resolve the open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their great responsibility for life, not only military, but all of the usual people on both hostile parties, and will stop their enemy action at the time.
Bulgaria first showed inflation in eight months
According to nationals, in Bulgaria, in July, the inflation rate of 1 % was reached.

The US secret services followed the Russian hacker attacks for a year.
The information on Russian attacks was made public last month when the Federal Research Authority (FBI) notified that the attack on the servers of the website of the Democratic Centre is involved.
The Russian part of the attack is not mentioned by any official reports.
The Moscow part of the attack was deceived.
The report on the follow-up of a given Russian attack was extremely secret because it would show that the American secret services of the hacker attack monitored and discovered how they do it and what resources it uses.
Two Russian reporting services were probably participated in attacking action.
New Cyber Security Advisory Council
The Russian tracking material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reées wrote.
Only a small group of the eight main works of the Congress, called in the United States gang eight, was informed of public factors.
It is created by both the Common Mitch McConProperty and Paul Ryan, presidential democrats in both Nancy Pelosiova and Harry Reid and four members of the Congress Security and Security Committees.
The Officer of the Democratic Party Donna Brazile announced on Thursday that it would create a cycle security advisory assembly, which would "to prohibit future attacks and ensure the primary protection of the Democratic Party servers".
In Albert's loss, he was a dangerous parasite.
I'm sorry.

Once the customer bought this product, he could return it in any of the tradings of the railway and get the money back.
Larvy destroys brass and sufficient heat adjustments
The seller was the Nekton-Varniata company.
The production of a dangerous product of hygiene was informed by the Prague and Mediterranean veterinary administration.
According to a server of safety food.cz people after the destruction of the parasite can sickness of anaxiouse, which is manifested by the pain of breastness, divorce and nausea, or the disease can run without sign, introduced by the CTK.
Symptoms will be given to two weeks after consumption inadequately hepaticly processed fish.
After three weeks from the start of the larve disease, the spontaneously leaves the use tract.
Adult red and larves are sensitive to higher and lower temperatures, so they are killed or in sufficient heat processing of fish meat, or when it is frozen.
The veterinarians have currently checked the loss as well as the beneficiary of the imported goods in the Middle Country.
Three of the five tested samples had a parasite.
The production of 1700 products came to the CR in accordance with the State veterinary administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Exposed, in total in the Ahold row, was to 919 packaging today.
At the current time, the download of unselling products from sales is carried out, said on Friday, the SVS Petr Pejchal speaker.
The veterinarians immediately after the finding of positive samples prohibited the sending of other products in accordance with this Regulation.
Seventy-year Brittany wanted to get out of Rakka, killed her obviously a Russian flipper.

They have a command to shoot without thinking, the Telegraph lawyer's family lawyer of Tasnim Akuniee's dead girl.
The last tracks were brought to Rakka, where the girl was calling back.
Then there's only a message about her death that can't be verified.
The family communicated with her from the apartment in East London.
They together examined how she could get from Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped they'd meet the former student again.

On the week when (Kadiza) thought of fleeing from the country of the Islamic State, one Rakušan was tried to flee and, according to the available information, was publicly killed to die.
I think that (Kadiza) she expressed it as a warning and decided to be nervous, according to BBC Akuniee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old friends from Shamimou Beguma and Amiro Abas were released on the road of 17 February.

You would have brought the blue out of heaven just to get your child out of danger and this family did everything she could to drink all the strength to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without risking that they were thrown up, the lawyer added.
The only positive is that the judgment of Kadisis may serve as a fearing case for other girls or boys who are allowed to shame islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people were released there, they realized how things were there, understanding how far it was different from the promises of the propaganda of the Islamic State, and they wanted to return," he stated further.

“Anime” effect on Snapchat is criticized as asiatic career
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired nowhere, but some observers say that it is racially irrelevant.
The Snapchat application allows approximately 150 million people to change the reality and play with the identity of the ways that are in the absurdity.
You can make ananas, dogs or positions that are like to get out of the image of Roye Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfishes every day.
Any mistakes will be published immediately.
Snapchat's filters have been criticized in the past with accusation that it propagates blackfacing or supports white wheels as a idea of beautifulness.
So when this week he offered a filter, which caused the weighty eyes, the decked teeth and the inflammated faces, some critics indicated it as the racist care of the Asiates - "yellowface".
And they wondered whether these repeated questionnaires do not indicate the problem of society -- the problem of divergence.
In the middle of the Verge and Motherboard, the news and fires were spread and Snapchat immediately indicated that he had cancelled.
Society offered an explication: Filter was intended as a manifestation of non-Asiatic positions, not as a caricature of the Asiates.
But to observers who were witnesses of racism, the filter recommended painful stereotypes in action.
Others without pack comparison with any refusal.
Grace Sparapani, a American art student from Korea, whose twoth of photographs was largely divided, reported in the e-mail that the filter was “the least damaged and cruel”.
She added that “there is difficult to argument the comparison of evident Asian career and the effects of the filter.
It is shown that the filter is not only about the yellowface (yellowface), but that the yellow face is touched into an extreme extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company who has crossed these cultural borders.
It seems that the American culture in itself has an unnecessary degree of divergence and inclusion, from the wood meetings in corporations after Hollywood and equipment that we all wear in our hands.
And a major number of young people in Snapchat - who are more racial divergence than their elderly partners - may mean that you can expect more sensitiveness.
"When a Snapchat filter creates an image that is a wretchful for a certain person," Katie Zhu said on Thursday in the conversation, "the one is very hard to do this today without notice as it was before."
Katie Zhua, the product manager and the medium worker, decided to remove her to Snapchat on Thursday and invited the final to do the same.
In the medium article and in the telephone discussion, it is convinced that racial motivated problems reflect the lack of divergence in the workshops in Snapchat.
Katie Zhua criticized overwhelming white, completely human leadership of the company, and the article drew hash to: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's like that there is no divergence between employees and colorful people at the moment when he decides about these things," Zhuova, who has Chinese-American p's, "or there are barely people working, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to speak."
Other observers share her opinion - the complaint that Snapchat left in significant way without answer.
The company does not publish numbers relating to the differences of its employees by having a status of a private company.
In Thursday, Snapchat refused to speak about the racial particle of its employees, but, according to the speaker company, recently adopted an employee who should focus on an inadequately suspended population and the internal management of the inclusion.
Zhua adds: “I am aware of whether other persons are really able to say that it's not okay, ” and it'll remain dismissed.
Army members draw reporting information on IS, says the Parliamentary Committee
The Parliamentary Committee, issued in the report on Thursday, stated that the representatives of the Central Government of the United States had changed the reports of reporting services in order to provide more optimistic images of war against Iraq and Syria than the events of the country.
According to the preliminary reports of the group established by the President of the Republic of Armed Forces Committee, the Rapporteur Service Committee and the Defence Committee, the "ground incompatibleness" has been detected between the analyses of the Central Rapporteur Services which have changed their assessment of the American efforts to combat the Islamic State.
The Central Government, known as CentCom, is a military center in Tampa in Florida, watching American military operations at Central East and Central Asia.
The printing report states: “The outcome of the reporting secret services approved by Centcom's overcome officers have usually offered more positive images against terroristic efforts of the United States than confirmed by countries and were constantly more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community."
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when an error analysis is submitted to the overcome political creators," Ken Calvert, congressman and Republic of California said.
The failure in the Centcom leads to the top of the organization.
The decade report detailedly describes the survival problems of the Central Charter in the description and analysis of American efforts at the train of Iraq forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although no decision-making evidence is offered that Obam's superior representatives have ordered to amend messages, the report states that the analytics had the idea that the leaders of Centcom were under pressure to present more optimistic views of the danger represented by the Islamic State or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many printing reports of the Centre Charter, statements and responsibilities from the Congress were significantly more positive than the events in the activity”, states the report.
For example, the representative of Centcom publicly declared that the primary military attack on Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains still under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is completely investigated after months," said Mr Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republic of Kansas, in the statement.
From the middle 2014 to the half of 2015, the highest position of the reporting officers of the United States Central Charter was manipulated with the outcome of reporting services for the purpose of bagalizing the dangers of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans have established a group’s work after they have learned about the risks of analysis that information on reporting services relating to the Islamic State is manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, it must follow more detailed examinations after further investigation.
In the reporting services, Centcom has further investigation conducted by the General Inspector of Defence.
The Democratic members of the Rapporteur Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some conclusions of the work group of the Republicans.
“In 2014 and 2015 Centcom created a very difficult process for the evaluation of information on IS and Iraq security records”, reported Representative Adam B. Board, President of the Committee and representative of Democrats.
According to the words of Adama ship, this process “wayed to cross outputs of reporting services”, he harmed the morality between analyses and “inadequately regarded incompatible opinions”.
However, the ships and democrates claim that they have not found any evidence that the white House would try to press Centcom's analysis to adapt their conclusions according to the "forms or political practices".
The preliminary outcome of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast.
Loni in August New York Times reported the current investigation of the Pentagon General Inspector, which was started after the Centcom analyses.
Commander-Commander Patrick Evans, speaker of Pentagon, stated that the Ministry of Defense of the Parliament Report will comment because the investigation of the general inspector still continues.
However, he stated that “the experts sometimes do not agree with the interpretation of complex data, and that reporting community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security”.
The investigation has an impact on the question of whether the American bombarding in Iraq and Syria is successful (the vote that now declares the increased number of defense representatives).
However, the lower accusation has called the questionnaires about how the President Obama could be able to facilitate the sincere value of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis places.
The reporting criticism of the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than ten years when the Centcom Gregory Hooker's reporting services analysis wrote a research work in which the administration of President George W. Bushe - despite a number of analytics - had a little unit in Iraq and had only a little time to think about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the opposite to the reporting services of the Islamic State.
Last year, the Authority notified that the Hooker team had been concluded that, despite public declaration of the opacity, the aircraft against the raffinery of the Islamic State, the financial resources of this terrorist group have not been extremely weak because the group built a temporary raffinery and sales on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the detection was not translated outside the central boat.
Head of Centcom, Mr. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then detailed criticism in the year after many lawmakers were looking for the testimony of the Senate too positive war evaluation.
General Austin departed in August in Centcom and replaced her in Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wined in the earthly hoke in the fourth department in order to play a decision in the team of Great Britain
Katie Bam's in the fight against Japan, who ended with winning 6:1, shot three shoes and only a day after that for the American earthly hoke team shot the first two hokes in which India was killed on Thursday, America struck India 3:0.
The five in two bags are successful memory, but Bam (27) said that she was not sure if she had ever done something like that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not looking at those who're recording their libraries.
But this knows: Americans at the Olympian tours lead at 4 to 0. They are the first place in the group with the Great Britain, who remained on Thursday after Japan 2:0 has remained unexpected.
The Great Britain and the United States will be concentrated on Saturday in the last hole of the first round.
Both teams were held in the quarter finish, and the storage will decide who of the six teams group will end first and who on the other side.
The team from the first place will be avoided by the strong Danes who are on the top of the second group.
Whatever the Sabbath is done, the Americans here have called their surprise leader, four years after that they ended between 12 teams in London games.
That was Bam's team.
She grows in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and the hokey on the ground hokey first took in her hand when it was three years (her elderly sisters were two playing in Drexel) and entered into a national team when she was 16 and became his youngest game at all.
The Olympiade was destroyed in 2008 because she was missing to the end of the event.
Then it came in 2012, when it did not have too much eating or members of her team.
The next year was a trainer named Anglican’s Parnham and things began to change.
"Cultural change, soul of change, physical change," said Bam.
We had no work in London as we had today.
We made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half of the shooting of the neighborhood.
India entered the bathroom without winning in the tour, but the team appeared as surprisingly strong and maintained the skin 1:0 to the end of the third quarter when Bam used the opportunity.
She went down on the left side of the game field, then called in the middle and shot the bottle into the gate to get the Americans to the leader 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last piece in half the fourth quarter.
The assembly of the Americans, Jackie Briggs, who helped each of the three winners, was at the first time on the tour.
He's in a beautiful form.
Like Bam.
"Now we're in a good place," said Parnham, but how good it is, it's going to be involved in the outcome of the Sabbath.
Without trampoline in olympical disorders
It's one where you're, it's one of the hours -- it's olympiade.
From the event in Riu de Janeir, it is to feel sustainable, unwritable and repeated competition and effort.
It's like the olympical origin itself would be a gross staffe kitchen, which is transferred from the flash, gymnasts and triatlonists.
You can't enable television, read the news or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the front of the coffee, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or immortality between Michael Phelps and Chadem le Clos.
And then Logan Dooley is also.
Dooley, the beauty of a woman with a bridge in the faces, is first on the olympy and may also be among those who, in particular, are in the households in the main sending time between the advertising and the meeting of sponsors, if he was a floor, a gimnast or even a shermire.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California fights for olympical gold in trampoline shoes.
The Olympian fire doesn't flame on all competitions the same.
From the middle, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognised: shoot from air weapons, lobby, badminton, taekwund.
We'll always have success in the classic floor, and it'll probably be governed.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me warn on the unfortunate trampoline cup.
Although the trampolyline of olympian sports since 2000, when the first was listed on games in Sydney, this sport remains after 16 years of intervention -- many people I asked and didn't know that it was olympian sport.
It can be about regional mildness.
The United States had never reached the trampoline springs and no athletes had reached to the final until 2012.
The prices in the man category are generally divided between China and Russia and in a female category between China and Canada.
For years, the golden medails from London will explain Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The springs on the trampolyline have a lot of more, partly because the ear of the unclean will seem more likely to go to the clown university than to the olympy.
I have to admit that I'm not a professional, but only a supervisor of the country.
It has a comic potential - comic vibrations of an unnecessary reflection - but also the lowliness of gymnasty and disorder, two sports that combine.
The word “trampolyne” is removed from the Spanish “el trampoline” that means “scokanic table”.
Aspiring champions go on a huge trampolyline that shoots up to about 10 meters and predicts the compositions with them of elements (shale, wheat and combination) before they finally get back on their feet.
According to the official olympical programme, the implementation, difficulties and “periods in the air” are evaluated.
In the Rio, he will have twenty atlets from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The obscure trajectory of the olympic road is in front.
The warfare of gold medails must go on, and even above, sometimes until the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
They are trying to reach not only the target or starto· wall, but as the television reports, including another mental line: the world or the olympic record.
This simple effort is noble, wonderful, a little fanatic - and enough to bring the wheat to the laughs.
But I think it's sometimes exciting when you follow the olympiade.
The trampoline springs in this regard contribute.
The athlete road on the trampolyline is upward.
There's no move forward.
He or she will reflect, as if they were in a state without weakness like astron, flying up, then down, and then again without wearing up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulty, but after the duration of the composition, there is no harmful fight for the achievement of the goal, no disturbance, but only perfect, low time and gravity.
It's just the nearest when the olympy is approaching the zen.
Qualification and final women are made on Friday, at 13 hours east time, and men's concurrence on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will finally send in the afternoon block starting after both days in 14 hours.
In the Olympian foolishness, they promise peaceful, pleasant moments that you will probably see through the ends.
And if he's focused on only that men's athletes will be the subject of loved views and weaknesses - as the Wall Street Journal report recently held on the United States Gymnasthe - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for their new fans that run on the breath.
“Protest generation” in Ethiopia, the United States Yearly Conjunction
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators who requested political changes in Ethiopia have insisted on the violent resistance of the government.
The Witnesses claim that during police shots, many protestants have been shot.
It's threatened in Ethiopia war?
In the past decades, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong west aliance with the growing economic.
In the past months, however, the country has experienced anti-governmental disasters that have been spread up to more.
Only in the last week, thousands of people who require fundamental political changes have gone into the street.
According to organizations fighting for human rights, the government's reaction was unfriendly.
The Witnesses claim that the police shot and killed the people of unarmed demonstrators.
On the burning video players of protests that probably become from the end of the last year or the beginning of this year, the security forces members are accused of as young people swallow after they were brought to the wall on their hands.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now requires adequate investigation.
"Always was difficult to maintain this country in the garden and to make a step before it will be even more difficult," Rashid Abdi, leader of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group Research Group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is supported by the second most popular people in Africa and its stability is supported by the Western.
American military and reporting services cooperate with Etiopan to eliminate the danger of terrorism attack, especially in Somalia, and a minor of African countries, if generally, receive such aid from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has developed an effective time.
Her infrastructure has in principle improved - in the main town Addis Abeba, even runs a new employment impact.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
In addition, Ethiopia can be difficult to mark as a pattern of democracy - a organization fighting for human rights without the disturbance of government repressions - opposition in the country has been hit, dissidents have been effectively silent.
Many of them were explained, arrested, killed or cast away into the wilderness.
However, it can change.
"When people are growing up and they do not have any other opportunity to protest, it will come to proliferation," said Seyoum Teshome, who leads to the University in Central Ethiopia.
He protests every young man.
Protests the whole generation.
It's very much, and it's all about from the land striking after absolute control of the power of the governing coal.
The Governing Party and its associates, following the lowly criticized elections, have reached the last stage of opposition and now controls 100% in Parliament.
Equally increased pressure on the border with Eritrea. The conflict divided this unexpected, cruel border requested hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitics are afraid that separatist groups who have been more frequently treated during the following years, such as the Oroms FreeFront or the Ogaden National Liberal Front, can be tried to use and rearrange.
There are several factors that explain why these bitter feelings have been burned again after years of surface.
Of them is probably unfair: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate with social networks until the last few years when they have become more slightly available phones and have improved the supply of internet services.
And even if the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as it is, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxy that are faced with the position of these people.
A number of youths of Ethiopians have spoken about the way they were disappointed by protests.
There is a more solidarity between Oromas and Amhary, two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oroms and Amhars are not natural associates.
After long age of Amhars, mostly from the Christian tops of Ethiopia, resulted in politics and trades and used the Oroms, from which many muslims are and live in lower.
But it's also changing.
"We're on the way to the united lead," said Mulatu Gemech, leader of Horomes.
The biggest protests occurred in the population of Amhary and Oromas.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Etiopias are wrongly dominated by the members of the ethnic of Tigrajs, which form about 6 per cent of the population and control military, reporting services, trade and policy.
The third of the accidents is the death of Melese Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the Resurrectioners, was the Ethiopian President of the Government for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he seemed to have a disease.
He was considered a tactic genius, a man who could see it as a corner.
Analytics say that especially mysteryly he has been able to discover the primary signs of unconsciousness and to use the disputes to process and get on his side.
"Current regime is aware of basic identity," said Abdi, a conflict analysis.
The new president of the Ethiopia Government, Hailemariam Desalegn, was extracted from relative ignorance to replace Zenawi.
On the part of Zenawi, who entered from North Ethiopia from Tigra, originates Hailemariam from the south.
Analytics say he doesn't trust in the security service controlled by Tigris.
Many are afraid that the outcome will be another blood flow.
In the past, Ethiopia experienced such anxiety in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what the analytics mentioned as elections that the government had chosen and then stolen.
He followed a strong principle during which many protestants were killed - even though less than in the past months - and this period of disasters has passed relatively.
The Ethiopian leaders in development evaluated the victory planning of infrastructure, which is a new economic impact and a measureable progress in combating poverty.
Of course, it is obvious that the progressive growth of conflicts within the Ethiopic government did not stop it.
And it comes to dangerous ethnic forming.
Last month Protestants in the Gondar City of Gondar attacked business companies owned by Tigrids and the contrary against Tigris on social networks remained still more running.
Analytics say that protests constitute an inappropriate United States and other western associations.
The American Government uses Ethiopia as a base for drones over the neighbourhood of Somalia, although recently declared that the foundation was closed.
While the West wants to support the democracy uniquely, he does not want his associate to fall in such a long term.
"This," said Abdi, "is a very hot food ashes."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obam and financing IS as “sarkasism”
Donald J. Trump tried to bagatelize the latest controversy, which switchs his campaign, declared that he didn't mean it seriously when sometimes this week was the President of Obama and Hillary Clinton were "based" of the islamic terrorist group.
The explanation made new issues regarding the ability of the Republican candidate to the President to speak with the US public.
He also sets in an inappropriate ration of his defense, which was solemnly defended at a bully time and must explain that he may have not thought seriously.
After this meeting in the middle of the night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and held in discussions that he had not intended to say that the President and H. Clinton's IS were created.
Of course, in Twitter's contribution on Friday Trump declared that he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was a repeated statement of the old one day when Trump in some conversations said that his accusation was seriously thought.
When the Hugh Hewitt voting moderate has tried to help Trump note by noting that Obama is seeking to destroy IS, the chairman's candidate did not respond.
The latest storm comes at the moment when Trump tried to take attention to his campaign to the economy, while his preferenties in pre-optional investigations are lost.
Trump and Clinton have been in Michigan for economic issues this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this theme.
On Twitter, he warned again that our Clintons are connected to increased taxation, and indicated that, according to ́k, her word was poor.
Trump used the defense of sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he switched the wall of criticisms when he came with us that the Russians should go to Clinton's e-mails, their note will start to explain the words: "I'm obviously sarcastic."
This access to Trump enables Trump to press the border of political declarations and to satisfy them as necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing in which some messages will be answered to his beneficiaries to find out how they react, and then, according to the reaction, “in one or other way,” said Ruth Sherman, a communicating specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think it's turning back in its statements and it knows they're sufficiently weak to explain differently.
Since the results of the pre-optional investigations in his benefits continue to fall, Trump chose a more favorable tone in the last days rather than to keep things in mind for the general electors.
The new review of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Tump is with a large distance from Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very closely after it in Florida.
Trump is at all trying to avoid excuses for providing the expressions that he says, but often he accuses his critics of the misunderstanding of his words or his incomprehension of his sense for humor.
But together with Trump in the final months of the presidential campaign increasing attention, Trumpo's stripes were introduced into an inappropriate ration of his loyal stoup, which must be publicly behind him, whether his notes are anywhere to operate.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former recipient of the city of New York, one of the most prominent Trump Stones, had to take the candidate on Thursday in the conversation for CNN.
"I think what he says is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani said when he was asked for Trump's complaint that Obama and Clinton found the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, the small organization, which he had completely called a newman, was not known, and it happened because he became his army from Iraq.
Most of the current Republicans are trying to argument that the Government of Obam, in which Clinton acted as a ministerial business, allows IS to become agressive and unable to control the Mediterranean.
Before Pennsylvania Trump's divorces in Pennsylvania Trump continued on Twitter around it, fired on the communicators because they loved all his word and were a reproach against him.
He smiled with the "poor, patetical" TV students who try to understand her, and said, "It can't!"
A number of democratics have been disappointed by Trumpo's excuses that it is only another evidence that it is not reasonable for the President's office.
The coffee is out of the price market. Now he's returning to Greenpoint
Café Verb Cafe was a place in Williamsburg where you could pay only ready, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee was given for 15 years.
Naturally, she was thrown out from the head of the house to Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the business that Verb replaced in 2014 - sells myths in the cup of cups.
The locals made it up as the last loss of the town growing up.
Artist Molly ́bapple on Twitter wrote: “New York is a change, I know, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea hotel is filled and from Verb is now the business."
But if New York is a change, then it's a re-recover.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened the hall in November in Greenpoint less than they were northward from the cup.
New Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the ppp workers work there and dominates a similar, humiliated atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The Manager of the New Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, an elderly employee of the cup coffee, which is, rather, a owner and executive manager of the new place.
In Verb he started in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the guests offered him to pay a move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left many things as they were.
Verb has still the same supplier and bought the same machine model for espresso.
Even again he used lighting from the ancient Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new arrangements.
In the offer there are sandwiches with sugar, wheat and syringe and toppings, such as caps and frozen cibules.
You'll also find a mix with a brilliant rose.
The coffee doesn't give a beer anymore, but the offerer of your fresh fruits.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the continuous impact of the poultry.
"A number of pc clients had to move from Williamsburg for prices, too," he said.
Last week, there was one of the guests, Rebecca Oliveur.
Ms. Oliveirova (34) lived in Williamsburg and the Verb Cafe often walked.
She did even when the café moved to Greenpoint.
She said, when Verb closed, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a time.
"I made sure what I had to do is coffee and culture in Verb," she said.
Now he drinks again coffee, but one day, instead of his coffee, she gave a mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another yearly client, is loyally going to Verb since 2003.
He's going before his work, and he's negotiating the same thing.
"In the fourth and eight here every day, as a hour, I will come and prepare for me my bottle with all and with meat," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of new arrangements.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to negotiate what's normal, but sometimes he's allowing all to give a bullet, a bullet, and a bullet.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry for the trade with the mills to take his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special mill for Verb and use a filtered coffee from coffee.
"I think they could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Poland people of Greenpoint also accepted the coffee.
One of the new clients translated the offer to the Poland and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would quickly set it up to feel his new neighbors like home here.
The new place has more advantages.
The local plant manufacturer wants to steal into the woods and sell a filtered coffee.
It's offered the possibility to expand the café into the neighborhood building.
Many clients have been able to get back their old favorite.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client, and when the coffee closed, he thought he was broken in his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the café opened again, entered and gave it a café, it's like to come home.
"I missed the fuck," he said.
Depression’s food from the crisis - in “Square Meal”
Soon after the president's arrival in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Ovale work and eating.
The labugger President Roosevelt encouraged the chosen food from the 5th avenue, such as a patrol from the households of the jail and the marine railway.
His menu on this day, but it was more humiliating: the wheat in the devil in the Paradise, the brass pire and as the decoration of the Swedk pudink.
"This was an act of kitchen solidarity with people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "The message was also to the Americans as they eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights is gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrewa Coea "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese kitchen in America, while Jane in his book "97 Orchard" explains the life story of a living house at Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", published by Harper, is American cuisine during a large economic crisis.
They showed the kitchen solidarity and met with the reporter at the dinner in Eisenberg's trade with sandwich, a small swimming buffet in the fourth Flatiron, which was operated since the period of crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) was negotiated with a mixed syringe and sandwich with olive olive, Andrew (57) gave her crocane, cash brain and mixed greenine.
The reporter dealed with a mass carbanate, which, according to a couple, was nice to talk about food during the crisis.
"The carbanates were very favorite," she said by Ziegelman.
He sold a bubble, nuclear and fasol carbanate.
They were produced from the race and other league foods that the ingredients had placed.
Don't stop the number of bullets that you should eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe was broken up.
"They would lie to you as a bullet," he said.
In years ago, the American kitchen, especially in the foreign areas, was given in the form of snow buffet, which you dream.
The women's teams were stuck for farmers and for dinner, dinner, and dinner.
They were Americans who sent food to the Europeans in the first world war. "A Square Meal" follows how the nation was equipped with the fact that it was not a country of diversity.
"It was the time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe explained why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same was afraid of a new budget diet: It was spread by mysterious foods, such as carbanates, and food from castrophes, castrophes as “in a way to use the rests, ” she noted Zegelman, because the kitchens could hide non-esthetical vessels under the layer of the cream.
The pure fruit was replaced by the leavingest fruit.
Maso - after long years the center point of America's food - became an extremely adequate luxus.
The wonderful smiles to be served as a calories and survival supplies had an advantage before the wound or even a healthy sense of breathing.
During the reviews for a book containing recepts, Mrs. Ziegelman prepared a periodic food from a coated cibule filled with a bulk oil.
"It wasn't a favorite advance on the dinner table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman commented: "It was surrealistic."
It's not going to be a bullet of the rubber with a throat.
It was typical for many home recepts.
As never before and after, the housewide economics, including Louise Stanley, have managed a federal office for domestic economy in 1923 to 1943, leading to the land's feeding advantages.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, invited women to overcome the budgets, and the lights, such as the meetan spaghets with darkness, changed to hot foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a glorious historical understanding.
Moreover, the challenges have occurred in the response to the government to her hungry citizens, as if possible, under President Herbert Hoover, "I'm giving me a cup."
While he publicly praised the simple yow farmer kitchen of his childhood, he became a chosen millioner.
"He was glad to eat the continental kitchen, such as fish with ovaric cow," Andrew Coe said.
He had a smoking on herself in a pretty wounded room.
He was incrediblely old.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor didn't accept her to go in a example of herself.
As the book states, Mrs. Roosevelt had an economy who was not interested in the pleasure, which led to that the White House “not only gave the most poor food in the whole Washington but also in the most unfortunate way prepared”.
A number of food advantages from the crisis was declined immediately when the country was replaced on the feet.
The link remained in our continuous examination of calories and survival values, says Mrs. Ziegelman, and in the way it applies to the public.
Parer says that during the writing of the book, the food habits of Ms. Zegelman was better understood by Ms. Zegelman - perhaps why she couldn’t eat.
"He had real fear of eating breathing," Andrew Coe said.
Zegelman noted, "The people of her were wrong."
It's happened to the crap of a little bitch.
When there were clean tables at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe dropped the dessert that prepared home: the Swedish dessert that President Roosevelt had eating for dinner.
"He's called a snowk cream," Zegelman said, and she added that the clothing trike was to give humble recepts a elegant name.
There was no cream, just swimming, a little mood, sugar, water and shortcuts.
Everyone unrepentantly cut a lie into a dust of a low-speaked powder.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a right economy, he said to his wife, "It would be a little sequential heirs."
Europeans: Migrants are going for doses.
The majority of appealers in Europe comes from economic deficiencies.
Young Russians make themselves pleasure.
That's how the series looks like when we've hit them.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, makes pleasure from his family country.
The photoshop help makes a coach that shows funny how it seems if the glorious series and movies were in Russia.
Gilead has a charge for the replacement of the costs for legal representation in the case of a patent against the type C against the Merck counterpart
The Court of Justice decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has a charge for payment for advocates which have been made in the process on the patent of type C against the manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc drugs.
In June, the sentence of Gilead was rejected to pay 200 million for damage due to the violation of two Merck patents in relation to the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after that the Federal Court made reacting against legal negotiations on the side of Merck, other than a lie under the swearing and other non-etical practices.
The Federal Court of Justice Beth Labson Freeman reported on Thursday that Gilead has an accusation of payments in relation to representation in the case.
Merck is trying to get Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of drugs against the type C-glucence, which can heal over 90 percent of patients with this jater disease.
The case comes from 2013 when Gilead and Merck complained each other and claimed that they were owner of the basic research for sofosbuvir, the active pharmacokinetics from Gilead.
American supported military units claim that they have obtained full control over the city of Manbidž
The military units supported by the United States have received full control over the North City of Manbydž near the border with Tureck after the last war of the islamic state from the city, introduced the speaking group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Force (SDF) is currently running after the rest of the group of radicals hidden in the city.
The units were released more than 2.000 civilians who were holding radicals, said to Agent Re日s Sharfan Darwish from the SDF and the military Council of Manbidge.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still looking for it," said Agent Reʹs.
Clinton in 2015 did $10.75 million and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton published its tax appropriation for 2015, in which it was stated that the presidential candidate for democracy and her wife had an income of $10,75 million in this year and led a tax of 34,2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton had a million dollars in charitation, especially in Clinton's mission (Clinton Foundation). Expert Bill Clinton contributed to the joint cash a total amount of a number of $5,3 million for advertising, and the former ministerial assets accepted a receipt of $3 million from the accommodation of Simon & Schuster for his book on its action to the Ministry of Zauvier.
Clinton partners, American Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia and their wife, Anne Holton, published the tax recognition for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a tax of 20,3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still the financial transparency pattern," she said in Jennifer Palmier, who helped Clintons with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hidden for false excuses and comes from his previous promises that his tax recognition will be published.
It is usually that candidates to the President of the United States will publish their tax recognition, even though the law does not impose it to them.
Trump, New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit of the United States Tax Committee as a d· to refuse to publish the tax appropriation.
"Your move", said the campaign of Hillary Clinton on Twitter, and called on the tax recognition of the Democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, the special Trump's adviser, said on Thursday CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax advice until the audits were completed.
According to Trump critics, including the Republican candidate to the President of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, it agrees that its refusal calls for questions regarding its pure profits, contributions to charity, business transactions and different relations, including Russian relations.
Clinton's in the question is strongly present and published on Friday the video in which it takes the high position of the republication on Trump to publish its tax recognition.
Thursday, the question refers to economic questions in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the final candidates did to the President's office after decades - to publish their tax recognition," she said before the people.
The Politica Organization noted that Trump was paying any or very low tax in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist cited a number of tax advisers and agencies that claimed that it could also be today.
The taxes of federal taxes became the subject of the President's election.
Clinton provides a rule named after a billion dollar to Warren Bufett, which would ensure that everyone who makes more than 1 million dollars per year will pay the tax at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supports us.
Last week Buffet on Clinton's meeting in Omaze, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, called Trump to meet and exchange tax appropriations.
Buffett said that he also had passed through the IRS audit and that Trump was "not afraid" of the financial authority, but of the electors.
The campaign of Clinton has published the tax appropriation back to 2007.
Clinton, who now live in Chappaqua in New York, in the average of 2007 to 2014 paid the federal tax in the average of 32 per cent and the combined tax in approximately 40.5 per cent.
The tax recognition of Clintons for 2015 shows that it is only 100 dollars in their receipts.
Their main investment was a lower balanced index fund from which Clinton had introduced income in dividends and rates of $109.000.

Condoms filled with chi ́ or fire for the protection of slones in Tanzania
The protectors of nature in Tanzania use a neortodox way to protect the slones in the way of walking into human habitats - the condoms filled with the work of chi.
This process was also certified by Honeyguide, which has come with the idea of a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and schools volunteers in the villages north of Tanzania, as to protect their homes and values in four steps without hurting animals.
Many of them first used copies for their defence.
Wednesday is the world's day of the suns, which is protected by the protection of these animals.
"From the time that this ... tool file has been developed, we have mentioned the change of behaviour in these communities. People are much more able to keep the slopes outside their field without to hurt them," said the Executive Director of the Opinion of Honeyguide Damian Bell in the statement.
The first and second step is to light the battery and start the cloxon on the looping row.
If it doesn't give her it, it's going to come to the exemption of such a "chi" cup.
Chi ́s mixed powder salts together with petardo to the condom, his end is to be able to see only the node.
After the departure of the condom, the condom is exploded and the air is spread out of the chi.
Most of them, one wallet's enough, and the slone's seen in another direction.
The last option is to decrease the fire tool that calls the voice, and explosion.
The Jewish register was thrown into the Berlin hotel because he removed the call code to Israel for the "demand" Arabs - RT News
The French film register of the Jewish pêu called a disruption in the media after he found that the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin had no input code for calling to Israel, according to the words of employees on the basis of the "request" of Arab clients.
Lanzmann, author of the documentary photo on the Holocaust “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in the opened letter to the German FAZ journal.
During his recent apartment, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in a list of codes for calling in the hotel.
However, the state was not listed between countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the main city of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol, instead, offers an opportunity to call to Israel through its own call centre.
The register was looking for explaining, and with the problem he returned to the reception of the hotel.
The answer he received, Lanzmanna according to his words "shokovala".
Worker of the hotel answered that the measures were "determined after Kempinski Hotels were approved."
D. to this step, the Regisseur has yet been more able to do.
"The most of our hosts are the Arabs, and they request that the calling code of Israel be removed," Lanzmann told employees in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s highlighter in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, the case was a "great offense".
We were scared and shocked away.
It's just about it. It's a big deceit.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and also in such a hotel box is even more disappointed.
There is no further explanation necessary.
We expect the hotel to make the correct conclusions," he said.
The event called a strong online reaction, people marked it as scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel was simply lost in the requests of Arabian clients.
“Hanba to you”, points out in another article, which shows that the hotel is located in the Kurfurstendam Street stands nearly.
According to Spiegel, the hotel alone refused any accusation by marking the event as a "view" and Lanzman was "excused".
"Never has been issued a direct order" to include Israel in the list of call codes, quoted by the representative of the hotel of Kempinski, Suddeutsche Zeitung.
Adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police used the gas and gum projects against protesting Brazilian students
To the center of students and police, in Brazil, San Paul arrived on Thursday when students met on demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police against Protestants used the gas and gum projects.
The problem was lost when the Governing Body Services were attempted to raise students, which ended by using gum projects and gas.
The demonstration was involved in a few hundred students in order to evaluate their concerns from the plans.
Among us, the State of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin to protect money is also closed at least hundreds of public schools and 300 000 students.
Some of the demonstrators were likely to see how they accept the signs on the walls against the provisional President of Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators were released to the street for the support of the meeting President Dilmy Rousseff, when he decided to sit in the country for her excuses.

Jzhgaryan also expects Russia to visit a recorded number of tourists from Iran for years.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued to the citizens of Iran about 35,000 visions, mostly traveling.
In addition, Iran was first obtained between top 20 countries according to the number of tourists coming to Russia.

Short Callum Skinner gets quick home after the British winning gold in cyclistics
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered last night in the garden of glory in a man's team sprint in Riu, when three VB teams had a title from London 2012.
Thirty-five years old abortion from Glasgowa was in the role of the wheat that he took for his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend rejoiced when he joined the goal and stealed a victory with the favorised hand of New Zealand.
British won over four years ago, and Hoy got five of his six olympics of gold.
And the same trick repeated after the end of the sixth seventh in the world championship in the road cyclistic in March, although Hoy ended during his career.
The problem between Peking and London was the refund for the specialised leader of Jamie Staff's director.
So the Hindes appeared right once.
After Hoye left, he also released the place that he tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt ́mpton.
Skinner was a man of British trainers and the search of potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoy Shampion four years ago - and Skinner reached the Olympian record at ́action, but the tricot took the first round of New Zealand.
And the British three got the gold team in the team.
And the Hindes was in his round easily behind, but Kenny's team switched before and Skinner held the leader.
The change of the strategy was a large part of the transformation when Hindes went to higher translation to relax and allow Kenny and by partly Skinner to maintain time.
Hoy's leader followed from his position of BBC comment and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes went up on the ground, he didn't leave their eyes.
Threety-year Skinner, a parent from Glasgowa, said, "It's a negative comparison."
I'm here to get the best of myself and honor my name.
We created a olympian record in the final and we destroyed the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After the triumph near Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he was approved after a weak start.
The note stood back, and the British companions had no opportunity to revoke.
This time this victory has not occurred to any such problem.
Hindes said, “I felt like in London with all these British ships."
In the last three months, we all were like a team.
We've lost a lot of world divorces, so the winning of olympy is simply anxious.
It's one event, one golden medail for a nation who wined seven of the ten competitions in Peking and London.
It must be a progress indicator in the next five months, then waiting for us for a successful five days.
With the shape that Kenny predicted, it is not impossible to repeat Hoy's success and win on one olympy three gold medaile at the same time.
It would then be for Kenny - which is exactly a day of 12 years older than Hoy, also birthday on 23 March (This date seems to be holy for the British sport, this day she celebrates the birthday, also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - was a total of six golden and one silver medal.
It's the same way how much Hoy got.
As the next, Kenny's going to take up the sprint that starts today and takes three more days.
Eighty - year - old boy in Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this.
The team's the best.
You win with the final.
To say the truth, winning for meself is a little single.
Hindes said, "When he wins two other golden medals, he should have a title."
It was the only medail claim that day, but the British were waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed ́ncy, Steven Burke and Owain Doll were the best in the stumbled companions at four miles.
We ended with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
Private rounds and finals (22:42) are held today in the second day of the divorce, on which the Wiggins will be acquired.
He discussed with the Commissioner last night before the campaign, when the decision was invited to deal with the height.
In the surface of a woman who continues and ends tomorrow reached Laura Trotva, Joanna Rowsell Shandowa, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie World Record with time 4:13.260.
The VB team came to his strong road cyclist team and controlled the middle period of Olympics and gained a lot of medal.
After the outcome of exceptional effects showing full overcome in Peking and London, the expectation of Rio was decreased during the preparation.
In the background, dramatic events, in the immediate order of the Technical Director Shane Sutton in April for accusation of sexualism and discrimination, and the end of the carrier of majors such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as it brings the first night of travels on the highdrome, the legendary reputation that the British team can give a spectacular performance with perfect time, could be confirmed again.
Increasing future in Portland after the end of energy supply
The future of the Portland Clinic Clinic in Victoria - and the workshops of hundreds of workers - is uncertain for the electricity that the company resources the electricity and who informed about the purpose of one of the owners of the staff with the delivery of electricity.
This step is followed by what the Government of the Victoria State before this year decided that it would not extend the supply of interventions that the undertaking holds in progress.
The validity of the twenty-year-old appeal will expire in November.
Alcoa Portland may be in danger of up to 2000 workshops.
When closing, it can be threatened to 2000 workplaces - direct or indirect.
And because the plant needs about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, it can reach other lavine effects.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Tavier, which led to the lock of the electricity.
The Alcoa company's company in Portland is tradeful and threatened to close it.
This step follows a number of years of speculations on the future of the undertaking, in the reaction to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the production of a conversion.
AGL, which adds an electricity from the Loy Yang A electricity in Latrobe Valley valley, stated that it expects some of the other three owners to be determined to end.
The majority of the owners of the customer is the joint company of Alcoa and Alumina, small trade shares holding the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects that the Portland driving continues to work, so other words that the exciting request will continue after electricity from the bathroom,” she reported.
The AGL noted that the ‘certificate compounds’ were called with the loops to enter into force since November 2016.
With May 12 months of responsibility period, their validity will be completed in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that they will participate in the profits for the 2017 fiscal year”, stated the electricity.
Any possible impact on the profits of AGL since the financial year 2018 is currently concerned by the strong view of the commodity market for the high-trade prices of electricity.
AGL noted that it had already entered the value of the contracts under its annual books in $187 million in the case that it would be completed.
The company Alcoa noted that the decisions to terminate “not affected its ... ability to operate the train or to ensure the supply of electricity in the farm”.
The American company concluded in 2010 with Loy Yang contract for 20 years that had to be paid since November this year, although still needed to explain why she had been dismissed from its own.
Analytics are very careful about the possibility of closing the Portuguese staff in Victoria and Tomago in near Newcastle as a result of a weak economic in the sector.
The leader of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analyses at the beginning of this week, said that Portland annually needs about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these enterprises were downloaded from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in the market [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only a realistic TV show of Kardashian - now it's a serial Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), the model and the fourth daughter of the mother-manager of Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the title page of the American Journal Vogue.
Kendall, the ambassador of Stee Lauder's label, who was leading to a fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday at Instagram.
"In the room of full people I love, I want to weep on this title page," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the title page followed bizarre (or simple continuation of humor in the delivery of Kardashian?) inscened videos in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jenners (color exhibitors Rob and Caitly and together with them all the favorite boy from the shoubisnis, the manufacturer Kee月 Up Ryan Seacrest). On the contrary, they forgot their sisters just to finish the classic turn: they prepare a secret party.
It's a covered line at least every "born" work of the child's TV show (Seacrest says: "You thought we forgotten you?" with the sincerity of a drawn chair in order to eight hours ago), but Krissak needed to make sure that the final girls could live in this public.
Because when we're looking at the Vogue magazine number, we're sure we've entered the new era of Kardashian.
The elderly sister Kim may have touched Vogue's cart (he was with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the recording record is another disease.
The magazine of Vogue is the most sold number of the year.
The exhibition of the book for advertising more than the modern magazine is attached to the entire number of inserents (Fashionist emphasised that the 832 pages of the remote issue were 615 parties with the public area).
The discovery of a star that appears on the title page is unexpectedly expected, so it is not sure that in the past two years, the journal photographs have disappeared before its official publication.
In the past, women who have appeared on the battle belonged to Naomi Campbell, Linda E. E. or Kate Moss.
In the past years, on the title page, there was more “celebritis that make models” than “the models that are celebrites”.
Jennifer Lawrence, the holder of Oscar and the ambassador of Dior's mark, appeared on the title in 2013, for a year after the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But although it is very impossible that Kendall - which magazine describes as a "middle model" of her generation - falls into the first category, it will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not relatively known people, nor stars of realistic shows, or children today, who can see how to do well-selected videos (and when Jenner represents all of this).
It's evidently talented women that result in anxiety of the future.
Beyonce, who appeared on the title page, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course not everyone's successful Jenner's surprise.
Her position in the world of mode will be difficult for her ownness in reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the Victoria's Secret, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called it "mister girls".
These feelings have been burned again with the report that Jenner's going to appear on the Vogue bag.
But this inconsciousness is not at the place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cart of the Seal Vogue.
It's a super model in the right word of meaning.
The leader for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you make up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you photos themselves on their own paywallets.
He sells the daughter of Cindy's, which photographed for the LOVE magazine.
And in free moments, he's looking for reality show, perhaps just as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community Legal Aid Centre Annually Rejected 160 000
More than 160 000 most threatened citizens are rejected in community centres each year, and in the sector themselves are affected that will have further financial restrictions to the oversight of the service which is already increasing.
In Queensland, three of the five people - mostly people in progress, immigrants, threatening work, victims of violence and people without financial abilities to fight injustice and similarly - are refusing to seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so pressured to cover, are addressed to other ships.
Since June the next year, these legal aid centres will come to the additional 30 per cent of federal funds.
The Community Aid Assistant Director in Queensladu James Farrell said that, according to the latest report of the National Community Association of Aid Centres, five thousand were denied each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without rejecting the decision of the Federal Government, the government will be abused.
"The Community Legal Aid Centre in Queensland is chronicly underfinanced, which means that thousands of people are rejected of lifely important services which they hold," he said.
People who have disappeared from the relations with the violent, people with excessive and protecting debts, families who are dismissing, workers who are wrongly released - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this message shows that they have no chance to get the help they have.
From June 2017, the Federal Government reduces the financing by 30 per cent, which will lead to the need for further thousands of threatened people from Queensland to be addressed in complex legal problems without aid.
We call on the State Representative and Senator Queensland George Brandis to prevent this recycling of funds so that people can receive aid when they get to legal problems.
In the past year, the Government of the State has received its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid to the above international dimension.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the community legal aid centres and the community of their customers and the Government of Palaštuk must invest in this important work.
Love for the campaign Donald Trump after the number member of the weapons was obviously measured
New York: The campaign Donald Trump was charged for a particular inactivity after that they were informed that the operating manager in North Caroline had put a gun on the member of the shoe during the jump.
Incident was described in a courtyard, which in the middle of the State Court in Charlotte delivered Vincent Bordini, an ex-software schooler in the state.
Bordini said that the months had been waiting for the internal solution to the conclusion that “they will rise”.
Director Earl Phillip “notifyed the rings of the gun, gave the right commander to the cup and measured the head of Vincent on the boy,” said Bordini in the complaint.
The write states that Bordini, after complaint to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, has made sure at least four other people have lived the same.
"The weapons do not have to shoot to cause damage," said Bordini in the complaint.
The claim comes only two days after what the Republican candidate for the president had approved when he said to the electors in North Carolina that they could cross the owners and holders of weapons (which is adjusted in the second instance of the United States), if his assistant Hillary Clinton is chosen and will be able to name their judges.
Trump's campaign says that the mediums of his words were out of the context and that Trump didn't act violently.
Bordini in the complaint requests a refund campaign for a lack of supervision and from Phillip to threaten personal security, illegal use of violence and emotional injury.
Trump's speaker Hope Hicks on a news on request for a comment immediately responded.
It was unable to get out of Phillip's exhibition.
WCCB, the local reporting officer in Charlotta, announced that Phillip was gone from the campaign recently.
The phone to his Advisory Company Innovative Consulting Services did not respond during a short time.
The Republican candidate to President Donald Trump has a controverse pre-elective campaign.

British must expand the olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and over London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is a very attractive way, just as London was 2012, when we have developed extraordinary efforts, and they have assured that all our nations and regions will be able to weak from olympics.
Olympian games were significant contributions for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again to create opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities, we create 10 000 new educational places, 40 000 new jobs and relate to the unemployment of young people around the aircraft.
Similarly, as before the London olympide in 2012, those who will think that Heathrow extension is too large.
I was told that the British never was ready for olympics and that on the world's ground we'd be dismissed.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow will show that they had no truth.
It'll always be necessary to get overcome, but Heathrow can answer every question that's relating to him.
Like Olympics games, Heathrow is a project of infrastructure in which many people and fires are shared, not only a few.
Extension is the opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion billion billion billion billion, to leave the inheritance in the likelihood and employment as well as in the area of the aircraft, so throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team on Heathrow, which has introduced a programme of investment in the infrastructure for 11 billion billion billion billion billion billion, starts with the T5 terminal - which was chosen by the best terminal in the world five years ago, after the T2 terminal, which was set between the two most moved ranways in the world.
Now they are ready to add the third vulnerable to 16 billion litres of private investments.
The games in London in 2012 were very successful in Great Britain and I am convinced that the Heathrow extension will be also.
It's time, and they continued to spread the spirit of the Olympian Hers and expanded Heathrow, ensuring trade in the future, and abandoning the inheritance of the power and employment on which British might be honest.
Lord Paul Deighton is the president of the Council of Representative and the former issue for the business of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in a cat game and mouse blocking advertising
From the trials to run programs blocking advertising, for companies that are on the online marketing has become a game on a bit and a mouse. At least one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, so only two days after Facebook announced that it would block the advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published the contribution on its pages, which indicates that the users can update the filters in their program and reblock the public on this social network.
Facebook showed that his desktop pages will change the encoding around the advertising to be more consistent for advertising filters, which parts of the pages are advertising.
Adblock now states that new codes have already been broadcast.
The Language Adblock Ben Williams in the blog reported that “This is a war between the community of open source blocking advertising and those trying to take them away from the time that the advertising blocking was found” and that Facebook probably will come with another own work.
The fact that the company's owner of the world's largest social network has been involved in war, it only proves how a big problem with the blocking of advertising for the future has occurred.
According to the study that Pagefair and Adobe conducted in the world, they use about 200 million people - nearly fourth of people before it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the benefits from the Facebook advertising, Facebook visits 1,03 billion active facilities each day.
The speaker noted that the company was going against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters on mobile networks and Instagram are not working.
Recovery on desktops still represents so high that Facebook decides to invest.
Facebook also indicated that it would update the tool for the "configuration of advertising" (ad preferences) to give people the opportunity to control how the publics are shown to them.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that the new Adblock filters are concerned because they could also block the contents that are not applicable to the public.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to resolve this problem," said the speaker Facebook in the e-mail statement.
The blocking of advertising is an insignificant tool, and therefore we have been focused on building tools such as Ad Preferences, which give people control.
A woman struck the Swiss remote car
The victim was lying on the remote night.
Police is looking for the witnesses of events in which on Thursday in the wound hours there was a few vehicles taken by a woman who probably tried to burn suicide.
The accident occurred at the A1 district near Morges in Vaud canton shortly after midnight in Thursday.
The police in Vaud in the statement stated that the actor's trusted act was in the darkness of the street and overcome her a few cars.
It was said that the victim, a woman in Quebec 49, wanted to kill her and hit her a few cars, including a cost vehicle.
She died in the place.
A few drivers have already been heard, but, according to the police, they have not yet been identified.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in the age, such as this, said for Le Tribune de Geneve's legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to check whether some of the involved drivers will be committed by the same accusation.
Did it be possible to protect the next time?
"This must be a complaint," said Hofstetter.
Based on two similar cases of the next five years, the drivers seem to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was about a person walking on the remote side - was decided that motorists could not expect a walker who passes over the remote night as the newspapers were introduced.
Last year, the police officer was released for the death of the insult after the night in August 2014, and killed a man who lied on the A1 valley near Paynerne.
In the court, the victim had been drunk in 22 years of age, and it was thrown on the street.
The Court believed that the police officer, who reacted to the noise calling, had been in a proper way and that the presence of a man on the road was “increasingly exceptional and unpredictable”, said the judge.
Anyone with information on the quarter incident to Morges should be reported to the police at phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.

Pat and Mat celebrate forty years.
The unreducable Path and Matt, whose effort ends around the disaster, enjoys small and big waves for forty years.
The pilot part of this dinner series of director Lubomira Bennese had the premium on 12 August 1976.
After the result of this animated series, which now knows divisions in more than hundreds of countries of the world, were drawn by the manufacturer's footsteps and the Revisor Lubomira Bennese, who thought about the magazine with the two corners of Mr. Oucholick and the Sedlec.
Benas then invited to cooperate with the dramatic of Jiří Kubička and the manufacturer of Vladimir Jiránk and together created a movie of Cutiacs.
Today, the illustration with the yellow and red trick and the cow and the pool was given in 1979, when it began in the Short Film of Praha to produce a series for the Slovenian TV.
The names Pat and Mat were then received in 1985, this time it was already running directly for the Short Prague movie.
In 1990, Lubomir founded its own study of an animated AIF film in Prague and Curych, where other parts were produced.
After his death in 1995, further shares with other creators continued, and many of them shared Benez's son Mark.
Now there is over ninety episodes with the stories of these bottles that all are under the hands, but never hurt themselves and are full of optimism, ideas, and cutiles, and finally, they are satisfied with their work, which adds to the known geth "...and it's!".
Pat and Mat even moved from television images to books, DVDs and divisions or other games with Pata and Mata are the hit of every game.
A battle for Fiji and for a two-year Harmonia.
The end of the week is in the sign of the battle, we have chosen one sport for you and one of the lives.
Both have a good end.
So let's go look at it.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the result of the joy of the whole country?
A two-year British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And for what things are people most losing on the aircraft?
This is a weekly review from the world's webs.
The medaile from the olympics.
History success celebrates the island of Fiji.
Ragby's choice of this island struck in the Olympic tournament final of the seventh ragby team of the Great British team.
It's the first medail that Fidge got on the olympy for himself.
Waiting for the winning of the first valuable coffee was sixty years from sending the first exhibition to the olympic games.
The great debt for success is led by Dr. Fiji.
But it's ironic that I'm Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been conducted since 2013 and after the final which British citizen could be satisfied by its countries.
"Let's play free and easily and see if the biggest story in our history will be able," said the trainer before the final.
Fiji finally controlled her sovereignly, and a small state with 900 thousand people now lives in olympy.
The report was brought by the French journal Le Monde.
New friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who lives without hand and has received a new friend since 11 months.
The lady looks like her.
"Mommy, she's like me," the two-year girl rejoiced as her mother's caused for ABC News.
She added that her daughter's girl's hands and feet, and then she's sitting together without a protese.
Harmonia was accompanied by meningitide of type B in the past year, and the doctors gave them only ten percent chances for survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love for her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she's never surprised.
He's got a survey.
I saw her representing the last child with the word Hi, I'm Harmonie and I have no hands, added my mother.
Look at the joy of the girl.
What's the most we're losing in the aircraft?
CNN provides discovery, according to which people on the aircraft will lose the most out of the packed water.
The sale of Hudson's travelulars has published data in the last year, where it holds 10 products that customers in his business bought most often.
The water was sovereignly first.
The drinks were generally very favorite, in the first decade, eight.
The ninth place contained a large M&M bonbons package with cocoos.
And you can decide who will close the first decade?
As one of the above things, it can't eat.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal.
Among the following annual news on airports are: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
These are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economyst.
Western sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray's laughing with Bond.
Earic Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have sovereignly kinged the category of two without a feedback seven years and their dominants have also confirmed the Olympics games in Riu de Janeiro.
In the first view, the two of them passed to a smaller debt after the olympy in Peking and has lost competition since 2009.
On the Rodrig de Freitase laundry, they were added to the quarter final of the 69th exhibition.
What are we else than the ends?
We're just pretty beautiful, Murray's already shown through the Olympics Regates when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the new Zealand two.
Honestly, we don't do anything different to the end.
We're just training strongly, very strong.
And we're still trying to improve our technology, that's our philosophy, said Murray more seriously.
Their government is careful and because they are physically different.
Murray is nearly a two-meter and stokyl chess, a academic looking Bond is five meters less and 15 miles easier.
Moreover, he has a different power.
Bond's studying and financeing, Murray has a charitable boxer.
It doesn't take too much time outside the district.
Eric comes in the ship in the main way we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I have a tendency to think about what can be shown, acknowledged Bond, who even on the printing graphic suggested that the dominant in the seat is Murray.
He just answered as the first, and Bond waited for his opportunity.
However, the waters will destroy peaceful forces.
They eat their time, and maybe they are still not in the middle of the treasure, they have not yet found a reception on their progressive treatment.
We're conducting two miles [2 km] traces, and we never wanted to go to the first miles [1 km].
We're just trying to take time that nobody else can't.
We know what we have to do, and we won, said the fourty-year Murray.
With his four - year - old younger partner, he received seven golden medals for the world’s mistership.
They triumphed in 2007, even when both members of gold four were free of food.
Just after an unexpected failure, more olympics in Peking for a year were decided to move on a double without a feedback.
At the olympy in London, the largest destruction of their career was apparently opened and dominants confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the trainer said to us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more funny.
We knew that it would be fucking hard, and we had to make sure we were well on that psychic, Murray introduced.
We know everyone wants us to get out of the throne.
We've always got the fire on our backs.
But we're trying to be half step before all, added.
NASA climate model: Venusha was ever resident
According to the projection of a new NASA climate model, Venus was ever resident.
Scientists in the Goddard NASA Institute for University Study developed a model for Venezuela's examination using tools and algorithms similar to those who use climate studies.
The model was proposed to determine whether on Venezuela, whose surface is heavy, without water and coated CO2, could rule submines like submins on Earth.
Scientists have already said that the low or lower turnover of Venus can explain her dust atmosphere.
According to the latest simulation, Venezuela seems to have been able to swim down with a rare atmosphere like the earth, and then she turns quietly.
The model also experienced the previous topografie of Venush.
The planet was probably more tower than on earth, but sometimes there was enough water and agricultural diversity in it to dominate life and provide protection against the departure.
She also used the Sun before, which was about 30 percent of darkness.
“In the simulation of the GISS model Venush during the late turn, he sets its day side to the sun almost two months once,” explained GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is how the surface and the creation of rain produces a dust level of darkness, which can be protected as a rain and a surface from a excessive solar heat.
The result is the air with median temperatures that are in the ability to be lower than at present on Earth.
The model made the story of Venus a similar evolution, which previously the hypothetics of the planetariums were created.
Although Venezuela was probably resident in the past -- in the past a few billion years -- it was set up too much hot and ultrafial backup.
Its oceans were covered and the water couples were burned by the ultrafial light.
The water was unleavened and was only a cruel atmosphere of carbon oxide with the mortal cycle gas -- it's Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy restored to the Colorado Avalanche trainer post
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his trainer's post and vice-president of hokey operations by Colorado Avalanche team, as d· did the possibility of participating in the decision process in the issues of the team.
The Executive Vice-President/General Manager Colorada Joe Sakic confirmed the step and indicated that the club will start searching for a new trainer immediately.
“The last three years I have acted as the main trainer and vice-president of hokey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, weight and decision”, stated the 50-year Roy in the statement.
I thought long and intensely during the years how I could improve the team, give him the depth that he does, and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the views of the trainer and the vice-president of hokey operations be in accordance with the organization's vision.
It must also have the opportunity to participate in decisions affecting the exercise of the team.
These submines are not fulfilled at the present time.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he did for our organization, and we take him in the future very happy.
Roy was nominated to Jack Adams as the best treaty trainer during his first time with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He brought a team to profit 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, looked with Minnesota in the first round play-off and during the last two years, he was not able to go up.
The Avalanche team in 20152016 reached the skin 39:39:4 and missed five points to get another wild card in the West Âa.
Brother Roy, who wrote to China the glory, wined Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
Workers in the North Sea renew conversations and break the stage
The top representatives of the parties have noticed that the staff for the work of the North Sea are interrupted, while all the parties of the dispute met on a new round of negotiation.
To staff against the Wood Group's field service company, the boards in the North Sea operated by Royal Du日 Shell were affected by the Royal Du Shell.
“Wood Group and United Nations and RMT Committees may confirm that the process for the solution of current accidents has been agreed,” it is stated in the declaration.
In the next week, we will have a number of weeks of meetings in the next week, where we will try to see the new angles.
According to the committee organizations, their recent action, which was the first of their words in more than 25 years, was to protest against the walls of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group reduced the taxes in the year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9 per cent less because of the negative market pressure.
The reduction of the rate of the company comes after the ten-percent reduction for the surrounding company in 2014.
The community claims that other ships would have made the company room to compare with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has drawn out from his bills of thousands of people and announced the plans for the release of operations on the field of rope and gas up to 10 countries for modernization of its processes - without the mega of mega with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure for low prices of rubber, economic ability associated with the red decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the Parliament of Scotland Dave Anderson met the committees to negotiate one of the largest work accidents of the whole generation leading to the staff in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we will have an economy that works for all, not only for some," he stated in the statement.
For comparison, in 2016 nearly 1,4 billion dollars are expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average of the next five years was about 7 billion dollars.
Kepler measures the ability of turning stars in the Flights
The latest mission of Kepler's universal telescope to help the astronoms is to obtain a complete list of stars from the Plejada stars.
The new data helps astronoms to understand why the stars in the starcape are concerned with different hedge, and how the time of turning relates to the design of the planet.
“We hope that comparing our results with other stars we will learn more about the relationship between the stars, its age and even the story in its solar system,” in the new report of Louisa Rebullovva, the research worker in the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The starcope of Plejada is located in 445 light years from Earth.
A lot of stars in the middle are now reaching the level of growth, and they have survived over 125 million years.
Now it's going to be the best.
At the moments of the maximum turnover of these adult stars are released by the great amount of the star.
Because these stars are moved to the part of the magnetic star fields, they have a relaxing rubber on them.
With the old stars, it's also relaxed with her turnover.
Kepler measures the ability of turning every star so it measures the time between the opening of the identifiable points on the stars -- like the sun's square.
According to the latest data on the rotation of the stars are turning down less than the weight of the stars.
The Rebulla compares stars to dance, more pirates are doing less than those smaller.
"In the "balet" Plejad we see that the slightest stars are more massive, while those who are the most swimming are usually very easy stars," replied the Rebulla.
Because the starcape of Plejad is so close, it serves as a ideal cosmic laborer to compare the quality of the star and the rotation.
"Pleasures give us a coat for theoretical models of star rotation into both directions, younger and elderly stars," replied Rebullava.
It is still much that we want to learn about how, when and why the stars disturb their eye of turning and thus say, “they're talking about their dance boots to the bottles”.
Rebullava and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of Plejad in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal magazine.
Is the agreement necessary?
If I hadn't agreed, would I haven't concluded the →Accord and I could go to another hospital after a few months?
Is it possible to work after study without logging into specialization?
I am concerned that in the work in which I want to work, it is now a free job in place only in some more remote hospitals, but a half-year degree could be released in another place where I would then work.
So I don't know the advice of how this half-life is to solve, the question continues.
He answers Mgr. Lenka Vlk.
No legal rules are required to conclude the agreement with the employee - disease.
The qualification agreement is a legal institution managed by the lawyer of work and may be closed between the employer and the employer to ensure the refund of the costs covered by increased or reimbursed employees.
In the health care, however, the pressure is developed to not conclude these agreements in order to ensure the work of health work and not all hospitals at the present time require this Agreement.
In accordance with Law No 95/2004 S., on the submissions of the accommodation and recognition of professional ability and specialized ability to carry out the doctor's, dental doctor and pharmaceut, it is therefore expressly applied that the specialised education is considered to be rebuilding (never as its increase).
This means that the ≥ 75,000 Kh can be concluded according to the law of work only if the costs are achieved at least.
No legislation or obligation to register in specialization.
