Barack Obama gets as the fourth American President of Nobel the price of peace
The American President Barack Obama will come to Norwegian Osla for 26 hours to take the price of Nobel's peace here as the fourth American President in history.
Diplom, medails and checks of $1,4 million will be given outside the exceptional efforts to strengthen the world diplomacy and cooperation between the nations.
The white house boss will come to the Norwegian metropole with Michelle's wife and will have it.
It is first invited to the Nobel Institute, where the first meeting is with the five members of the committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The President couple has a planned meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonjou.
The next afternoon visit will submit the celebration ceremonies to which Obama will carry out pressure assessment.
He gets him as a fourth American president, but it's just the third one who gets the price directly in the office.
The white house has already warned that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when we are concerned.
The President does not want to avoid this topic because he realizes that he is a president who is currently warning in two countries.
A few days ago, military efforts increased by sending further units to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of his critics.
In Obama's ceremonie, it will also receive a golden medail, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech Crowns).
You're going to give the goods, but he's not decided about a particular charity yet.
The chairman's chairman's plan will then take the banket, where there will be a ministerial President and 250 other invitated guests other than the Norwegian King and Queen.
Both of them have made the price more sustainable since the beginning.
For example, he said he felt that he was not worth it fully.
Sometimes he also repeated that it is not just a price for€, but for everyone who seeks the same values as he.
Ihned, after the notice, stated that it was "a call for action".
Protector of nature accused of disorder
The Lithuanian police committed the president of the Civil Association of the Protectors of Nature Litofarice from the exhibition.
In some cases in the next year, he called to some building procedures, requested money from investors for its benefits, the Lithuanian police speaker Alena Romova said that he had been revoked.
The President of the Lithuanian Community of Nature Protectors is Lubomir Studenca.
Now he's in a binding and he's threatening to three years of procedure.
Three containers of Brnu are not much wooled
In Praza, ordinary people can classify the cups of drinks, and you will return to the classic containers on each step.
And in Brna?
That's where you can win a few minutes before you find the fits.
I don't want to say that he wouldn't be classified in Brna.
But I think we are the other biggest city in the Republic, the Councils are insufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest range of waste, not only because as citizens here we can still stick in the classic containers only paper, glass and plastic, but mainly the number of bathrooms for such a waste.
Have you ever tried in the centre, for example, to cut PET lahve into the collection pack?
It's a hot kid, mainly it wants time and strong nerves.
The only place in which I have been on, is on Moya's place towards Poõenee Huse.
Let Mr. Underka not hurt me with my colleagues, but it's gonna come to me a little bit.
I'm not talking about that even in other parts there is no meat classing.
A number of my friends do not classify ra'i so much.
From the league.
They've got it to get away.
I don't wonder to them.
I offered myself in celebration to get out of a few glassed and plastic glasses.
But in the Counic Street, I haven't seen any colored puzzle.
Congratulations, I've gone to the right place.
However, losses have been overtaken.
Well, it's still the center of Brna, which may be the most representative of the city, right?
But the ecological and ecological ethnic is not very interested in the brain socialists.
These towns are going to buy a hokey extraligue, which will make us an accusation throughout the Republic before they bought a few containers more and offered the classing of other sugars for cleaner Brno.
I'm sure I could be able to confirm my opinion after a little brochure on the Internet by the official.
According to the data of the EKO-COM company, the Brno is the most worst in the country of Jihomo.
The "Paroubkovs" budget took money for income and hospitality
After added to agricultors or officers, it must not be in the budget of money for income, disease or building.
However, to the expenditure of the State duty or to the international court.
This will cause problems to those who will rule in the second half of the next year, says the Ministry of Finance of Eduard Janota.
When social democracy and communist increased some groups, they recognized that the government will be more favorable for sensitive expenditure, income or injury. "It is just to resolve problems in the future, min movement," says Janota.
The payment of money is therefore payable to what the costs continue and must sometimes be returned.
It has no power to choose where to take it.
It does not reduce the social doses or costs on the road of the State, it must be taxed.
To all who are now added: to farmers, factors, agricultors.
And let them get their kids.
Income or illness, from which 1,8 billion have lost, people do not have to be afraid, they will be obtained.
However, for the price of the debt to be more debt – the next year will miss only 163 billion, but more.
Although I'm trying to make a minister of Janoty so much for what I'm going on and with him and the costs for the expenditure.
The State will need money for his replacement and will have enough to increase the DPH in the absence of a mother, or to reduce the way the government did in its antideficiency package.
For the movement of money in the benefit of some groups of volunteers, the next year will be missing five billion dollars for the delivery of railways and railways.
It is extremely sustained and dissatisfied incidences that are not to be re-constructed and, where appropriate, not to be re-constructed.
Reserve the highest, which isn't free too.
This means the late or stop of thirty large buildings, and it is also threatened to cover Europe's money, warns the speaker of the Carel Hanzelk Transport Ministry.
The CSSD claimed that the money's wealth would solve blamounsky – it would be a dividend of the CEZ, which is a part of its own, and the transport fund is adequate.
The problem is that the higher division is never sure, and it's no longer an unusual source.
Loni was attached from CHEZ to the budget of 18 billion.
Ecological damages are applied each year from the dividend, the investment is added or served as a reserve for the lack of income reform.
Moreover, this trick is increased by the EU rules of budget at 5.7 per cent of HDP.
Yet, the carnival of the moves will not end.
At least three billion have been in the budget for different frauds by the victim of communism and criminal acts or for the expenditure of courts, even for building.
If it's going out without that money, it's not sure.
It's lottery.
If we lose a international dispute, we'll have to pay it the same, Janota states.
The Minister will then have to protect the money within the resort or in the worst case to the government budget reserve.
Hundred million are also missing a two-milyard project of State assets to enable online monitoring which individual authorities lose.
The stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance doesn't find money anywhere else, the project should be stopped, the sanction comes, he warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
Americans in the future compute with a mobile phone on which the holder will press one button to switch between different operating systems.
The discovered plans are promised.
Successfully pressed one key and with Windows Mobile you're transferring to Android during a few seconds.
Exactly this option is deployed by the American VMware company's target, which is focused mainly on the development of a computeralising software.
We'll allow you to carry two mobile profiles once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into house and work.
Both will work at the same moment, Srinivas Krishnamurti from the VMware company in a conversation for computer magazineworld.
He was reviewed in November of the latest year and was first predicted a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not a fixe.
VMware has successfully transmitted the test pattern to smartphone with two operating systems.
It was modified by Nokia N800 with memory of 128 MB RAM, which at the same time runs the Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The new job for mobile phones is completely running.
The VMware firm now cooperates with European and American operators for the testing of smartphone analysis and to the clients should have devices during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains suffers hotels
Holy chests don't care only for crochets.
The missing snow also reflects people from negotiating lyer habitats in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, there are still free rooms at all winter terms in the Krknoş and Silvestra.
We have a big visit on our pages.
People's giving offers, discovering prices, but then they're scared to negotiate.
And if they call to us, they immediately ask if we think we're going to be the aeroplane on the snow or on the blue," introduced the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants silvestrv lives in Spindler, exactly according to his imagination, he wouldn't have been able to wear with a negotiation anymore.
Whoever gives the priority of money support and the quality of housing is use to the other place, he can still try to wait for a few days.
Spindler's hotels are still offered to Silvestra only weekly apartments.
I think they'll try to hit them for a while, but then they'll let them go and go for a shorter time.
And then there will be free rooms to live," Jandura recalled.
The free bowl in all winter terms still offers a superlab road and an Ingtours office.
Now we're most interested in the winter week that's not sold yet.
A half of the places in our offer remains free.
That's why we've already had a lower winter residence for the last moment," said manager Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in Krkonoşhes can offer the high-scale road also, but free spaces are less.
It's good to stay for the first fourteen days in February, the rest of the winter terms is sold directly.
For years, the interest of the worst residence affects negatively that there is still no snow in the Krkonesh.
People's waiting if they're attacking.
No one wants to take the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
They will be snippet during the week, and they will also be sold by Christmas," Mr. Schiefert.
On the contrary, something better than the wlone is able to contain Horizont's hotel rooms in Peci under Snow.
We're about five percent better.
We have the last few places at Silvestra and Christmas.
The big interest is on Poland's vacuums in January and well sells the Sunday," reported the director of the best peck hotel of Karel Rada.
From eighteen percent, the silvestrov habitats are occupied and the Omnia hotel at the central park in Janské Lazne.
On the contrary, on Wednesday, there remains a half of the lips of freedom in the latest January hotel.
It's a pleasure to surprise us for years of ice, which we've already been occupied about sixty per cent at this time.
It's a little weaker at the time, but when the snow attacks, the interest of the living in the Krkonoş's certainly still stands, the director of Omnia Erik Sporysch's hotel.
However, on the highest snow, cross-country hotels have to be able to be stuck.
On Thursday, it's to be covered, if there's a snow, then there should be snow on the mountains.
But then he has to come back to the warmth, informed Jirá Jakubski from the Czech Hydrometheorological Institute.
USA: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
It's comic, with the Barack Obama School Employment, the President with the most discreet story, repeated in the Afghanistan question of his pre-government strategy, which he himself has put for the most stupid.
When he finally expelled his expected afghanick doctrine, it was shown that he described it through a copy of the Iraq scenario from Bush three years ago.
Not only in the same text uses sometimes the wordwork "as in Iraq", but he does not even weigh to use the name of Bush's declaration from January 2007 as the name of his own holding: "New Road forward".
Thus, three years ago, he criticized Bush's idea to send the red military positions to Iraq as "unresponsibility and in his successive disaster decisions".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush's strategy resulting from the recommendation of the police leaders was my only and so much successful that today, in reporting reports about Iraq, no matter what is happening.
The bush's reputation did not decline, but objektively left his representative much more grateful outcome than it could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is again.
For the increase in the military continent, the police leaders asked him again, especially the top of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the subordinational exhibition, criticized the weighty shooter in the White House.
He asked for 40 thousand men to be able to break off the better.
The president was weakening three months, but he didn't have anything better, so at least he destroyed the general by 10 thousand soldiers.
In Europe, he was able to pursue the promises of five thousand, even though he had a number of at least 10.
The most difficult at the entire Strategy of Obam seems to be his purpose to begin downloading armies from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process in three years. The whole Obam's doctor calls more questions than answers.
Many doubt that half increases give the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Although the Iraq company has been relatively well arranged during the last years of the brotherhood war, her leaders respect the agreement.
The Afghanistan's characteristic is the opposite sign - no one can be delayed and no agreements are undertaken.
These submines are wrongly prepared by the Afghanistan security forces usually to change the gentlemen according to what they do.
Political institutions, even though they are formally based, will remain only a polycaric village for which patriarchal generations will continue to be built.
The development of the interests of different ethnic groups is usually complicated in view of the independence of the circumstances that are more complicated by Pakistan and Iranian influences.
Not even the building of the "acceshop State", which is the minimalistic target of the whole operation, does not seem too real.
The time horizon of Obam's strategy will prohibit his voluntaryism.
In the past eight years, the exhibition in Afghanistan was only harmful, and now they are on explosion.
Trusting that the soldiers send to the warfare for the "fast return to home" cause a miracle here, can only be romantic, unattracted soul.
Politically, the statement of data of the station of Armies is clearly unresponsibility, because the Taliban will be aware of it as an indirect recognition of the American destruction.
The final summit of the NATO showed that the Europeans are willing to perform war operations in Afghanistan.
European policies do not want to explain to their electors how the safety of Germany or Italy relates to war in the submarine of Hindukusche.
Another factor that can radically enter into the ration is the development of the event around Iran.
If the situation continues to be harmful and the injured sanction on Iraq, the issue will be raised before the United States, whether they are not trying to solve the problem with military force.
It will be necessary to reply to her at the time that Obama adds America to the winning download from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean dramatic turnover in Afghanistan.
The only payment for Barack Obam is that for three years the presidential elections will remain, so it remains still enough to come with other strategies if this is shown as a total disaster.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will have no recompense in preparation
High leaders of the United States Banks Goldman Sachs will not be given in the year of recompense in preparation.
She announced that the company that so reacts to the criticism of its earlier practices.
The group of 30 main managers will receive an action money that will be sold first in five years.
Moreover, the action may be rejected to the managers if they are too strictly risked.
Goldman Sachs, according to the agency Reëves, is putting into the head of an attempt to connect a recompense to Wall Street with a time of performance.
I believe that Wall Street is a good way for the larger direction to be issued by the former investment banker to JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Bank Goldman Sachs became the third criticist after the first three quarter of the year was given to its side at approximately 17 billion dollars (only 300 billion Kč).
The total expenditure in the business for an aeroplane according to the Agency Re·s, obviously, has over 20 billion dollars, despite the currently reported measure.
High refunds in the banking sector have become a political issue in many countries with the financial crisis incoming.
In the center, British reported that the valuable bonuses of bankers exceeding 25,000 litres (which 712,000 Kč) would unilaterally be charged with 50 percent of taxes.
It also prepares France on the basis of these steps.
Years of women obtained Nobel's price in all areas other than physical
The five recorded women today in Stockholm were transferred from the hand of the Swedish King Carla XVI. Gustafa aircraft Nobel prices in professional categories and debt.
Nearly four of them was the German writer of Herta M.
The nobel price for medical treatment was obtained by two American biocarbons Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider together with their country Jack Šostake for research in Chromosomes.
The chemical price was given by the Israelian Ada Jonath together with the American Vencatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitzem for the explanation of the structure and the fishooms.
The last laureat had Nobel's price for the economy that the American Elinor Ostrom and her country Oliver Williamson received for the economic management analysis.
The only professional category that was running without a holder for years was physical.
Today, the Charles Kao students have taken this price for research in the optical flakes, and George Holyth with Willard Boyl for finding the CCD chip, which is based on all digital cameras, faxs or astronomical remote views.
Each evaluated took a diploma, Nobel medal and a certificate for the benefit of the financial refund.
In each category there are ten millions of Swedish crowns (25 million Kč).
There are more in each of them, the reward is divided between themselves.
Traditionally unexpected Nobel's price for peace has already been received this afternoon in Norwegian Osla, President Barack Obama.
In his manifestation, he recognized the controversity of his assessment, because it is just at the beginning of his roads and also stands in the head of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
However, in the context of its policy, he added that wars are certainly necessary for the elimination of peace, although the price for this is high.
Mr. Janota's deputy.
President Václav Klaus will accept on Friday the Ministry of Finance of Eduard Janot, which considers the detention in the government, because it does not agree with the likeness of the State budget for the next year as it was approved in the middle of the Missionary Summit.
It is assumed that the budget and may also Janoto's arrest in the cabinet will be the subject of their Friday meetings.
The start also criticizes Klaus.
According to the deficit, it has too high deficit, which continues to disturb public funding crisis.
He informed the President's speaker Radim Ogvat about the meeting.
Janota wants to act on Monday with Prime Minister Jane Fischer.
According to the budget law, which now will receive Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic would have to operate with 163 billion crowns.
However, in the middle of the middle, it agreed only to move money and increased the money for the payment of the national employees, the operation of social services and the direct payment for farmers.
The government expressed social democracy's proposals that they visit the budget steps.
The Left between one and the Government, Klaus and the rights on the other side, has resulted in an easily intrapolitical disturbance that causes the questionnaire to address the next action of the Fischer's Official Cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed on the border.
Criticals claim that the budget as it was accepted, in fact, eliminates the package of the sustainable measures that the Government of Fischer has sent down and which is to stop the State debt according to it.
Klaus, who can, but also not have to sign the State budget law, on today's debates with the undertaking, stated that the political policies had deployed a longer time "severe problem", which is "intainable deficiency" of public funds.
It's not a good solution now.
Increasing could only bring a strong government, which could also deal with a larger consensus of political parties, Minor President.
President ODS Mirek Topolanek stated that the budget is terrible and the government should consider further existences.
The President of the ODS Petr often said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CHSSD, ODS and green none more works.
The Prime Minister Fischer in response marked similar words as "fortunate words".
Chief CHSSD Jiří Paroubek on Topolanka reacted that the fearful is the stage of the budget that the former Topolankov Government prepared for this year and which exceeds 200 billion crowns.
The CSSD has already indicated the approval of the State budget for the next year for success.
The people were also happy.
Mandel's played Morgan Freeman in Clinta Eastwood's newspaper.
South African people claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The unexplained speaks to the world much about the earth, its fights and victories, despite some criticisms, the major role of American hercs is being made.
The past reports about sports, racial conditions and Nelson Mandel.
The unnamed fight against the racist regime of apartheid in the South African Republic and its first black president Nelson Mandel in his life story represents a protective American heritage Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela asked him if he could create him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role in it plays Matt Damon.
I said to him, 'When I'll play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The twenty-five-year herd, who had received a price for the role in Eastwood Drama from the box Million ́ Baby, created for example a leader of moving for the destruction of the slave, from which, finally, became a slave, a fiktiv president of the United States and even a god in God’s Evano, but only rarely someone who lives and is so important for many people as Mandela.
An ancient South African Stateman was 27 years in practice for his active work for the end of the apartheid in the South African Republic.
The freedom was released in 1990, and then four years he became the president of the country.
In 1993, Nobel's price for peace was appointed.
Invictus is a Latin word for unconscious, and it is the name of the basically English author of William Ernesta Henley issued in 1875.
The call was to talk like him.
The picture is a real story of how Nelson Mandela joined powers with the South African ragby team of France Pinik to help join the country. The new election president Mandela knows that his nation remains still racial and economically divided after the apartment.
He believes that his people can connect through sport, so he will decide to join rags players who belong to a worldwide measure between outsides.
Finally, the South African team is to the World Future of 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years in order to get Mandel's story on the plague.
I had no other goal than playing this role so that I could draw it closer to the most real, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to talk like him.
Heric said that if he and the world policy were from the same side, he would try to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be in prison before his manifestation.
It's the most important thing that Mandel wanted to screw his hands.
I tried to try that when I printed your hand, I embraced your energy, it's transferred, and I felt that I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to get with another person.
Matt Damon creates Françoise Pinner's movie, a national ragby team in which the white players were transferred.
Heric said he had six months to prepare for a role in the strong world of ragby.
The great surprise for the end was when he first met Pinner in his house.
I'm trying to see how I called to the house of a sound, he opened me and the first thing I said to François Pinner in my life was, "I look much more in the movie."
Despite evident divisions in herc positions in comparison with their respective proposals under the management of Eastwood Registry, Invictus received: The unusual positive recessions and also talk about ambitions in Oscar.
The film criticism of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy shrinked its evaluation in words: "He was a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com sites, Invictus received 76 percent of positive evaluations.
Secret of Sea over Norway resolved: Russians tested the racket
On Norway, it was possible to observe the special light effect of an unknown powder.
The Russian Ministry of Defence just yesterday admitted that near Norwegian borders had tested intercontinental Baltic Rake.
But the start was again an insufficient and shooted as the type "Bulava", which would have been a p'ep-chlory of the Russian Armies, quickly becomes the black sea of Russian generals and the Premier Vladimir Putina.
Not even his repeated presence in the racket tests had an effect on the success of the experimental aeroplanes.
The bulava hasn't flighted or hurted in the air.
In the Russian news, "Bulava" is already written as a "racket that doesn't fly."
The racket that's not flying but the light
This trial has already been 13 times in order to start normally.
By the end of the year, the apparatus was recovered by the technical damage.
Apparently the engine exploded in the third degree of the cancer.
This time, "Bulava" started from the atomic poor Dmitri Donski, which rained under the winter of the White Sea.
This type of racket allows the shooting of the ships that are in movement and at the same time deteriorated.
That is why it is likely that a mysterious light caused by Norway nearly a flightless object was deceived by "Bulava".
The rest of Norwegians had no doubt about the Russian racket since the first time.
The generals are warning this time and claim that they can't speak individually of failure.
Two degrees of rackets have been held and the accident has reached up to the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately in the first degree.
Although no test start was completely running without failure, the Ministry of Defense is able to lead only six of the thirty.
Thus, nearly fifty percent of succeeding generally fills optimism and thus still states that "Bulava" will be flying without problems and that it even brings up to ten hypersensitive nuclear blocks with the maximum total weight of 1,15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed in 51 years of a year with CSKA Moskva
The Legendary defense of Vjačeslav Fetisov will be represented again in professional hokey distress in 51 years.
The former world master, the Olympian winner and the holder Stanley Cupu will help in his team CSKA Moskva and, obviously, takes the KHL against Peter.
Fetisov, who ended the career for 40 years in 1998, is currently the President of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljash hurt, we need to have another department.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed that he would help the team.
We just need to resolve the formal advantages, the AP Agency's Moscow Club Sergei Germany.
There is still no way if the comeback of the celebrated hokejith is only one storage.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lead the spirit of the final players, introduced Germans.
Fetisov, according to the AP, becomes the oldest Russian professional hokeyit.
In NHL, he played the entire season for Hartford, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe, and added to 15 and 26 assistants.
The oldest five of Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hokeists of history.
In the Soviet Church, he received two olympics gold, seven titles of the world's master, triumphed on the Canadian Cupu and the Youth World Shampionate.
In the second part of his career, he assembled success in NHL, where he bought over Stanley Cup in the deck of Detroit.
Since 2001, the Hokey Sina is a member of the glory.
Hyundai called to the committees. He cancels all overtimes
The driving of the Hyundai car has agreed with the committees to distort all overtimes.
The committees were reported on Monday for a period of time.
He confirmed that Hyundai Peter Vanek's speaker car.
However, the leadership wants to agree with the officers on another aeroplane change.
We can't repeat our production plan, it's essential, so it was proposed a volunteer for a long time in the Sabbath 19, with two changes, said Vanique.
Server Seven.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Sabbath exchanges offered bonus 400 Kč.
The people will get back for the work on the Sabbath on November 28.
The company, according to Vaňka, decided to change the way of motivation of employees for the time proposed.
Or let them pay a payment for a period of time or they can choose a replacement free 28.
Furthermore, all employees will receive a payable feet and dinner.
In the light of the most urgent and burning points, as regards the advancement and the disturbance of the staff, and the protesting employees, which have stopped the production last week, so the management of the last afternoon has decided with the immediate validity of the elimination of all transitional periods for the month of the month, once Vaňak said.
Car employees were required practices every day after eight-hour changes to work for two hours ago.
After signing the agreement, the committee shall revoke the staff accommodation
Next negotiation between car and experts shall be performed on Friday afternoon.
The Boss of the Committees Peter Kuchař in the middle said that if they agree to comply with the requests and sign the common document, they are prepared to cancel the staff's preparation.
The situation in the car was discovered last week in the middle of 400 employees spontaneously for inconsistent passports.
They also protested against bad payment and data shicking.
The leader stated that the employees had to do sometimes in order to comply with the requests for car supply.
In their monthly announcement, the officers also requested that none of the sanctions have been achieved by employees who were interrupted by the middle of the production.
During the period of time, the committee requests the company to reduce the transitional work to minimum.
Moreover, they want to pay a 5000 crown in the year.
Hyundai's car is now employing 2000 people.
With the same production, the company split down in November.
In the airport, it produced a total of 80,000 vehicles, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars annually.
Czech Revelation: Substance that also kills HIV virus
The Czech and German team tests new associations that can reduce the width of HIV in the body.
The advantage of the improved substance is that it is that it also takes the viruses that have already been obtained against immune medicinal products.
This fact in some cases is overwhelming that the association with the virus variance does not affect as strong as some of the medicines already available.
AIDS disease cannot be treated yet.
However, the patient may prolong the lives of medicines that prevent HIV-virus multiplication in the body.
Their use, however, takes a number of neighbourhoods.
Furthermore, the incomplete treatment of virus multiplication is the resulting development of resistant viruses, contrary to which medicines are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three academy’s institutions and the WHCHT Praha and the university in Heidelberg opens the way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that metal carbonate substances are responsible for the HIV-virus multiplication.
Metacarboranas are associated with bottle, water, carbon and cobalt.
These associations block the width of the virus other than all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistence.
In their work, they are joined with new ‘building’ associations prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their liabilities on the virus white.
Metacarboranas have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-dimensional atomy atomy, hydrocarbon and carbon are connected to the coffee atom, in this case cobalt.
Sweet and odolated virus
HIV protease is HIV-virus protease, which is necessary for life cycle.
Without HIV protease of HIV-virus hepatitis, an increased infection viral part would not be eliminated.
When we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the width of virus in the patient body, they explain in the print report issued by the Organic Chemical and Biochemia Institute of Academy and CR.
In the work published in the periodic Journal of Medical Chemistry, they describe a series of associations in which two pairs of clothes (see table) are connected to a short organic row that is further systematicly modified.
Something worse, but more comfortable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease has been tested in the scrutiny and also against its resistent (resistance) variants obtained from HIV virus patients.
The effect of metalocarboranas on an enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but their effect of non-effective effect on resistant variants against which the medicines are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of the incidence and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical adjustments, so from metalocarboranas, makes interesting associations for further research relating to HIV medicines, Pauline Rezach, structural biological laboratories of organic chemical and biochemical genetic establishment and Academia.
It's hard for the budget. The ODS left to Fischer, that's preventing.
Boss ODS Mirek Topolanek marked the approved budget for the next year for "free" and the Government of Prime Minister Jana Fischer should consider further existences.
The ODS review signed the President of the Government as a strong statement.
He leaves time for an analysis.
The President of the ODS Petr sometimes said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Pages is apparently not functioning.
The President of the Government must, according to sometimes, decide whether it is determined to deal with a minority against a growing deficit, whether it is to remain in a position by Parliament.
ODS access and social democracy to public deficit problems is diameterly different, warned sometimes.
In the middle, the budget was adopted for 2010, but with the left amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
Increasing money for the payment of national employees, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Great Government at the address of social democracy was the fact that they visited the budget steps.
CHR should economy with 163 billion corners.
The ODS went out of the Salle before voting, and claimed that the government's desire that the changed budget is also less wrong than the budgetary provision.
Disappointment and martyrship
Ministry of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of the disappointment and feeling of marvelousness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer stated that the Government was still aware.
Sometimes it is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened the decline in the case of the amendments, it could look different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota was negotiated on Monday after the government to the Premier.
He also indicated that he considers another detention in Âa.
D'em is his disappointment from the budget negotiation.
Fischer is expressed for the further fight against the budgetary rates, they do not, according to the Government, do not do the nominators of the CSSD, which has made changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say that it gives demision, if it accepts further deficit deficiency, such as those relating to disease, income, or a new service law.
Topolar: ODS nomination ministers have not been provoked
It's the case of the Minister of Fischer and the entire government.
The ODS nomination ministers did not do anything wrong, explained Topolanek in the US text report.
He recalled that several ministerial offices were reported to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Sometimes he highlighted that if Fischer decides to resume the principle of fighting with the higher public funds, "is absolutely logical and correct that he is in the right hands of the leftness that is currently in the snow."
Then it can't count with the support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's current, I'll do this, he said to the journalists in the strictly defense minister of Martin Barták, who was just the citizens of democracy in the government.
The Prime Minister Fischer sold the afternoon to the European Council's negotiations to Brussels.
The ODS premises requested
At the same time, he highlighted that the ODS would, in the middle of the meantime, vote against the modified budget, if the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats would not expressly request that the budget should be accepted.
We don't look as a poor, we're not small children, but we're response to the question whether the ODS has not reached the presence of the president in Parliament and the Czech Republic in the political negotiation of the budget.
I didn't notice my voice would miss.
Since I had given up the mandate, I felt that in the next months, it was going to be about the snippets and the destruction of all the positive, Topolanek himself responded.

The JAR's arrival relates to everyone, Morgan Freeman Alias Mandela
In the next days, a new Hollywood film comes to the American cinema, Clinta Eastwooda Invictus (official name in Czechish sounds Invictus: Non-conscient), who has a part of the life story of the former president of the South African Republic of Nelson Mandely.
The role of a worldwide fight against the apartment was deceived by Morgan Freeman, whom he had chosen for his creation for years ago.
The main man's role of the Legendary South African campaign in the French Piniker's rugby, Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film into the cinema from the voices of criticism and publicity
Nelson Mandela
The whole name of Nelson Rolihla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 he received Sacharov's price for the freedom of thinking, and in 1993 with de Klerke Nobel the price of peace.
The President of the South African Republic was 1994-1999.
a great expectation because it comes to the public at the time in which the South African Republic, however, is up to the world championship in the Balaam, but the media also reveal anxious report on the growing racial hatred and discrimination of people from the Black Government.
According to the reporting agency AP, new movies in JAR are to move throughout the world, even through the lightweights of the main role of Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is, according to his words, a new movie is fierce.
I dreamed about that role for long years and prepared for it well.
For many times I also met Nelson Mandela personally to - as it is said - enhanced his energy, introduced in a discussion after the celebration of the film's celebration in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandel's personality and message.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it's about everybody, added.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The picture based on the low proposals of the British writer John Carlin with freely translated name In the enemy role: Nelson Mandela and the game that has given the nation to emerge portrait the South African human rights detention during his first presidential election period.
Thus, through the film, Morgan Freeman is trying to smile two races and after a long years along the population groups, as well as in 1995, Nelson Mandela, he also enters into the Hercean role in the South African national rugby dress on the world's fire, which JAR then wins.
For the incoming to a tree in a dress, which is captained in JAR as such as the sanctuary, Mandela switched a big sheep overwhelmingly white public and obtained the recognition of the white population.
The Football Mystery may be able to reconnect people to one nation, introduced the Chester Williams rugby player, who was the only "swarm" in the National Team in 1995.
If the pressure in JAR is improved, it will be shown first.
However, the white South African are skeptics, for example, in a recent conversation for LN, the Christopher Dawson's race, who fled from the country to British.
Championate shall be completed on 11 June 2010.

It contains six units in the fire, according to the speaker of Luka Marvan's national farmers.
P'employed farmers wanted to leave the transformer burning, but the view was overwhelmed and fire washing water mixtures, dogs and special hazardous substances.
The reason was the technical commitment, the internal crash of the transformer.

Jančura provides a criminal notice for the negotiation of three leaders from the CSSD
Major Student of Agency Radim Jančur is presenting a sentence notice of three social-democracy leaders.
And it's on Michala Haška from Jihomo's country, Radko Martínka from the Pardubian country and the leader of the Olomouck country of Martin Tesarek.
Janchura's introduced it in 20 minutes of radio magazine.
Injury relates to the efforts of companies to operate regional heat transport in some countries.
However, all regions finally signed with the Czech loves.
All three leaders are attacking us and talking about the choice of breakfast, and we offered a offer only for what they wanted.
They say we're less than the Czech Roads, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech Drags that have been closed last week.
So we don't need to protect him.
It's for a talk about the Student Agency, said to the Jančur Radio Journal.
It also stated that it had evidence from all countries that they did not have their steps in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares for the European Commission.
The case of the sentence of a criminal notice considers further continuation of the media show of Mr. Jančury, which serves him as an unpaid advertising of his company and his own person.
I'm understandingly ready to get my good name and my country and to the same call and the final leaders.
I assume that, even in this occasion, Mr Jančura will show that it is just the one who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the area of regional railway transports, has introduced Hashek.
Janchura has noted that he has invested a few million crowns in the public, which will warn about the inadequate step of the countries.
The radiojournal said the campaign after birthdays would be broken and wanted to continue in it after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be led against corruption like those.
The campaign started Jančura after that the countries agreed on the operation of regional railway connections with the Czech loves and on the prohibition of approximately 150 billion crowns had no tenders.
According to Jančury, it is like an anti-legal negotiation and in contrast with the opinion of the European Court.
For the criticism of the impact transport in the countries, Jančur had also threatened the lawyer to the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we can come to the bus license.
He represented himself as a lawyer of the CSSD, I know what the lady is about, I won't say his name, he said to the Radio Journal of Jančur today.
Waiting against pneumatics will be free and unfaithful
Waiting against pneumoks from January will be a fresh severity.
It must be the first for families free and equally unfaithful.
But the vote has already been appealed that it would be more obligation to expect.
Preparations for the introduction of free expectation against pneumatics.
The pharmaceutical body already defines the maximum price of vaccine that pays health insurance.
The experts have also been in the process of expectation.
New expectation
Vacuums free for slaughter children
Since January, children who were born on August 2 and after may be freely covered against pneumatics.
The submine is that there is no one of the expectation dose yet.
Whoever has started to shoot the hall or before, he must be arrested by himself and another surprise.
The expectation dose should be given between 3 and 5 months of child.
She voluntaryly allowed her children to stand against pneumokoks, a quarter of the family.
Instead, parents paid 1600 corners for one dose and more.
For the youngest children, four doses need to be expected.
In general, experts consider that health insurance issues 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year.
But the door is on the treatment that children would need without waiting.
Today, for all the flat expectations of children, he gave about 500 thousand per year.
The threatened expectation was introduced by the Janot Package.
Pneumokok causes middle ears deterioration, but also serious infections, including brain bleeds and blood greenhouse.
At pneumokok infection, we will die for a year according to monitoring in illnesses up to 28 children to 10 years.
Furthermore, the Czech Republic has introduced a wide range of children's expectations against pneumokoks cca in 40 countries.
Is the waiting obligation?
However, the views of the future could be binding for this expectation.
From January, it must be deteriorated by security and uncertainty.
That it would be obligation to wait better, for example, the Chief of the Civil Association of Nalas Rudolf Kalovski.
His association of pneumokok vaccine has been propagating at a time.
The international experts, which have been associated, have not been completely agreed with our voluntary expectations.
It's not perfectly ideal.
On the other hand, we believe that it has been able to make at least this.
I think that's the way we have to stop now, he introduced Kalovski.
The Ministry of Health but does not want to change the process of waiting against pneumatics.
At this moment, we don't think about that, said his speaker Vlastimil Srsenj.
Volunteer expectation has its accidents, strong doctors
Chairman of the Professional Society of Practical Children’s Children’s Dr. Hana Cabrnoch recognises that he has a voluntary expectation of his failure.
If all children were deceived, it could be considered to be decreased by the number of overviews, "When this vaccine is so high, we understand the political decision that the expectation was restarted as voluntary," says Cabrnoch.
Professors expect that their beauty may be allowed to stand against pneumokoks since the next year more than 80 percent of fresh parents.
The expectation of pneumoks is adequate, even in the fact that as the first flat expectation of the child, it is not a health security.
Insurance should be issued for prevention, it takes further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy their own substances.
However, it relates to the care of practical children’s doctors relating to vaccine purchasing.
According to the pp, vaccines should have purchased insurance and doctors would have achieved them as the state added to their final expectations.
Some Members, however, feared that the security could be "leaving money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to purchase and wait until they are insurance.
According to estimates, children’s individual practices will invest in vaccine 40 thousand per month, which is a significant amount.
It's not going to be easy, Cabrnoch says.
The son of the American Artist 's furnished in Museum'
The son of the renamed American creation fantastic Frank Frazetta was accused of the trial of 20 million dollars of his father's museum.
The police in Pennsylvania noted that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was approved to put 90 images into his vehicle and carrying.
The named Mr. Frazetta and the other man used to enter the museum in the region of Poconco Mountains bagr.
Mr. Frazetta senior, age 81, celebrated the establishment of Barbara Conana and Tarzana.
At the time that it happened, the artist came on Florida, as the printing agency introduced Press.
The AP cited the named police officer, who said that Mr. Frazetta was younger to be motivated to act by enduring family disputes.
Before police, Mr. Frazetta issued a younger jury statement, 52 years old, that he had so effected on his father's order, "to get to Museum any possible way and move images into the sweet room", as the Agency said.
Mr. Frazetta's senior has deployed any authorisation as the Agency has introduced.
Labouriste prevents planned tax growth
The ministries have deployed the increase in the tax and reduction of the expenditure notified in the preliminary report on the budget against the criticism of opposition, businesses and committees.
As Alistair Darling said, Tory's "promarninini" option to show that he thinks seriously delaying decisions on deficit reduction to time after elections.
Even the Officer has reached the hall for the low and medium income income.
According to its opinion, the growth of 0.5 % in social insurance is mainly increased and 1 % of the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Resolution on social insurance
The Committees protested that workers with low income were deceived for the recession they did not blame and warned before "problems".
The social insurance increases - the growth makes approximately 3 billion billion billion billion billion per year - which has enhanced the community of employees who have noticed that it is a tax from employment, while it should be to renew the economic.
This increase, which limits these incomes more than 20000 litres per year, will touch approximately 10 million workers.
Key BODY PBR
Social insurance is increased by additional 0,5 % from April 2011
Economy is worse than expected, by 4,75 % in this year
New delivery of 50 % of bankers' bonuses
Increasing 1% by fire for repeats in small fires
Decreases for electricity and electrical electricity
Increasing income ratio by 2,5 %
According to the assessment of the State financial administration, some 30000 litres are reduced by 90 litres per year and some 40000 lires are reduced by 190 litres while some 10000 litres are increased by 110 litres.
The Ministers noted that their deficit reduction target was "complete decisions" until 2013, but that 60 % of special taxes should be covered by 5 % of persons with the highest income.
The Ministry of Finance Stephen Timms noted that the increase in tax and cost limits would be "cape in the ocean" in comparison with what would be necessary.
"They're a big number, which allows us to reduce deficit to half, which you're absolutely basic request for the following four years," BBC reported.
Mr. Timms concluded that he is convinced that economic growth should be reached at the past of the year.
But the development of prognoses for future economic growth - which will affect the amount of necessary money and how deficit will be decreased - must be broken in the road after the Office was brought to the review of previous amounts.
In the general set, the economic reduction in this year was about 4,75% - far worse than 3,5%, predicted in April - because the contributions were 3 billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billions higher than previously considered.
Periodic opportunity '
Conservatives who started a new propagation campaign, warning against the "Dependence Crisis", marked a planned credit of 789 billion frees during the next six years for an unusual.
The Ministers failed to present a plan for a time-based plan, adding that the "chiness" had made this decision until the time of the elections - which must be passed until June 2010.
"They have not added anything significant to be performable," said Philip Hammond's finance minister. "They had the possibility to do it, but they've lost it."
"All important notifications will be made by elections if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labouriste's market is that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from the future treasures in the division of the Tory's deficiencies, which would want to reduce the deficit and in the greatest range.
However, the Liberal Democrats claim that money obtained by increased tax and reduction of expenditure should be used to support expenditure in the next year and not to reduce deficit, and they claim that the plans are "placed on fish".
The political commenter BBC Nick Robinson reported about the time of notification - for example, the above inflation increases and will reach the incapacity of dozen payments in April next - that it could lead to the accusation of officers in the election campaign, if money would be able to get hardly back for a year of delay.
However, the markets to provide special assistance if people will need them very much and the revision will be revised on September 2010.
Subsequent budget
Although ministers did not publish the expenditure details after 2011, the economics noticed that the reduction of public expenditure would only be the beginning of the average limitations.
The recognised Budget Studies Institute notified that Office numbers indicate basic figures in many areas, potentially include transport, high education and defence in the building.
"It's still very painful," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come to the elections, if we win them," added Roger Bootle, the economic adviser of Deloitte revisors.
"This was a report of the subsequent preliminary budget.
The FBI's conducting investigations in the "American Conferences in Pakistan"
The FBI conducts investigations in Pakistan at the five Americans, subjected to extremists.
The men were imprisoned for an attack on the house in Sargoda in the East Pandżab province, as BBC reported to the American Majesty in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was an investigation, whether it was the same men who were announced that they were inconscient in their lives in the United States of Virginia last month.
The American Ministry of Employment concluded that it was also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are stated that they are a p'of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian preachers and the final entertainment of Jemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would really be interested in what submines they were arrested and in what circumstances they were staying there," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The Language FBI Katherine Schweit reported that the agency was informed of prison and was contacted with the families of sinned students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistan authorities, and they determined their identity and the power of their start here and whether there is one of the sinned students," she said.
The Pakistanian Majesty in Washgington indicated that men were arrested in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of them.
The house was in the middle of the local police interest, and it wasn't yet an accusation against arrested men.
The Ministry rejected Hillry Clinton's comments on arrests, reported the printing agency Re日s, but she noted that the United States had to "co-operate a lot of areas with Afghanistan and Pakistan in discovering the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and training persons".
The avoidance of these five students from the house in North Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejecting amnestie for Iranian tirans.
The situation in the maintenance of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, as reported by Amnesty International.
The report detailedly describes the "throughs of torture" in the regime before and after the contrary presidential elections in June.
One of the men indicated that he was bathed and burned by cigarettes, and another indicated that he was threatened by violence.
The Iran has rejected the criticism of this report on the maintenance of human rights.
The officials marked this critical as a politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were arrested and decades were killed after the constant election of President Mahmuda Ahmadinežadad, which led to the greatest street democracy from the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
For tens of them, the commitment was deprived, and the complaints judged the last five persons to death.
The BBC writer in Teheran John Leyne, who is now located in London, noted that the highest leader of Ajatolah Ali Commejní previously announced the unrighteousness of some ways of torture and prohibited their conduct in Karizak.
But since that time, no legal power critics have been tolerated, as our writer introduced.
Injust recognition
Amnesty International cited a message of the 26-year student of the college of Ibrahim Methari, which indicated that he was accused of "working Facebook networks" and protests against election results.
"Freely they were in my face," he said in the responsibility.
"They burned me by cigarettes under the eyes, on the head, and threatened me by the correction and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half in unconsciousness, Amnesty introduced.
In August, the presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after protests and was encouraged to die and the finals were violated.
The Iranian higher State officers have committed a consequence of violation, but they have admitted that it has been wrong to torture.
Amnesty also introduced the case of an earlier, which indicated that he was held in the container with 75 other persons for a period of more than eight weeks in Kahrizak.
Amnesty believed that the Iranian Parliament and Justice had established committees for the investigation of authorised concerns and reactions of the Government, but she noted that the mandates and powers of the authorities were unexpected and that the findings of the parliamentary committees were required to be published.
The group noted that at least 90 persons were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the town Park, a swimming swimming was created
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to change the memory in Bristol in the Chessing Road for Travel.
The Conference Road for the park was added to 16 halfprofessional lingeries and snowboardists to concurrerate financial prices.
On the top of the cheese roads in the Brandon Hill Park, there was a short shock town before 100 m of the cheese road.
The student of the fourth year of the medical John Hickman said that it was a wonderful look from the top of the seasonary roads, but that's just a rare point.
It was a wonderful view of the town's spectacular light down.
There were some of the best snowboarders and snowboardists in the whole country -- some of them are talents," added.
The prices were made for the best cups - or manevrs on the square roads.
After the quarter dinner dinner, the snow was left to spread.
Stay on them and me
Can he be a Muslim of France?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secondary state.
During the time when the Swiss electors called after the prohibition of the construction of minerals and generally broadcast reports about the data islamization of Europe, John Bowen, the American academy wrote and informed and thought about whether the Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrated - to one of the most uninterpretated secondary companies of the continent.
Some readers, after reading this book, became surprises of the authors of the last work, "Why don't the French have no heads" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on the difficult issues that are divided and employed by the country for 15 years and whose impacts are still feeling today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has a larger and ambitionary record.
As a good antropologist, he wants not only to realize what politicians and media have said about islam in France, but what happened in the basis.
He has spent all months in mixtures, schools and institutions, which are now concerned about 5 - 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic Chambers".
He's a good listener, plays debates between students and students about questions that are most concerned.
Should I have to enter into a woman's bond in a mixture or in a worker (or in both places)?
Should the young Muslim be learned about the development and gay rights?
Can the Muslim take a look for a man who is not Muslim?
Has Muslim the right to use interestingly oriented bank system if you want to get a hypoteque?
These are probably the world's controversy issues that are discussed, which are part of everyday life more than the political drama that works for media.
The author identifies a new generation of names, artists and intellectuals, among other generally known persons, not Tarika Ramadana, Arabia, Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in the modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are uncertain to the French or European Islamic idea.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen has interviewed are attached to the domain that it is the contrary to Selafi's, the purists of Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia, -- this group is small, but the European Muslims are affected.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are coherent.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
The question is how far the French politicians (and intellectual elite, which thus replaces the public) are given to the pluralism thoughts.
It is that Muslims have probably less experience than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to do historical compromises with the secondary Republic.
More than the pragmatism development tried to "reduce the values of the values".
After reading this book, someone can have the boxes to say, "Yes, but not now."
The most unfortunate views of the world
Arctida changes more dramaticly than the end of the lives of the planet.
The olive is the alarming ice, which affects animals and their survivals as nowhere else.
The interests of the fishing, pneumatic and fishing companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their waking.
The book Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, contains the natural history of the North icon, the polar medvey.
It is well known with complex history and the procedures of the village described the tradition of polar investigators who tried to strengthen the white middle.
The meeting of Nelson ad-hood with a courageous fourteen-year-old wheel, who was fighting only with the muscle's cold is mytus, but all the rest is true.
Youths who bore for their body just killed mothers were arrested and sent to zoo and circles.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar meds were once in a cycle station.
Even today, there is a typical area million times less than it is that it is available to grow together in the divorce. The climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.
After clicking here, you'll find more!
Mr. Ellis chir’s part of the final writers and stories, and often turns back to the threat that the soldiers threaten the survival of species.
Although the fish is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the murder continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter and Indians are captured on the floor, and all are armed by the executive attacking hands that shoot their benefit.
Ironic is that it is playing in the water north of these two people's jail and the ice will finally be the greatest.
In his new book "Po ice" Alun Anderson, former editor New Scientist, offers an uncomfortable and uncomfortable responsibility for Arctic and an aeroplane view of how it can change its future.
Not on all the owners of the answer.
No ororologists and oceanographics have adequate response to changes.
It's for the missing test.
At the end of 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century, Fridtjof Nansen’s research roads indicated how the ice is moved.
The poor for the cold wars, then, maped the crossing areas when they flooded.
Satellite survey and spread zones in ice floors are a useful complement, but many are still running thanks to unrestricted individuals in the winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking forward to the outstanding world of the sleeping system inside the arctic ice created by the smoking of the sweet water, which is disturbing in the wound.
But from the above of the medvey to microscopic miracles, it is all determined to the lock when the ice is moved, which sometimes plays between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, that can be we.
6000 Maritime Sea Fields Placed on the bursts in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled by seven hours a bus to put a simple man on the funeral of a soldier who never met.

It was one of more than 6000 volunteers who were conceived this Sabbath to put the farmers on the sepulchal veterinarians in a number of divisions at the summer act in Arlington.

American Government supplier captured by Cuban Government officials
The Cubaan Government arrested the American Government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as the Ministerial officers introduced on Sunday.
A supplier who has not yet been identified worked for the development Alternatives Inc. with the seat in Bethesda.
The Community works on projects for the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers, together with the American interest section in Hawaii, looked for access to the arrested one who was arrested 5.
Certain accusation was not published, since, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for anything that is "in danger".
All such anti-revolutional activities, including mild protests and critical states, will lead to the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-control graphics and words are considered serious crimes.
There is a young bloging community in Cuba, conducted by the annual commentator Yoani Sánchez, which often writes about how she and her wife are investigated and threatened by government agents.
Mrs. Sanchez requested repeatedly authorization to leave the country to overcome prices, but the authorisation was rejected.
The maintenance of the American supplier may be a result of the growing stress between the communist Castrov brother, managing in Cuba, and Obama's administrative, which was considered as "reserving tactics" in improving the relationships with the island.
As the first report of the New York Times prison on Friday night.
The new American policy highlighted that if the Kuban government undertakes specific steps, such as the release of political rules and creates a more Opposition Space, the United States are a business recycling steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed on Cuba, although these are new and searched codes in the country where the average national employee's staff works 15 dollars per month.
The Cubaan Government has given the normal citizens the right to buy mobile phones right in this year; these are used by a time after sending text messages, because a 15-minute phone talk would stand more than one day moon.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely concerned.
It is available in dear hotels and for their visits and on some government adjudications, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to be approved must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is banned.
The detention of the American in Cuba is frequency.
Most of the United States citizens in Cuba are outside the networks for trees, such as drug feeding, introduced Gloria Berben, the printing officer of the American interest Section in Hawaii.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the procedure.
Prises and detentions were adequate.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open company - let's give that free mobile phones - are on Cuba criminal acts, Miguel Vivanco, manager of the United States Programme for Human Rights, which recently published a recent report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, this Cuba", as an injury on the installation of Raula Castra as a leader of the country and a refund for the elderly brother Fidela.
Vivanco noted that accusations are often arrested, condemned and prisoned in one day.
He concluded that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often causes negative reactions in the United States, just when these two countries are focused on a larger dialogue.
The Pakistanian work of the State administration is aware of the disturbance of the sending of men to Afghanistan.
The Pakistanian offices found a given leader of spiking on the sending of five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill the members of the United States units there, and they found that they hope that this case could help to discover the broad network of terrorists who follow the Internet and seek radicalized young men.
Researchers noticed that they were watching after a severe universal personality known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after the first occurred when one of these men published a comment, which approved terrorist attacks has a YouTube video page.
Saifillah took the leading of these men as they came to Pakistan, trying to help them get to Pakistan remotely in the past of the homes of Pakistan, which is in the house of Al-Kaida and its camps for the development of terrorists.
But the Pakistanian rapporteur officer, who reported the case, indicated that Saifullah was unable to test the leaders of Al-Kaidy and that men were not part of the trial of infiltration into the terrorist network.
Following that, after a few days to the east quarter of Sarghoda, far from the horrible mountains northwest, which became an attack of terrorists.
They were considered to be an outer unit.
That was why they were exhausted, the officer who spoke of the conservation of anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The officer noted that men were not scared and still tried to get an agreement to get access to the camps of Al-Kaida when they were arrested by the execution of Pakistan's rights.
The case of this fiveth - which remained in Pakistan and was heard by the FBI - highlights the critical role of constructors in identifying potential terrorists, and maybe, what is much more important, to determine who is reliable.
Since the attacks on 11 September 2001, the US Science Service has added the highest priority to the attempts to place humans in al-Kajda.
Organizational agents work as guardians who are not sufficiently serious in their commitment to the Holy War and those who could be teachers.
The American falsic records were detailed at al-Kaidy special examination, the analysis was introduced.
However, they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because their potential access to American objectives and their propagation value was given.
But Evan Kohlmann, an elder analytic at NEFA's opinion with the seat in the United States, concluded that terrorist groups have also become more careful in the past years, which will enable them to access, because the American reporting agencies have gained experts in their construction methods.
We are trying to go into these groups, there is no better way to act in accordance with their collection model, which has already been so followed?
This model is one of those who are much more based on the web.
Decades of thousands protested in Kodani, requested climate "actions"
Decades of protestants went on the streets this Sabbath and requested more action on climate than the executives in the city Congress Centre of Bella.
Protestants reported a number of statistics of this event, but the police believed that it was about 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and worm of masked activists put a few small posts near the group of government buildings in the centre of the city.
On the day when a detailed income was reached in the discussions on the climate that the United Nations sponsored, thousands of activists passed through the city and led transparently with the epical titles "This is not the planet B" (e.g. secondary) and one in Spanish, who said "The earth says 'soft'."
The Protest was able to celebrate some of the Danish models and photographs of Helena Christian, which indicated that she was going to her mother's parents in Peru and gave me information about the unfortunate state of the country on which the climate changes are affected.
This is partly the reason why we have decided to join this big coming -- to pass through the world and call on the leadership of the world to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not easy, but it's necessary to do it, but it can't be avoided.
The police forbid the protestants to approach the center of Bella and noticed that she had 19 persons, firstly because they had or had a mask or a capsule.
These activities are prohibited in accordance with the Danish rights during the demonstration.
According to one of the unemployed wheels that are not to be identified, because it is involved in climate rounds, activist maskation as sports and in black clothes have placed a number of pressures near the Code's main channel that is located near some ministers.
They were agitated at the buildings, introduced, started with lights, but then followed "a few big explosions."
Inside the Congress Centre, people were sharing around television images to watch the travel during the afternoon.
But the protest was probably not in the home of key officers, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When he was asked whether the demonstration should have been influenced on international negotiations, he answered the English "Atually, that is something that I was not aware of" (in fact, it's something I don't know).
Then he continued in chinese and said, "Why it's nice, I can't hear what's going out."
He watched whether the trail was painful or helpful depending on the views of everyone.
It is to see the focus of the broad public and different sectors and the subject of climate changes, he said.
In other words, "I can also say that it's the destruction of the commitment or the freedom of the residents.
The test data discovered continuously sustaining racial differences
The Federal Certificate of the last week of the knowledge of mathematical knowledge was a welcome element of the good news about the public school of Columbia.
Although the surrounding is far to be highly executive systems of the country, the testimony has shown more progress in the fourth and eightth classs in the last two years than in the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains behind the last numbers of the National Ateist Centre for Progress in the School is a sustainable difference between African and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average outcome of the white wheels of the fourth cycle of Columbia in the last two years increased from 267 to 270 points (of possible 500), but in their African species there were only three points, from 209 to 212.
The Chapter in the achieved knowledge increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
The progress in Africans in the eighth class remains basically equipped, with the decline of statistically unsignificant one of 245 to 245.
The average result in white bullets was not included in test test results because the size of the pattern was not sufficiently large.
The image at the horizon of six years is not just encouraged.
The division between white and black wheels of the fourth class in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the circuit, was 60 points of the stage (262 to 202).
Although the result of children from both groups had improved during this period, the division of races approached 58.
Some experts of education in the surrounding area in the last week have concluded that the results, celebrated by Michelle A. Rhee's secrets and the older Adrian M. Fentym (D), were more stimulated in white students in the area where high results had already been.
This would say that we have increased the summary of the support of those at the highest end of the stage, which is problematic and concerned, Jeffίith, Executive Director D.C. Voice, said of an unprocessable group that covers the equality of training in the circuit.
I'm not going up and down for two or three points, said a member of the Committee of D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth class of the basic school in Eatone.
Often criticizeing Mrs. Rhee's administration, Mrs Brown stated that the report on test outcomes means the Mediterranean School in the town is in a deteriorated state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you want to see the clothes and I respect it.
But it is awesome that we did not almost have any time and energy that was needed to make our medium-school.
Mrs. Rhee said that the efforts of the circuit are to continue searching for better ways that are focused on the needs of students with low results.
This fall, for example, are some school factors in the use of new bases reading, Wilson's reading system, related to students of higher schools and medium-school students, who did not acquire the foundations of reading before in their horn career, significantly based on their type of wedding.
Each daily mate and the base of mathematical education in the sixth class, highlighting games and experience of real life, which have been reached in the circuit of the former director Clifford Janeyi, is my -- to add to the top of the NAEP progress, which has been reported last week.
And I just think they had to continue working and do the best principles for those students who remain under class level, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others have stated that NAEP's outcomes explained the question whether Mrs. Rhee could continue to increase the total performance of the system and continue to provide further money and employment for schools with low performance, which is necessary to reduce differences.
It's a certain profitable dilemma, Mrs. Michel Rheeov, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the California University in Berkeley, where he studies tests in towns.
The conventional process of restructuring is to enhance school reforms and administrative reforms located in the worst parts of Columbia.
Thus, it can lead to political doses that are contrary to the important agenda.
But the outcome belongs to the rest of the city managers who are trying to maintain the middle range between white and black.
We have to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to use our school family so that all families, unless they live, can help them to make their children a good public education.
Mr. Janey, now the school manager in Newark, introduced in the interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between achieved results is the prolongation of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the circuit to achieve the rights of school.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, Mr. Janey said, who closed with his association of lonely factors for a school year in 185 days, which constitutes a "mark" for the search for a greater increase in the next year.
Make higher education part of the better future
The outcome bus was brought to Gettysburg's rail with a voiced breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came up and was on white columns, cigarettes and smaragd green treasures.
Gracielini's parents tried to graduate a high school in El Salvador.
Even now Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never walked on the road.
Now she and other eight-thirds in the group examined Gettysburg, where the school worked 38690 dollars per year, their position was more than the fear of visiting potential students.
That's it! she called Graciel who would have studied the medical when he offered them to enter the building.
You guys, you know, the rules were in mind when they made them a low proportion of professors to students.
Pennsylvania's rail was one of the seven who visited their classday interest and now they were completely discovering the future message: The question is not whether you would enter the trip.
The question is from where.
In general, this is a weak problem with the high number of children of Spanish immigrants in the United States, who are thrown out of high schools or who are disfellowshipped as unflying, but the statistics of those who will receive further education and so go into the middle class.
The fifth of this "double generation" Spanish jackets from the rail - carefully achieved results is that many of their immigrant parents, the majority of Mexico and the people of Central America, came to the United States without finishing a high school.
Their history of success is important, the researchers are aware of it because it stresses their point of road for the generation that played a environmental role in the field of work forces of the country.
Those who have reached high school education say that they had a natural decline to school, and the natural devotion and effort.
Many parents also had high goals to their children and looked for ways to replace the uncertainty of the American School.
However, school programmes also play an extraordinary role in Graciele and millions of children who would likely resolve a lot - especially if these efforts were overtime.
Let's see that children's beauty from groups with low advantages whose parents have no experience and ability to help them in the system, no simple principle at each individual point, says Patricia Gándar, researcher at the California University in Davis, where she studied students from Latin America.
We have to think about it, and we have given these kids a wonderful network in the pre-school, all ways to read high school.
The Federal Programme, which financed Graciely's commitment, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (appeal) provides more than 300 million dollars annually for local school systems for launching additional preparatory programs that start for students from small income groups and continue until these students end high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, from which more than 1% of them have entered into a series, according to the data of the American School Ministry.
The Iraq Ministry of Agricultural Promotion has reached agreements with 10 farming companies
Without prejudice to the concerns of violence and political stability, the Iraq government has been able to accept significant agricultural companies to restructure their inevitable infrastructure during the two periods of Sabbath.
Ten agreements have concluded the Iraq Ministry of the Promotional Promotion with foreign farming companies, which indicates that Chinese, Russian and European agriculture companies are prepared to play a significant role in the renewal of Iraq's village, protected for decades of wars and sanctions.
America's companys have passed with the shipmates right to two of the 10 broken fields.
Seven American companies payed for the second one, which began on Friday.
Only one offered a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on the field that was taken in June.
The cave of the American railway gigantes in the open Iraqic race industry surprised the analysis.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of the American companies you have here first on Asiat and Europe, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online reports.
It's going to be before anything else in Iraq is going to sell.
The security concerns, highlighted by the coordinated bomb attacks in attacks and political instability, like the download of American armies, probably reflect the American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which is demonstratively the third of the largest surovin reserves, are called analytics.
In some cases, the American companies were in a disagreement, especially the Chinese and the remaining governments controlled energy company have significantly lower operational costs and are higher to risk because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and O日al Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded the agreements with the Ministry.
The former American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhi·ps, who kept close contacts with the Iraq Ministry of Agriculture and offered technical assistance in the past years, have gone with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were two of the contracts assigned to the end of this week.
State Chinese National Petroleum Corp. shared in offers on more contracts than all the remaining companies and went with large parties in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to make it a major economic, as well as a strong force, said the speaker of the Ministry of the Great Industrie of Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and have their commitments against Iraq.
Communities which were preliminaryly chosen for the proposal, which were then compared to the Ministry's price of barrier and ministeriality, are willing to pay for the increase in the outcome over the current level in each field.
The al-Kaidy spy planner was obviously killed in Pakistan.
In the impact of the American rackets at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, a spy planner of Al-Kaidy operation was obviously killed, as reported on Friday of the American Anti-Terrorist Department.
As confirmed, it could be a second death attack on one of the highest terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when a few cancers arrived on their cars near the city of Miran Sáh in North Vaziristan, according to American resources and Pakistanian officers in Putia.
The local offices deceived that the rackets were removed from the airport without the type of type operating with the feeding of illegal domestic tribes.
These were listed on a white car that moved to the Afghanistan border when he was locked, the officer introduced along with the Pakistanian citizen expert agent who phoned from Miran Shah.
The officer noted that local weapons were attached to the point and enjoyed what was left from "total devastated bodies".
The local authorities were not able to verify the identity of the victim, but two American officers of the Anti-Terrorist Division cited an unspecified witness that indicated that Somali was after death.
Somali was described as a highly established military planner for Al-Kaidy Operations, who managed terrorist groups other than Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the refunding worldwide, said a higher officer who was not to be called, which indicated the sensitive attitude of American airports in Pakistan' territory.
It was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the highest leadership of Al-Kaidy and, based on them, he planned potential terrorist attacks.
Another American officer said that Somalia Âe had been in the al-Kajdy hierarchie and was well connected to the final extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a generally known person for some Americans, but that he did not have any way to call our associates before us and ours, he said another officer.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be a second highly established leader of Al-Kaida or Taliban who should be killed since September when the same attack was killed by the Nammudin Jalolov, the leader of the military group in the feast of domestic tribes and three other poperative leaders.
The time of the attacks started by the airports without piloting has been decreased since the year from the average six operations per month per month, according to the records of the Long War, the websites, managed by the non-scale group.
Decreasing may have a deficiency in the improved tactic of terrorist groups that have effected steps to restrict their vulnerability by providing a misfriendly killing persons who had been understood that they were informators.
The Supreme Delegate of the United Nations in Kabul departed.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, introduced on Thursday that he would like to leave from his own in March and complete the so furious period that was murdered by a large corruption by the president's election in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide's leaving is because Obam's administration decided to send another 30000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations delegate noted that he supported growth, but he stressed that the United States' time period of reduction of the status that begins in 18 months should be a challenge for the government of the remaining NATO States to reduce their force.
We need to build Afghanistan security forces and send the right signal to Afghanistan that he trusted in the international community, introduced Eide in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment is accepted.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and the remaining military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees helping in the political change of Afghanistan.
The growth on the side of armed forces must be copied to civils, said.
Eide said he did not change, but he just fulfilled the promise that he gave his family in March 2008 that he held only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now stated that he would need time to find a refund.
As I said, it's the highest time to look at the follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the department of my preacher and my arrival.
According to the U.S. Ban officials, the search for a refund began.
The officers have noticed that it is decided between Staffan di Mistrua, who has a Swedish-Italian pound and had previously conducted the United Nations mission in Bagdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, France, which had previously conducted the United Nations peace operation.
The Eide position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused of the president of Hamid Karzaïm in September, who wined in the land presidential elections from masking the presence of massive election machines.
Eide overcome this statement, but he noticed that the accusation of Galgraith -- which was released -- "determinedly harmed the mission because there was a high degree of skepsis regarding international principles" at the choice.
Eide concluded that he attended a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens to coordinate the efforts to lead the United States force in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations leadership to enable his representatives to gain more jobs from the United States and the remaining western countries that would pay them for the Afghanistan mission, so, as he says, he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money is correctly allowed.
Eide expressed a denunciation on the restriction of his efforts in Afghanistan and noted that the U.S. Sweet Regulation on the name of the subgroup was able to use its ability.
The United Nations rules are that I had the opportunity to get from May only one person, he said.
That's a disaster, and I can't continue.
Gates: Iraq is a member of other sanctions
The Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said that the world powers will soon cause Iran "a further significant sanction" for the failure of engagement in discussions on his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to the group of approximately 300 American soldiers in North Iraq during the weekly road in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, bagatelize the views of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the question of the soldier to the probably development.
One thing that depends on me is whether I have learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is an invisible invisible in the war.
The administration of Obam is decided at the package of sanctions that could include the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect the normal Iraqs.
He said that "the battle of winning and defense" would require "to accept the Iranian government to feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer extraordinaryly" sanctions.
According to the Friday statement issued by the speaker of the White House Robert Gibbs, the administration involved the European leader in warning that Iran would bring serious challenges if he did not carry out his nuclear programme in full conformity with the United Nations nuclear security committee and its supervisory authority, the International Agency for Atomic Energy.
Iran does not want to develop his professional knowledge only for peaceful people.
In the discussions in Geneva, 1 October, he noted that he wanted to return to the discussions on the limitation of his nuclear programme and agreed that he would provide a significant part of its resource of uran exchange for the necessary fuel for the reacter to conduct medical research.
It was regulated for such agreement as for the way of determining confidence between both parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since that time, Iran seems to decline from the provisional agreements - partially, it refers to the expert because Iraq's leadership is divided in view of whether to engage in the United States.
It is sincerely said, if Iraq's firmness towards the international community in the case of some of the rates with whom he agreed at the beginning of October, I think that it has brought a international community, including Russia and China, together on the road that is not about the termology of additional sanctions against Iraq, said Gates.
President Obama set on the 31st final term for Iran to answer us before he returned to search for other elections, which now called Hillary Rodham Clinton "degrading sanctions".
In the decree issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations judged on Thursday what was called "independent and uninvited" before some members of the Security Committee on Iranian Nuclear Activities and said that he wanted to continue in conversations with the United States and five other worldwide powers "for the achievement of an advanced solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraq Ministry President Nouri al-Maliki before he fled to the Kurdishtan, rich on the roof to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and the Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
It endures high stress between Kurda and the Iraq Arabic, especially because of border, own rights and the distribution of revenues.
Gtes invited both parties to reduce the potential for conflicts to prevent the maintenance of the United States plans to restrict the number of US soldiers from 115000 to 50000 to the end of August.
Gates also tried to disturb Kurdish concerns from sustaining depression. The U.S. official places cited Gatese when he shared Massud Barzaani, President of the Kurdish regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the United Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In ancient China, the change of the course
Wang Weijia and her wife have grown around propagandistic plates on which they read that "The Mother of the Earth is too excited to enjoy more children" and "A child also means one burst more."
Then they learned that when the official governments in Shanghai, alarmed by low generations and older populations in their town, immediately changed the course in this year and began to encourage young couples, their reactions were immediately and decided: Never.
We always had all our time and energy just to one child.
We haven't left anything for the other, says Wang, 31 years, a human resource manager who has a 8-month son.
For more than 30 years, China's sustainable policy to have only one child was introduced and thus created two generations only of notoric bottled and wild kids, affectedly overwhelmed "Small Caesars", which threatened population crisis.
The average generation has decreased 1,8 children to a couple in comparison with six before the political entry into force, according to the United Nations data.
The division of the population where the population is 60 years old and higher is expected to grow from 16,7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the total average of 20 per cent.
Inequality is more rich cities with high school education, for example in Shanghai.
Loni people in 60 years old and higher have created almost 22 percent of the inhabitants registered in Shanghai, while the birth was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, manager of the Shanghai City Commission for the population and family planning, said that many couples have to have children to "help to reduce the proportion of older population and to reduce the status of work forces in the future".
He says that it's about "being old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries, such as Japan or Sweden."
Advanced calamity
As introduced in the country establishment in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably the most contrary mandate of the communist party government today.
The two who violated the political caused an immortal trial -- to the threeth of their annual payment in some -- and discrimination in the work.
China's official places promoted a policy that helped the country to protect the critical disorder of natural resources, while human rights holders were deceived in promoting policy.
In the foreign area, some of the officers suggested pregnant women in the second child to travel with the losses.
Moreover, many two have had to have sexy choice losses, leading to an unnaturally high condition of men against women.
In the past years, the population officers have been gradually smaller in their assignment to the policy of one child.
In 2004, the extent of exception - including cities, members of national minorities and cases when men and women were single -- and in 2007 they measured their passwords, which were a solid line.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor of the Population Research Institute of Peking University, said that central government officers already discussed rather radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children, if one of the partners was the only one.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city, which laid down an aggression campaign for more births.
At the end of the night, the platelets, the parents asked to have only one child, replaced by copies of the regulation, detailedly described how to have a second child and how to ask for authorisation.
The town administration sent officers for the planning of the family and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and judge the airports under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, the family planning officers introduced.
Reply-to-speaking
Although the officers in a foreign town in the area of Shanghai mentioned an increase in interest in two who wanted to have a second child after the campaign started, the cities were not changed.
The town circuit of Huinan with the population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Fornication officials in Shanghai have noticed that, despite the campaign, the population of born in the city in 2010 remained expected only about 165000 - quite higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, the Family Planning Committee in the Shanghai Fourth of Caolu, stated that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to give it the best to the first child, he introduced it.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that she had two children and was legally allowed to them.
But as many Chinese who have only a short-sufficient health and life-security, given by government.
Without a comprehensive network, the choice could be unresponsible.
People in the west view the policy of a child wrongly as a controversial legal question, says Yang, a building engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in relation to the first child.
Yeah, we were able to have more than one child.
But the problem is just political.
It's about money.
Other couples use psychological damage of weight.
Wang, human resource manager, says they're just a child, because she was the only one, "We were the center of our family and all cared about us.
We weren't used to provide care and we wouldn't want to take care of others.
Chen Seiian, 42 years old, a government translation company, has made it much more uncovered.
For two carriers from the middle class that reduced birth, he said to be successful means to be selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 years old are viewed by parents as the first days of Chinese experience with capitalism and do not want this way of life for themselves, says.
It's just one kid who makes great demands for parents' time, he says.
Mother must offer at least two years of his community life.
Then there are still serious issues of prospect -- "You have to stop your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have reasons ready at the time when the child is nine months for good pre-school education.
Most of his friends want to please one child, says Che, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher food standards, he says.
We don't want to offer too many victims.
The United Nations group has made a plan for reduction.
The United Nations sponsored climate -- characterised remotely unleavened positions and mutual consideration -- again on Friday, it focused on the release of a document which is a ambitionary reduction of the quantity of glass gas during the next 40 years with industrialised nations, an incompatible volume of competition in the nearest term.
The text that can provide the outcome for the final political agreement on the regulation of glass gases is highlighting the remaining obstacles as it lights the road forward.
But there was a significant progress in negotiations that passed in a wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who would come to Codena next week.
The work created by the United Nations ad hoc group, this text indicates unfortunately how much money the poor countries should provide for the poor to cope with global short-term and time-up.
And provides the whole election palette for key issues, including how to develop and control the future economics so that they can limit their carbon output and what should be the upper level of global temperature growth, which political factors will still be able to tolerate.
This provides a major dose of flex, says John Coequyt, the top representative of the Washington Club of Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six page document, constructed from 180 pages of the text from the negotiation to what the spike officer described as a "great image".
It sets the distortions for my agreement, in which industrial nations could limit their levels together to 25 to 45 per cent in comparison with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their levels to 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Commonly, the country would decrease up to 2050 between 50 and 95 per cent.
The European Union negotiated on Friday the promising that it would provide $3,6 billion for the next three years to help poorer countries accept the adjustment to climate changes -- from the possibility of recovery and sugar to the destruction.
However, on Friday, the same type of verbal fire tools that were overcome during discussions last week.
The United States Special Sender for climate issues, Todd Star, refused the word, which requires obligatory restrictions for spring gases for industrial countries in comparison with the voluntaryness of main economic developments, unless they were financed by the developed world.
The position signaled that Obam's administrative administration had a stronger line towards China to be Bush's administrative officer just ago two years ago.
The United States will not access without transfering the main development countries and implementing actions, said Star, who also assured that the text was not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be checked by external observators.
Stern acted with this comment for a hour after the Chinese design of the minister of He Yafei communicated to the American main negotiator about climate issues that either the lack of "social understanding" or "immortal independence" led before the week to notify that the United States would not help China financially so that they could be able to cope with global repairs.
With the future of the economic roads of the main world powers in the landscape, the tachynics and the inner developing world and between the industrial world and the economic development.
The current battle is to maintain individual economy more than to maintain the planet, between China and the United States in respect of the fulfilment of their relevant commitments, while poor people warn that two decades of the most influenced countries of the world ignore the depth imperation for the implementation of more actions.
Ricardo Ulate, the delegate of Kosovo, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting the costs of the limitation of rail gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in seeking a way of preventing large issuers responsiblely.
This is a game about the development of a new economic hegemonie, Ulate said, which also serves as regional advisers in regional climate changes in Mexico and Central America for International Nature Protection.
Some of the countries who are the most vulnerable impact of climate changes indicated that they would like to continue in the processing of legally binding agreements in Codean, but most of the major authorities, said that the best outcome of discussions would be a political agreement.
Small Islands Aliance, which has 43 members, created 24 pages and the agreement last fifth.
Arturge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiation in the European Commission's benefits, said that the promotion of small island nations has "appointed a political focus on the whole political process" partly because they are now united and require action from growing economy, such as China and India.
The appeal was called for a new importance when delegates insisted that they should resolve the number of issues of serious issues before the heads of the Government are agreed.
High position officials, such as the Indian Ministry of Life Protection of Jairam Rameš and the Chinese Ministry, came out of the airport and passed by the halls of the Centre Bella to the closed door of meetings and new assemblies so that they could handle the sentences that will be made next week.
The total number of confusions - when 13,000 people were spent every day from and to the congress center, the chitars of angry activists insisted on ironising inquiry on the countries they thought they were sent, and they were affected to transfer from hands to paper more than the electronic mail -- controlled call.
Intensity is only a surprise: in Codan there were almost all key ministers and early in the middle of 60 heads of the States.
We have reached high category, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Minister for Global Policy at the International Nature Protection.
They're getting hard weights.
British first influenza with 140 miles per hour predefinited this Monday feelings
at 5:13 on Monday, the stars spread the darkness to the sign of the dragging of the wolf, which means the revolution of transport in British.
The high-quality personal impact in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kentu to London St Pancras and overcome the distance of 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and put the first high-quality personal reaction outside lLndyn.
He hopes that the new service, where appropriate, connects British with the international networks of the sive, complex wheels and connects great aglomeration of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Reserved waters should be reduced by the transport time in personal transport and on trading roads and travel from aircraft and cars to railway and could reduce carbon and eliminate streets.
Theoretics have been allowed by three main political parties to gain this vision.
But decades of billions of liberal freedoms necessary to build a new national railway network, an inevitable fight against projects and anxieties about the destruction of life-life now have accelerated the building of British high-quality traces.
High Speed Two (HS2), company created in January to provide a implementing study to the government, transmitted its message to Lord Adonis 30, as Times said.
She gave him a detailed map through the next planned stage of high-quality network.
The new traveling of London with the West Midland has been proposed to five meters in towns and quarters where to touch life center could be difficult.
In the open country, the final road was planned to 25 m.
HS2 also suggests to specify three options for a high-quality network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer the jacket.
The preferred choice is the confikation of the letter of Y, when one high quality trace should be brought to West Midland.
Trace should be shared nearby Birmingham with one hold from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One trail should be brought to Scotland.
"It seems to have happened to the most effective choice," said the railman.
As soon as it's done, the driving time between London and Edinburgh will be shortened for two hours and 40 minutes.
The stage opened before 2025 could allow the traveler to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes in comparison with more than one hour in the presence.
The impact should be enabled to carry out 2250 miles per hour, which would result from the British network in Europe.
The start trace is already used to carry the weapons within 400 m , which would be able to transport 1100 persons.
Up to 18 communications could operate every hour on London - Birmingham trail.
It means that the London terminal could be able to serve in case of needs to be 20000 travelers in a hour.
As regards the restriction of the aircraft, the existing station would be extended so that it would take a high quality network.
Actors of railways claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offers such a potential.
Lord Adonis shall notify whether or not to implement this scheme, but the comprehensive public consequences and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be taken before general options.
Although he's putting a car into a move, the network should be built by parts.
The wheels should first be introduced to the operation not to high-economic traits, but already existing traits north of Birmingham and keep the wind-times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is designed as a decision-making point to ensure transition from flights to flights, the orientation point for the revolution on the railway.
The tax payers took the hypoteque at 75000 litres on the Tory orangeria
Alan Duncan, holders of the front seat la Tory's in the missionary, have secured the tax payers thousands of liberal costs last year for the oranshee that he built in his house in the electoral area.
the speaker of the officer, who was degraded by David Cameron because he tried to live "from the provisions", he increased his hypoteque to 75,000 litres to build a dubble extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to make special interests, in total hundreds of frees per month for tax payers.
The Common Authorities have approved the claims at the time, and they have not been heard by Sir Thomasen Leg, who carried out the control of the Member issues. Last night Mr. Duncan expressed his requests "is possible to be cleaner or easier."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of the Parliament, has two double houses at all in its electoral area Rutland and Melton.
The houses have a value of about a million libers.
There is a kitchen, a residence room and a food, but the financial office agreed that Mr. Duncan's more space.
Last year, he added to the house of the winter garden, which is in the plans called "foreigner".
Neighbors describe it as a "screen for fun and welcome".
Mr Duncan has not been requested to provide an explanation to the increased payment during the last control of the General Standard Committee and the privileges in the latest equation of the hypoteque.
The committee reported to him last month that he violated the rules after reviewing his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupilary security on the hypoteque at 271406 litres from his ownership in London to the house in his electoral area, which he bought in 1991, before he became a member of the missionary complaint.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan had approximately $1400 per month in the interest of the hypoteque until March of the latest year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1800 litres per month.
The interest of RBS's hypothetic payment of Mr Duiscean could not be changed at this time, which indicates that all of this was intended for the finance of the payment of 75000 litres.
The standard RBS variable payment of the hypoteque was reduced in 2007 from 7,94 per cent in March 2007, where it remained.
The latest document of the General Agency shows that Mr Duncan continued in charge of 1250 litres per month in May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as a stain leader of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed her and said that the lawyers must survive "in the land" after the scandal of expenditure.
"In principle, it's being organized, you've got to live in the land and it's coming with you as with s**t."
He said, "I lost my money for my garden and my debt and a little break for what was necessary.
And I could cause all the fucking part, but I'm not going to do it."
A lawyer, a millioner of former careers as a trademan, was first invited to explain his publication in May when it was shown that he was throwing thousands of frees for his garden, even before the approval of the financial authority, that it could be considered to be excessive.
One of the activists buried the jaw in the face of a sign of Mr. Dueuan's trauma to protest after it was discovered that he was spent $4000 for three years.
When he was questioned last night to increase the hypoteque, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the increase of the ability, which was approved as the financial authority, as follows the Lee."
Added: "This is not a question of hiding and calling or violating rules or something else.
It's absolutely equal to the line down, according to rules, rights, and it's all.
It wouldn't be a lot of other ways cleaner or easier."

Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsing place, and we tried to try and present it by the road."

Latest payment: divergence monitors, planned measures
The Committees of Foreign Supervisors reported on Friday "general mobilization" because they requested to pay premiums and overtimes of their refunds to ice.
The prison FO (2. The Supervisor Committees) requested employees who would be able to have a service to participate in demonstrations ended in front of the preliminary equipment, and to "lock them" and thus warn them on "their border cross".

I know about the effort that the Sergeant works in order to ensure the functioning and modernization of our system, writes ministerially in his communication.
I have ordered the Administrative Directory to take immediate measures to add to the Ministry of Alliot-Mariova a bad evaluation of the number of cross-terms in the future.

However, in any case of financial guards because little, the general secretary Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Ambassadors say he gives "better gifts" on the winter than those who get

I'm sure how I saw my father, who came to look at us on the morning and how he gave me that basketball sword, the president told me.
Then I realized that the sword actually gave me him.
The lady took her back to a house for girls.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, so I just set all the inhabitants in the wall instead of put it around the blood, but I loved the small house for the girls, Michelle Obam.

66th years old rocker was reoperated on the night from the center to Thursday in the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found the "smitting out of the operation" of the rocks that he had made in Paris on November 26, reported his printing division in Paris, with the fact that these lesses were required of "right operation".
However, the printing section of the song tried to quiet the public and noticed that it was "under control" and notified that the new Medical Communication would be issued at least 48 hours later.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the songs of the last tour, Johnny Hallyday was introduced into a artistic dream to prevent "sons and complications".
In 48 hours when the patient opens the eyes, we'll have a little more certainty, he adds RTL.
The printing section did not confirm this information on the AFP question.
The RTL also states that according to "certain resources" no drain was located after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on the International Clinic Parc Monceau for a cross-border platform.
Operation planned a few days ago has been carried out by Stephan Delajoux, the neurochirurgy, a doctor well known in artificial crossings.
But the doctor wasn't available on Thursday to report RTL information.
After this operation, Johnny Hallyday's song was hospitalized in the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles for the infection that came after the battle.
The song Eʹ Mitchell, the nearby friend Johnny Hallydaye said on Thursday in the RTL that his friend is just walking "what's wrong", but added that he's about the rock's "don't worry," because he's a big "boyman."
He called me just before he was going to Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing a stupid thing because he was spending 12 hours in the aircraft after such a operation, there's no pleasure, said E. Mitchell.
In the middle of the evening, the song manufacturer Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that infection was "stoped".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laetsia, a song woman, and that he didn't notice any special concerns.
The health problems can only sing from July when he was hospitalized for nine days after his jacket.
Two months later, to surprise everyone, was discovered that Johnny Hallyday was operated on the "small tissue tree" and then on the weak infection.
At the end of September, the song returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his divorce.
But since that time, each of his health problems has been very investigated and commented.
In the middle of November, he had to denote his team again the new hospitalization message.
Euro-2009/Small Basin: Premier Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Francouz Frédérick Bousquet, a three-based medalyst for the world's mastership in 2009 in the large basen, received a quarter title for Europe's Mistership 2009 in a small basen in Istanbul in a discipline, particularly 50m free way.
The day of mystery, on which combinations were allowed, only three world records were fallen, although they were expected much more.
One of them conveyed the Hungarian box Evelyn Verras's to 200 meters of position and two remaining men's staff Russian to 4x50 meters of position.
A big trouble for Bousquet, who made a deal for a world record of 50 m in a free way, whose holder is already in the large basen (20.94).
In one of the two king's disciplines of flight, 50m free way, he wined 28 years of France at the end of 20,53 seconds in the final, where ten ships were primarily restarted instead of the eight running.
Bousquet struck Chorvata Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia Sergeye Fesikova (20.84), but he could not convince the world record (20.30), as he suggested.
We could dream about something better, but I said if there's a world record in my way, I'll try.
Like Bousquet, almost all the vessels had combinations made from polyuretan, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
Combinations have helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first host in 1999 for the same competition.
The use of the combination this time did not help the Germans Paul BiPropertymann, a double world master in a large basin in Rome, who had a world record on the hands.
The young boat could not convince the record that holds 400 meters free way (3:32.77), but he wins with another most rough time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian leader Nikito Lobintseve (3:35.75) and Danem Madsem Glasner (3:36.82)
I didn't get everything into that bathroom.
I knew that this time I wouldn't overcome the world record, but I was able to guess my title and I completed my task.
Lobintsev will be a serious competition in the future, explained by Bidheidmann.

He hurt two more people, obviously in a case: a thirty-five-year-old man, the second seriously.
As all happened, it's not completely fair because everything was played in dinner hours.
He was armed by two arms that took the cross behind his back, said at the place of the leader of Alliance in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
A number of survivors, including young people, have tried to stop and disarma, according to the testimony of the AFP conceived.

United States: Lawyer of Poland again requests the end of the penalty
The Polish-France Revisor Romana Polanski again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the West of the United States) to stop the penalty against his customer, which is currently located in his Swiss residence for the famine of the Afer, which occurred for thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the Legal Representative of the Pianist film, criticized before three judges of the second second period of the court in California, a serious mill, which occurred during the judgment of the event in 1977.
I'm asking for the stop of screening now and immediately, the lawyer Hummel introduced and added that from the behavior of the judge who then decided in the matter, Laurence Rittenband "he had a throat in the back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died) had to act before the sentence of the judgment with the State Representative, who told him that Roman Polandski would deserve to proceed – which is a serious crime against the law.
The information on this discussion was found in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and requested), from the mouth of a single State representative, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally announced to the end of September that he was lying to the author's document.
If the Court refuses to stop criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will request the execution of a court compliance that will be able to submit evidence of his claim.
The claimer repeated what was already said at the first state, that no serious simplification would be made to ask for the stop of penalty until Roman Polandski was left before the court.
The 76th year-old register came from the United States in 1978, before the court made a judgment in the case of "unlawful sexy" with an unfaithful girl in 13 years of age.
Since that time, he has never come back to the United States territory.
The prosecutor's officer in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polandski " should be there to participate in a courtyard."
We want to tell Romana Polaska not only in this case, but even the other accused that it is possible to flee? asked Mrs Asayam.
It's the opinion that the register "demands for the court of kindness, and, at the same time, he demands his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to take the decision also highlighted that there are other alternatives to the outcome.
Mr Hummel wasn't the one who asked for the arrest of Romana Polanski's penalty.
The representative of the victim, Samanthy Geimer also again asked for the end of the offence.
She recalled that her client's no longer takes the accountable complaint every time the case of Poland, and she added, "No one in this room can say that the process was just."
Thirty-two years, it's enough."

According to the printing statement, a song in Los Angeles was sing night from dàu "unwaned in the art sleep", which is to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor of Cedars-Sineai’s hospital in Los Angeles already listed in the art sleep. The hospitalization came from a deep infection after the operation of a scared inter-traditional platelet successful on November 26, Paris.
With regard to serious damage caused by this principle, a song must have been reoperated in the middle to Thursday .
According to AFP photograph, his wife Laeticia participated on Friday in the French College of Los Angeles, which visits their daughter Jade.
The Presidency of the Orthodox Chirurgie and Traumatology of the hospital la Pitié-Salppetrière, Yves Catone, announced that to songs in Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer forced Dr. Stéphana Delajouxe, neurochirurg, who operated on Clinique International du Park Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They told us that it was a massacre.
Chirurgs from Los Angeles announced that they were baptized, introduced Mr. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of the future court process, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday's left too much to Los Angeles and allowed his Paris chirurgical."
I personally talked to the phone doctor, and the one assured me that this way wasn't a problem, which was very surprised, because I had already suffered a two-fold interval of inter-traditional platelets, added.
A few minutes ago at the RTL station, the song was obviously flying after Paris's operation without a thief, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very known in artificial crossings.
He operated Marii Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before she died in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, on which she worked at that time.
In 2007, he also operated the Charlotte Gainsbourg heat when removed the hematome, a result of the bloody in the brain.
It is, however, a doctor with dark reputation, sometimes deceived in cases of disturbance of medical care, tax injuries and subcutanees.
The medical lawyer Olivier Metzner named him as "a man without a snuckle", which is "regularly" called before the medical camera, which can't even "recommend".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux issued things on Friday by his lawyer David Koubbi.
He noted that the progress had "exactly good progress" and the reoperation investigation was "normal".
Operation was not a hemorragic character, so it was not necessary for the introduction of the tree," added.

It is obvious that the term of renewal of the planned tour on January 8 (In Amiens, p. re.) appears too close, declared Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and calls the New Centre party to continue to use their shortcut.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, reacted on Friday on the trial of the President of the New Centre, Hervey Morin on the accuracy of the former Giscard party, with a short-term use in no media under the threat of criminal disturbance.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its purpose to adjust the UDF shortcut with that François Bayrou would not deserve to bear her inheritance after he gave his left hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose partner is the UMP, had to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of New Centre (CN).
This step has been supported by Mr Hervê de Charetta (ex-UMP now for CN), which is attributing its ownership to the UDF marks, because he left it first in 2004 to register in the National Institute of Industrial Propriétés (l'Institut national de la proprieté industrialelle).
But on Friday evening, the Committee of the UDF Association of Friends, Françoise Bayroua, who are not intended to be exhausted, came out of his silence and gave the formal request of the Minister and the Members to stop using a short time and returned to the property of the protection marks under the threat of a crime.
In recent days, you have increased anxious statement of your political movement + again to take a UDF shortcut, writes the Association in your letter signed 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis from Alliance Centrist.
In addition, you considered appropriate to locate on your propagation materials and on the welcome website of your name+Nouveau center+, with a slogan +UDF today+, are also found by letter signatures.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, the UDF committee explains that the NC movement is soon to remove all changes, namely, UDF from all propagation materials, of course (all) web pages."
It also requests Herv de Charrette "to deliver the property of the protection marks to the legitimate owners".
If you don't do so, we'll return to the court to respect the law and legitimate laws of the members of the UDF, they warn the signatory.
In his letter, it states that UDF "is a full-right political movement in 1978, and they believe that Mr. Morin and his friends "selected " the department in 2007 " to create competitive movement, as others in 2002, to establish the UMP.
The movement of New Centre does not, according to them, have no right to use the UDF shortcut (Union for la democracy Franceise).
In addition, they believe that the last UDF convention voted in 2007 for the connection to the MOD for three years and for the establishment of the committee of the "more and material interests" of the association based on Valérym Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervego de Charette, the Committee continues "when he registered a protected mark", not "a three-year-old member of the UDF", but UMP.
In a scandal and subwater way, he used non-existent registration of acronym to act in order to do so on its own.
This inactivity begins to change into criminal acts, they declare, and then they express themselves to the NC strategy: "We think that, as in politics, it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to get out of anonymity of subwater adoption on which we do not have the right."

I think he's gonna get her.
I'm talking about her, he announced after the hearing of Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kieman.
With regard to the lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Oliviera Metzner, this decision welcomed the Court.
It's a good news (...). Expertise will show that with this old lady, who has manipulated the protection (M. Banier), he has confirmed.
There are two years that the only daughter of Liliany Bettencourt started a criminal proceeding against François-Marie Banier, photographs and artists who are guilty that a long year he used the state of weakness of her mother to gain a billion euros in the form of shocks, contracts on life insurance or images of the masters.
Therefore, Liliane Bettencourt rejected that she would be manipulated by a photograph that he considers a friend.
While the court had to judge the rights of the complaint given to Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the fifth sentence of the lawyers had changed in a family hour of truth.
Avocate Liliany Bettencourt presented three letters that his customer (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her note, and in which she issued her unbelieving to the wife of Françoisy Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Lilian Bettencourt adds: "You could explain my daughter that I wrote to Banier for 15 years one to two times a day.
From the time I had come, I and Françoise could never talk."
The State Representative in Nanterre re-considered that the negotiation of the applicant was not authorised, more than that the supervisory judge in those days refused her request for the initiation of a procedure to issue a legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt's totally able to reach the court, not under protection or care.
"Nobody else to act for her," confirmed the representative of the procurement, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be authorised at the start of the process.
Manual revolution or the end of economic intellectuality?
Nothing changes in the management of big French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intellectuals was unfair...
For more than ten years, when the management of large companies has been conducted against the employees with fire access to users before marketing revolution: it is to be that the employees should have co-operated with the "valuations" set out from the time when they were required to introduce the products that have been taken from the head of the company technicians' ideas.
Though the client became the centre of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the marketing strategy to obtain the market by the right direction...and when the authoritary efforts to introduce products different to the trade preferences are regularly returned!
The access of employees can lead to death demoralization.
Manufacturers in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much larger general phenomenon that contains majorly management codes.
This democracy affects the development of all intellectual enterprises, including research and development, and what is more important, economic intelligence.
In fact, the EI "requires from all participants... active access and ability to predict" and requires the employees of commitments that are completely in contrast with the income of authorisation management.
That is why we call for a manager revolution that should be put to the business interest center as a customer.
Relate the use of internal investigations of public change.
Internal surveys of public exchange - as a questionnaire submitted to the employees of Orange - contribute to revolution in manager procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid no one.
Majorly because I have already convinced myself that the face in the face of newation is the structure of different departments, especially to... what she did!
In addition, because the authorisation, as one of the patology of power, increases relatively the commitment to its own failures.
And finally, because the majority of the leaders of the work has a simple view of human behaviour.
Because they are high schools for engineers, they have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
With the view of the ideas, they gain old behaviorist theory, currently revived "neuroconscious" from the United States and broadly broadcast without knowledge of the decade institutions and media.
With the possibility of moving "employment" (sic) of managers, he showed the recent investigation of the Ipsos Agency on Figaro.fr pages, which only confirms the management of work in their position of mechanical management, inadequate for today's world.
Determine and measure the mobilization factors.
Instead, managing revolution is necessary for the rational function of modern businesses, it provides the acceptance of the final vision of human behaviour.
It consists in the conclusion of the basic attention to all purposes and practices of the management: For employees, the commitments to the company may be only when they are enjoyed as an appeal to reach their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of the motivation of employees will only kill the Motivative analysis.
These studies showed that it values their enterprises on the basis of a determined duxy that allows them to evaluate what they offer to achieve their live objectives.
Thanks to the identification and monitoring of these mobilization factors, leading work can control, predict and anticipate their "social performances" and introduce their management of human resources "in the right way".
This creates a living ground for development solid and effective economic intellectuality.
A manifestation from Osla: "Justifying War" Obama served praise from the right side.
The American rights welcomed the presentation that Barack Obama had presented before it in Osla, satisfied by the holder of Nobelov's peace price for 2009 in the concept of "justific war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who were first mixed to grant the price of Obam on October 9 this time, including Sarah Palin's former candidates to the Vice-President in elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, she declared Palin, the Museum of the Right Republican Crystal, for the US Today journal, and added that she had been "necessary" wars in her memories that were just exciting.
War is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to have to work, but it's necessary.
All terrorists have to keep there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his preacherGeorge W. Bush, justified the sending of forces in Osla on Thursday and used the evidence to explain his decision to send another 30 000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before.
The next Obam's counterfeit, Newt Gingrich, assessed that the president took a very good job in Osla.
I think the presentation was really very good, welcomed by the former President of the Sneemvni representatives, who assessed the mainly "existence of evil in the world".
In my way, I thought this show was totally historical, I declared Gingrich during the conversation in the "The Takeaway" order.
The former lawyer, which some consider as a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections for 2012, was overwhelmed to see the "live President" to recall the members of the Nobel Price Committee that they would not be free and could not give a price for peace if the use of the power had not existed.
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of George W. Bush, now the editor of Washington Post, Obama suggested "very American evidence".
Not simply as a "global" as it were, but "he spoke as a American President" and reminded the Europeans that they lived in a safe bubble that they did not themselves, and that they did not do too much to keep it," Gerson evaluated.
Among the few insatisfactors from a number of rights belongs to Bush's ears, an ex-shower in the United Nations John Bolton, which showed the "uniform, bubble, and without inspiration", as he indicated on the National Review Online pages.
On the left of the President, for example, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinish is scared by looking at Barack Obam, justifying the use of force.
"When we put war into the wallet of justice, we can easily reject the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-level pressure remains a celebration against the president.
Although Los Angeles Times continues to consider the payment of the price of the peace to Obam as a preliminary, he evaluated his outcome as "unweek" and it also for a speaker known by his talent.
The evidence from Osla should serve as a guide to international decisions in the solution of conflicts, in combating poverty and attack," the Californian journal is devastated.
Obama, "he made a manifestation which was necessary," evaluated New York Times, and the expression indicated "for simple and learnable".
Road carriers: three maratons for a agreement to save the delivery of the resources on Christmas.
After three maraton acts, the Committees of Road Transporters and TLF, the only organization of employees who remained until the end, on Friday evening to the agreement, which ended the challenge to the station and threat that was over the delivery of the resources to the birthday.
The State Secrete for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, during the fifth signature of the agreement, issued "radost" after a number of negotiations that began in the middle.
After the second night, the negotiators discussed on Friday soon with the opinion that the version of the agreement would be signed as far as the end of the afternoon.
And even though three employees organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) were dismissed from negotiation.
But there was a need for more than six hours of meeting that started at 11 hours to all agree and to sign the agreement in 18 hours.
This conflict "will be very harmful to businesses" and "will threaten the danger of breaking the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau stated.
The text text contains an increase of 4% in the lowest payments (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% in the highest payments (international transport).
The amount of hours at the lowest payment shall be increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but it's behind the effort, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Today we're giving our members order to do that not to block, no blocks of resource center.
But there can be a few more resistants that are not peaceable, "added.
Philippe Grillot, President TLF, welcomed the "right agreement", even though it was difficult to admit increased high payments in view of international competition. "
Accordingly, 170 euros per month will be increased in the lowest mixtures and 100 to 120 euros in the highest.
It is an agreement on healthy mind and respect for employees, declared CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "histo-Accord".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT) it's a "admissible compromise".
The Agreement also provides revaluation of travel expenditure at 3% and a report on the status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also enable the 13th payment and modernization of collective composition.
Bussereau recalled the "decreasing of EUR 100 million on taxes from the companies" that was the subject of the changement of government to the 2009 budget law, which was voted on Thursday on Thursday.
The Government requests the Senate for "compatible" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to be first applied to the enterprises that are members of this organization to take the whole work in the case of the extent of the Ministry of Work.
The consequences "in the shortest termin," Bussereau entrusted.
The whole process can only deal with the unconformity of employees' organizations.
The FNTR organization is talking about "bad trade" because 100 million euros were offered to the sector in the compensation of the carbon tax part.
The State Secretary for Transport has offered us to make new negotiations in the light of the mutual analysis, but it has been a challenge to do so that he does not want to cross the crowds in the nearby holiday holidays.
For the Second Organization, the agreement will be threatened in the next 12 months "to be buried a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises".
RER A: a break of transport on the weekend, the committees are uncomfortable with the RATP transport undertaking.
The interruption of transport on the RER-A-lines, which is the largest town-country transport line in France, will also continue during the weekend, since the week-end negotiations between the committee and the management of RATP have not led to any specific results in the question of premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, then, the days of a important purchase week before Christmas, the walls will be driven only between 10 and 20 hours, on the main range (in La Defence and Nation) will carry every other influence, outside this link only one of four.
The SNCF connection will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and the travelers will so be required to stop on another influence.
The business houses of Galeries Lafayette, which expects every day more than 200 000 clients, welcomed the fact that "RATP was trying to make a safe connection with large business houses".
Linka RER A leads from west to east of Paris aglomeration.
The assignment of RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Wednesday, there was one of the two and practically none of the constructions in the shop, as it was in the plan.
Like on Thursday, the people of Ile de France were equipped differently, and he did not control the deadlines.
So soon it was at the Station Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) many less people than habits, notwithstanding otherwise because they missed age and students.
Jack Nbakin, engineer, 29 years from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he was raised about "a hour and a half ago to be sure he'd come on time."
Saint-Lazare was not overflowed, reported by the SNCF State railway, the most useful number of guardians and guards had been predicted.
RER A SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut have come or gone from Saint-Lazare's purchase with an addition to metro.
Other Values of the existing shall be made on Saturday and Sunday to evaluate the results of the weekend afternoon meeting, which the Committees have evaluated as "low".
The RER leads to negotiations on the special protocol for the RER A-shops on all pages, the adjustment of work and time, the course of carrier, etc.
However, there is no matter what the drivers who require a deserved premium, according to Thierry Garona.
The RATP has even made a delay on the premium, which threatened the CGT with the fact that the leading "is not able to solve a problem while the travellers and the SNCF did it."
On a new meeting, which is planned on Monday, "the submissions of calling are closely reviewed," the RATP transport companies.
What was the reason why the experts think that the business "does out of weekly traveling."
At the next hour, approximately 150 drivers had a business committee in its Paris seat.
The leadership, which afterwards rejected any discussion during the stage, was therefore decided to meet the "cool" interest.
It is dangerous that the conflict in the deterioration will be expanded even on the RER B line, after the Uns and the independent will announce the stability of staff.
The committees ask for premiums from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, from which 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South (Jih), Indépendants (Ondependents)) and deploy the harmful work of the submination of this line, which will carry out millions of travellers daily.
The RER Officer shall produce a carriage of 2200 to 2700 euros in the past and 600 to 650 euros for an unregulated worktime and for work on Sunday and holidays.
The Turkish Justice has decided for the Kurdish party and this decision has a difficult effect.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday that the major pro-Kurd parties in the country would be rejected. This decision immediately called protests in the Kurd Community on the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may significantly complicate the task of the Government who is trying to give the Kurdish community to a friendly hand and try to finish 25 years of conflict.
The Partie for the Democracy Company (DTP) was released because it became "nearly the activities of the threatening independence of the State and its independent units," reporters said the President of the High Court of Hasim Kilic after four days of negotiation.
The decision was adopted uniquely on 11 judges when the parties needed seven votes, Kiliç introduced and added that 37 side-quarters, in the case of her President Ahmeta Turkey and lady Aysely Tuglukov, had prohibited political life for five years.
The Court also announced the cancellation of the parliamentary immunity that Mr Turk and Mrs Tugluk used and confiscated the property of the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP page has 21 letters in Parliament (from 500).
The leadership of the party has already warned the statement that the lawyers will leave the Parliament before they act as Members without political responsibility in it.
The decision is to continue the process started in 2007 by the Cascate Court Procurer Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who charges DTP from obeying the "commands" of the Working Parties of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider as a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legal political vitry of rebels from PKK.
The Party assures that it does not have any "based connection" with the PKK but refuses to mark it as a terrorist organization and invites the Government to negotiate with it.
The Court Verdict comes on the moment when the Government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and trys to restrict the support of the Kurds against the PKK and to end such conflict.
The DTP leader confirmed that the resolution of the party could lead to the renewal of the pressure on the south-east of Anatolia, where in recent weeks a lot of demonstrations against the substrates for which the leader of PKK Abdullah Öcalan was held in the police centres.
From the notification of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have been seated before the DTP seat in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south-east, both of which are mostly Kurds.
Police was used by the skin granates and water works, the demonstrators again shot Moloto's cocktails or shot stones from the stairs.
It also demonstrated some hundreds of people in Istanbul.
After the statement, Mr. Turk said that the decision of justice was only "proclaiming deficiency".
Turkey cannot solve this question (Kurds, Mr. red.) by the prohibition of the party, he declared printing.
The Government, established by the part of the Islamic Motion, also judged this decision.
We're from the principles against the disruption of the side.
It doesn't solve anything, he announced the Ministry of Energy of Taner Yildiz.
This Decision is a perfect shot of democracy increasingly declined from the government, commented by the Politologist Ahmet Island.
We can understand that we can expect the response from PKK, added.
On Thursday, the PKK was invited to one of the most murdered attacks northern Turkey, who killed seven soldiers for three days before.
Snow can come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to shake the citizens, he says the leader of the winter of the FES Technical Services.
But so that his employees could try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
The weekend could come to this first, according to the horologists.
It is prepared over 300 employees and 120 vehicles to take care of snow and ice.
FES shall, however, act in accordance with the precise plan.
When they snow in Frankfurt totally and the temperatures fall under zero, they will go to 20 taking appeals and big snippets, Brauburger explains.
These incidences belong to the main and transit taxes such as Neweweg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also advances for farmers, local public transport lines, nice areas and streams with breaking like Atzelbergstraße.
FES service begins in three hours.
In the case of needs, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to cover a lower salt that is better holding, some about 1040 miles [1040 km].
That's why the FES starts in three hours a night, "to be the roads free, when it starts the transport to work."
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the leader of the winter technology services, "for no one is willing to make the weapons a place."
At the same time, when it is so deceived, there are a number of communications incoming and proclaiming, among which also belongs to Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority of the side and the outside road.
Brauburger knows they'll get there.
In five hours, the FES's road will be exposed, mainly dangerous places and transitions will be eradicated.
FES can't take care of all cyclostics.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that follows from 22 to 4.30 primarily, Brauburger says.
Since the lever is created on them, it goes out immediately when the temperature falls under two degrees.
In the case of need, they're also calling the police.
Dinosaur colebe
Your hallae looked like a combination of other dinosaures: The animal was two meters long and 1,50 meters high running after two strong back-coats, had a floor of a liver with a swimming, deceased teeth, short fronts with slow trees and long ocases.
If this kind lived about a few million years ago, it wouldn't be an extraordinary thing.
Sterling Nesbitt of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the fourth magazine of Science writes that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaures with these physical characters.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in the New Mexico today, which was at the same time in the supercontinent of Pange.
Your opens a new window for the early evolution of dinosaures, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot of neighborhoods, extensions and knowledge of early dinosaures.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began to be buried in Ghost Ranch north of New Mexico.
Sometimes, on one day, we found twelve dinosaural bones, which is not known for triases, informs the member of the team Randall Irmis from Museum of Natural History in Utahu.
Some of the bones identifyed the people as a new species.
During the outgroup, the rests were collected with a total of five units.
Find confirms the theory about the early history of dinosaures.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun God of the Indians Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitta, it's an unusual finding: "Fosiles of dinosaures from triass are very rare, mostly they'll be found only single alomics."
Other dinosauries experts do not share this extent without any exemption.
Especially sensitive this finding is not, but confirms some theory about the early history of dinosaures, Martin Sander says of the University in Bonna.
According to the current view of decade, the dinosauries were first discovered about 230 million years ago.
As regards the oldest phosphiles, it is not complete, therefore the addment of pradinosaures is increasingly contrary.
Experts, for example, discuss the time when they have already been divided into three most important development lines: the massage of therapy, which later belonged to Tyranosaurus king, Velociraptor and birds, the "long-ground" sauropodi and their family, and the species of Ornithischia (petroleum), such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Your hallae is after Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues are therapeutical.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the Tawa Hallae library, for example, researchers found evidence of air woven, which also have the beasts of the birds.
Thanks to the air vacuum, the breathing of birds is more efficient than the sugars.
At Tawa Hallae, even the bones of the feet were obviously filled with air.
The Tawa is the oldest and the most priority therapy with airwakes, Randall Irmis.
Since the family line of major sorpeds had also laid down air and light bones, this useful innovation was probably a common front of both groups.
Minimum three holes in North America
Since the most priority of the dinosaures lived in South America, the exporters exported that there were the first place.
According to this, three development lines were divided soon and spread from South America to all continents that then, as supercontinent Pangea, made a single earthly mass.
She would also say that the team found along with Tawa Hallae remaining two other, not especially the strength of family terapeuts.
These three can't be buried from one common, immigrated preacher, the arguments are.
We believe that it has reached at least three holes in North America, says Alan Turner from American Museum of Natural History in New York, together with the study.
Of course, there are also resolutions.
Another older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of most difficult dinosaures, lived in Poland today, says a bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give inherited images, because in South America there remained very many primitive phosphilies of dinosaur, and the final continents are rarely found.
As the dinosaurs showed that the relatively rare line of plasma generations has developed to governing land-based farmers at the middle of the earth, it remains still a deceased.
During the trias, the dinossars shared their life room with many other places, such as the former crocodiles and flying jackets, and without number of other jackets.
At the end of the tria, dinosauries spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the family died and crossed the tria and the jury.
The history of success was not supported
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, Martin Sander says.
It could have reached the mass mixture that dinosaur's survived in a case, but the plague is not.
Or the dinosaures had better adjusted, so they could exhaust competition.
The history of success did not endure everyone fully.
About 150 million years ago, it helped to a different group of animals that also developed in the tria and lived in the shadow since the time of shadows.
Solidarity from Vidano after Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatures are international.
In the list, Professors are Toronto, of Cambria, Vide universities or Berkeley in California.
They joined themselves with Neapol, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paula, Berlin or Brem.
The police office of the occupied casin of the French Goethe University took care of the world's disturbance.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth University, but also high schools throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarized with protesting students in Westend campus.
In the statement of the German and English writes, the president "not approved" of the police principles.
Because the walls and art works were discharged, the University President Werner Mezzaer-Estler left the building that they had been conceived last week by students and overseers.
At the same time, five students were hurt.
The damage of the matters, the judges of the signatory, does not justifie "violent release of self-organized students and teachers of police commands".
The claim represents "unacceptable principle" to the freedom of research and otherwise.
The advertising of vandalism serves to "unrighteousness and criminalization of protest" and takes attention from the areas.
The Presidency has dismissed the needed discussion.
Predicting call for the stop of criminal offences.
It states that the rate of existing people has not supported significant damage.
Permitted Protection
Youths of the Committee Organization of Verdi and the German committee association are also solidarized by students.
Protest is a legitimate expression that increases concern for its own future, says the secret earthly young Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessen ministers of Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) have yet been processed by the university president and police.
We're grateful to the University President.
Destructions and occupations are completely inacceptable, said on Thursday in Current Stunde (Actual Hour) in the Weisbaden's earthly snow.
We have a sense of protest, but we don't have any understanding of vandalism, said the lawyer of the country's snow to the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition group of SPD, Green and Links.
The CDU takes the decorated walls to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Li©).
Instead of compliance with the arguments and requests of students, there was a claim.
Linke gave us an invitation to the Ministry of the Inside to submit a report on the police seat.
New Silicon-Valley
A long year was paid for a secret city that was not accessible for visiting the west.
Greenograd, one of the ten periods of Moscow's main city, in Soviet Swazi, was a closely watched location where a secret weapon research was carried out.
Today, this period is considered with 216 000 residents from the Moscow center as "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres located here.
Since September 2008, Greenograd representatives have contacted the French Deck Centre Riedberg - with university institutions and firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits and signed in the middle of Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Hard Cooperation".
The Russian delegation led the Moscow majorist Jurij Rosljak and the prefect from the Greenograd Anatolij Sēnov, for Frankfurt signed the leader's planning reporter Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, the representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will be carried out by natural scientific research for seminars in Greenograd.
Scientific exchange
It's about the depth exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
The FIZ firm will be enabled to catch on the growing Russian market.
Instead, Russian firms want to get prohibitions in Germany.
Greenograd is a seat of significant Russian research institutions and companies.
They belong to Moscow electronic technology, large concerns of Sitronics and Russian electronica.
The period was established in 1958 as a "socialistic planned city" for weapons research.
Greenograd (the "Green City" translation) obtained its name according to the frozen lands where research equipment are installed.
Stuttgart Speed
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not enough to be prepared.
It is simply "new Europe's heart".
All right. S21 is more than the start of trailing, more than the monstrosy building, which will take the main city of Badenska-Württemberska for a decade in a devastated building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was raised from the spirit of the 80s.
The main station with railways that ended in the centre of the city was then considered as a transport-technical physician in the 19th century, which acted as a fast modern railway, because there was a lot of time to overcome lokomotive backwards.
I'm busy, I'm gonna stop, go on, so it should work.
That's why it's the main instructions: in Frankfurt and Mnich.
And in Stuttgart: the transitional trans-European railways between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, therefore, the slogan of "Europe's heart".
It is actually started with S21, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible.
The very ambitional projectors themselves knew that the start of the building is almost unfinanciable in Hessen and Bauern.
Since the time there are modern cycle woods with motor and driver vehicles on both ends, they have no main reliefs with the eating and exiting problems.
Yet: Stuttgart 21 begins with an early new ICE trace in Ulma.
The landscape and communal policies have processed it.
The roads cooperate, even because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is a tax payer and not a State counterpart.
The Urbanist project is able to be excused on the same way.
There will be a new city room that - if we believe computer images of projectors - will include many green.
For the railway transport system, S21 is harmful.
Transitional traits and traits exposures are designed for personal transport, which - typically in the 80s - have adequate growth.
It wasn't the competition of the league flights.
Modern transport policy must go, but first to strengthen cost transport, because railway transport is far more environmental than cost cars on the road.
But the new trail is not due to any fitting suitable for cost wheels.
More important is that S21 is directly addressing many other railway projects.
In Sweden, good six billion euros were to be acquired.
That's the official number.
Experts consider real ten to 15 billion.
It is expected that in the next decade, there will be no financing for other deficiency points and difficult places in the network.
There are sixty-first projects on the list of the Transport Ministry.
One of the most important is the building of about 180 miles [100 km] long road through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the road has been made a relaxed temper.
Here's the need to be stuck.
But S21 will be like a race.
The tragedy of Rina's doll becomes the heat of the international cost transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment of the aircraft
The Earth Government has been opened in the Weisbaden's earthly snow if it is against the judgment of the Hessen's Court of Justice (VGH) concerning the prohibition of night-years and allows it to revise.
The CDU/FDP coalice confirmed the experts to judge more than 400 pages of VGH, said the Ministry of Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today in writing claimed that in the case of the planned North-West ravage of the French airport, it should be re-modified.
The authorisation of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as the earthly government predicts, does not conform to the law of the protection of residence against the night aircraft.
The coal must be decided by 4 January if it will require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticized this decree and focused on the representatives of the Government to report the review of the Social Administrative Court in Libya.
SPD Fraction Boss Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invited CDU and FDP to return to the promises about the prohibition of nights that she had given before the selection. Otherwise, it is possible to be valued as a "broken word".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, he said the head of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir in the square on the optional Slagan FDP "We keep our word".
Minister Posch has refused Schäfer-Gümbel's outcome, the earthly government is trying to get to its nights.
Exact legal control of his time.
Coalice doesn't want to work on the "the first income".
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Mezzaer (FDP).
The years of his fraction to the prohibition of nights have never been like the opposition he gives them.
American banks payment aid
Americans, the crises of great banks are dismissed from the State paths.
Bank of America payed aid in the middle of the Tarp Bank Reserve Fund for $45 billion (approximately $30 billion).
According to the report of the CNBC station, Citigroup also plans to pay State aid.
The institutions so want to dismiss the limitation of money - the limitation of bonus payments to the managers and the refund of high payments.
Bank of America has been aware of the changed obligation of 19 billion dollars of pure money in the investors.
The residue of the amount was taken out of its staff, which was filled outside otherwise by the sales of the officers.
Kenneth Lewis bank boss in the middle of the evening expressly thanked the American tax payer: The money injection helped us to overcome a hard time.
The money establishment has lost the financial crisis on the top of Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
Citigroup wants to be released from its commitments to the State by providing money on the market.
The NCB was informed with the resource that this American bank could already report on Thursday an increase in the amount of approximately 20 billion dollars.
Citigroup's speaking didn't want to do that.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already been spent help.
Quick Option
It just happened before it was waiting.
The station presented the representative only two weeks after the ZDF Governing Board extracted from the office of the Sheriffer Nikolause Brender.
I wanted to agree with that person last night.
Peter Frey, the leader of ZDF in the main town in Berlin, was marked as a favorite.
But the station did not confirm it - officially that she would not predict the process.
But the role could also play that they didn't want to damage ZDF Markuse Schächter's incitant if this would not pass by the Governing Board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, support nine of 14 members of the gram.
The voting result was not known before the conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, she was in the Governing Board of Schätter with her opinion to continue with Nikolaus Brender for five years ago.
For Brender only voted seven members, seven were against him. Brender's missing mandate was a bitter destruction for Schächter, although she had been expected.
The EU's advice has signed a few weeks ago that it does not want to confirm Brender in the office.
The opposite to the shepherd organized the Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused further detention in the Office of a highly appreciated shepherd by the argument that Brender had decreased the rate of monitoring of ZDF reporting.
Thus, until a short time before the election, the protests were criticized by the political impact on ZDF.
In the past, even 35 national laws were intended to deal with Coch's procedure as an anticipation.
It wasn't for anything.
About
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, my pedagogics and my romantics.
Then he worked for Southwest and Frankfurter.
1983, Frey went to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Next station: 1988 to 1990 the personal rapporteur of the shepherd; 1991/92 a letter in Washington; to 1998 the leader and modernist "Morgenmagazins"; to 2001 the leader of the ZDF policy; since that time the leader of the ZDF main study.
After Brender, who was chosen in the middle by the Medium Magazin journalist of the year, attended the Green that they were given a constitutional complaint.
Love anti-candidate in the right advice, the Russian-Falc Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the country should change the state with ZDF so that the personal pensions of the incitant could not be blocked with political motivation.
Beck also refused to eliminate side policy from the ZDF monitoring Council.
Brender's proposed representative Peter Frey has ordered the wise shock-shooter - unless Brender's meeting criticised for this very hard-gremium.
Thanks to this evidence of journalal independence, he could nominate him on the place of the shepherd without loss of faces and Schätter, so he could be released by the right advice, without being doubted that the party would be transferred to the office.
In the side arithmetic, Frey's increasingly linked to the left liberals.
It's free of haram'dy
Partial success for students: After the year of establishment, the Ministers of Culture and High School Ministers finally entered into the social country on Thursday: In the Ministry of Culture and High School Rectors, both sides agreed that it is likely to improve the studies for bacteria and magistrates.
Students should be able to carry out their study in the future.
In particular, it was agreed that the tests were reduced: In principle, each study module should be completed once.
Furthermore, the work of students should be checked, and it should ensure "real and comprehensive peace".
Policy and high schools want to simplify the recognition of tests between high schools in Germany and foreign.
Member States are binding to create more flexible structural tasks for bactalary and magister studies.
The earthquake should stop existing.
Lower test
From the beginning of student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors had confirmed words of better study.
Now they're first filled with a specific area.
Such the Accreditation Council concluded that the tests are partly reduced by the drast: "Each module will be completed just once a trial," it is written in a 30-page report that is partly to regulate the approval of studies.
"Goodly lower trial," stated the President of the Accreditation Council of Reinhold Grimm, "the wrong development must be stopped, which has expressly limited the graduation of the study."
To this end, it must be a "studiing rate" in the future "decisive criteria" in the implementation.
Modules and areas are "determined to be strongly checked" to "too limite students at the choice
Seminars."
Students should "income to a space that allows and supports its own initiative".
The rules must be paid by approval of new studies, after review, but also for the current study.
This is needed to "pre-acredit" every five years, which, however, means that it will dure until 2015 before all studies are checked.
The responsibility for this is ten credit agencies throughout Germany, which support the accreditation Councils established by the national countries.
Cultural Ministers called the "social" country in October to act on the agencies so that it was not too large and the test regime is not strict.
The universities and high schools have already been agreed in individual countries with the country's ministerials on appropriate measures.
As a result, the only country has promised the additional provisions for the further development of the Bolivia process.
In particular, high schools should be designed for conference programmes and study advice, and strengthening experimental and foreign authorities.
They want countries and high schools to invest ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to give a new high school law to Parliament.
It states that only one test should be required to finish the study module.
Study training should be more flexible, to ensure recognition of tests from other high schools and to facilitate access to the master.
All studies in the country should be checked until the end of the next year.
Governments and oppositions were resurrected on Thursday.
The criticism of the resolution was also fallen by the praise.
The Social Representative of High School Groups, Juso, urged the creation of educational policy to be not involved in the future "with the closed doors" of Ministers and High School Directors.
Later after the station, students should also speak to it as a Slovakian.
Buddhist academics also received support from the President of the High School Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday at one meeting with the Ministry of Culture, with which HRK was working on a common reform report.
According to the Committees of Education and Education (GEW) the Bonns resolution was not sufficiently far: They require a legal sentence that would enable access to the constitutional magister study to each individual with a battle title.
Secondly, social countries must ensure that for today’s generation of bacteria students there are enough places in the magister areas with the best studies, member of the GEW Andreas Keller.
Member States have to work far more translators.
The Ministers of Culture, however, did not have access to the magister programs.
More than a note under the star to Herta MÃ©er
To get to Germany and out there is a nice, almost no control..." sounds the introductory line of Werner Sjöner's bastard, who is the subject of the experience with the encouraging of a disident who has received freedom, but has come about his tongue.
Werner Sørner was born in 1951 in the Roman Banato, first worked as a German and English factor in Bukurest, and started as a lector of a child’s neighborhood, and in 1982 he moved to Frankfurt over Mohan.
Sjöner was designed by different literary prices, 1993, and he was the leader of the Hesen Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt since 2002.
A significant microliterary disturbance has occurred in the past attack on one seminar in Mnich, on which the "Germany" was in Romania in view of its security acts.
Obviously, the disappointed and injured Sjöner left a statement in which the Romanian writers, Richard Wagner, William Totokem, Franzem Hodjak and Helmutem Frauendorfer, recognised to cooperate as a secret informant of the Roman secret Service of Security.
With some of the presents, Sørner received the German language price in 1989.
In the first year of 1971, the increasing increasingly started.
I'm, Sørner continued, "that is someone who didn't care enough of trying to fear the Security."
The officer Werner Sörner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time with the grant of the Nobelovy price of Herta Mezzaer and its inappropriate literary arrangement with the mechanisms of the Dictatoral Government is a letter scene, and in particular the community of German authors who entered from Romania is deteriorated by the case that indicates the depth and harmness of the political system which is based on control and spying.
Werner Sørner is not, at least if it can be said according to the advanced state of knowledge, just a coach, but it's also a victim.
In the Security Acts, the secret agent Walter's role played, said after Sørner's recognition Michael Markel and refused to have a positive influence on himself by the secret agent Walter.
"He highlighted me" at that time, in all the basic points, Markel says.
It's moral obligation to make this note.
The statement of the speaker was in this form and before this public was unexpected, but it is not a surprising recognition of the former disident and its cooperation with the Roman secret service.
Herta Mezzaer already wrote in July when she read her own acts, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for spikes Security.
Topics, which can be assumed, will speculate, and in some cases, as well as the name is hidden by the crystals called Sorin, Voice and Walter.
Other than in foreign, while a very certain view of Stazi's folder, the manipulation with the remaining Security control is still very difused.
In the past years, the systematic light was mature and limited.
One of the Birthler Boards, which corresponds to the National Council to the processing of Securitat (CNSAS), was first established in 1999, the issue of the act has been conducted more longer since that period.
Since 2005, there is a law governing the administration of the members.
The fact that the members of the Security may still have a great effect in Romania, he added a discussion in which one of the former Security boss from Temeshvara reported on the carrier's refusal assessment.
He's psychology, the ends were only listened once.
The potential confirmation was completely uncovered in the form of free expression.
Of course, the case of Shâlner, as in the case of the injured prosecution, comes from unexpected questions.
The special reaction of the listeners to Sørner's recognition is to expect that the continuation of this hall will determine the desire of advertising more than after adding the wine and the stud.
For the geneze of Herty Mezzaer, who accepted Nobel price last night, it's more than a note under the star.
Shared Champions League income
It seemed to come a purely dressed business representative from a divorced holiday dinner, on which the manufacturer of the sports goods of sweetness was distributed when he went on a fourth hour after midnight to the C class called mercedes, the new trainer VfBr Christian Gross in the delivery of oral colored sponsor.
A man with a marking dance was allowed to carry him in a town elsewhere.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and the drinking lucky was also a 55-year-old man.
It was a good evening, but tomorrow he'll continue to work.
Or it's just going to start.
The words at the first three days of the engaged Switzerland: "We have reached octo-final", but in Champions League thanks to the Urziceni Union from Romania, "but we can't let us succeed: it will be brutally strong fight against the stepping."
"More important tasks" stand before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the real estate of the king's class and in the usual human days.
And avoid the re-obvious weaknesses after three Maricy (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11).
Location
Osmifinal Champions League (from 16./17. + 23./24 February/profession 9.10. + 16./17 March) will be lost 18.
So the joy of Babbel’s three-third approach will remain maintained.
Not only in a genuine medication, which has added to uncertain Stuttgart professionals during a short time of self-consciousness, the will of sharing and joy of games.
I went to the players, and I told them that he had to move on his strong pages and I asked them to be more courageous, explained the doctor of the soul Gross so simplely a successful receipt that, but for the action of Babbel's therapy, was no longer ability.
He reflected a certain magic, acknowledged Babbel's advice Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the battle, sometimes there are things you wouldn't think like possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a few weeks of breaks caused by hurt, became the best player on the spell, trying to describe the "fenomen" detected by the vocabulary "cursity" and the work by the procedures of the new superposed: "It's a man who is radical and requires disciplin.
That's what we are currently."
It obviously missed for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet been saved, warns sports and president Horst Heldt
The VFB Stuttgart is more stability.
As Gross, no players and managers want to oversee the victory against the weak replacement and absolutely harmful defense of the Roman host.
They would also win in Glasgow before a worst waking after destruction 0:4 in Leverkusean, Khedir considers.
And sport; President Horst Heldt recalled that although one goal was achieved in the same, the other is still far.
We're not behind water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after the first victory after three months, it was caused by weekend events, which sincerely experienced in the form of television conversation with Jens Lehman just before the beginning of the storage.
There's a decision that acts other than Jens, he took Heldt to Lehman's critical force.
He preached the representation of a weak lead and decided to change the trainer after the pressure of pubertical fans.
Even that his free day was canceled after the bathroom, Lehmann marked as a sign of missing sovereignty and dependence.
The Lehman's words "formulated pure egoism," he dealed with Heldt and announced the consequences of the lawyer.
Both four - centuries will have no joy in life.
Everyone is too worth one of the finals that without the work of a meeting trener team, it would not be possible to play so strong and fighting.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share in success," they said Heldt and Lehmann singlely - and a man with an igelite sack agreed.
World Mystery Sovereign in Hard Way
Young dual in Berna: Kevin Johnson's exhibitor continued to produce words and gestures of the world of Vitalia Klička.
However, after twelve strong wheels, Ukrainian decreased his title in the hard weight of the WBC boxer organization.
The Court of Decisions was a single vote.
Hamburg - Vitalij Click remains a world master in a box in difficult weight.
The 38-year WBC campaign struck the night on the Sabbath in Berna American Kevin Johnson on the points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klica, this is the third successful deal of the title after its return in October 2008.
Earlier, the Ukrainian was a worldwide master of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to all who were expected.
The call has improved its balance on 39 winnings in 41 professional campaigns, he has been deceived two times because of hurt.
Johnson was first destroyed in 24 battles.
Before approximately 17,000 birds in Bernish arena, he led 2,02 meters high Click summer, especially with his left.
On 11 metres smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Click Ear, but downloaded in front of the mister of the world, so Click couldn't make a decision to his dangerous arrow.
In all that, Johnson's papa made a little bit to the accommodator and just tried to get into the other rounds.
Although the chain produced words and gestures, his wheels, but the master of the world's trefils only a few times.
But it's just the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fighted with Click with twelve rounds.
The prosecutor took care of breakfast in Switzerland's main city before the fight.
He hurt Click as a "oppressive zombies" that "nobody's right."
During the wheat on Thursday, he left the champion out, he dropped Johnson from the nose of the sun-brell, "to see his eyes."
Fourth winning after Clique Return
After its return on 11 October 2008, the clock remained unprecedented.
After almost four years of breaking, he struck Samuel Peter in Berlin in Nigeria and took out the "sue" WBC feet, which had to drive before it without war.
In this year, he struck Juan Carlose Gomez from Cuba and in September Chrise Arreola from the United States.
I got only one and physically in a good form in this campaign, I put Click back to the ring.
But his dream remains in all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the master of the world of WBO and IBF.
WBA's wearing but Brit David Haye, after he sits on November 2,13 meters high Nicolay Vulajev.
Haye rejected the fight against Click in the year, which was planned on September.
It has been planned by his promotorship company against Click at the London Wembley Stadium.
Case Kunăz
The family attack from opposition: The Chief of the Green Jürgen Trittin's fraction named for wrong information about the affection of Kun ·z Ministry of the Defense of Guttenberg for lying.
SPD and Linke (Le日) calls a Officer to give an explication.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest announcements for the attack on Kun·z, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defense of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has allowed a household claim.
Minister for the death bombing of two cisters in September said "the science of the wrong," he said the head of the Green Jürgen Trittin Fraction in the Sabbath reporting order ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it a obscure expression: lying.
The order to kill was issued in the non-compliance with the rules of international security support forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the foundation of the NATO message that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Wednesday, it showed that when the attack was attacked, only the destruction of the charged cars, but the purpose of killing two leaders of Talibán.
At the American attack, who requested the German leader Kun·zu, Colonel Klein, came under the NATO investigation to kill or hurt up to 142 people.
Green, SPD and Linke invited Angela Merkel's Office on the Sabbath to submit immediately before the College Snippet and also explained what Guttenberg had given about this event.
Mrs. Merkel must explain whether the target strategy for the killing of the part of the Afghanistan Social Snow Policy - and, if the Office, Bundeswehr and the rapporteur service had approved this new strategy, they called Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from the Green Renate Künast.
Ulrich Wilhelm's language government denied the criticism.
The Office of Office does not have any effect on a specific set of Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, said.
On Saturday, there was also a vote of doubts on the counting of the Ministry on the background of the Wolfgang Schneiderhan General Inspector and the State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg were correctly and completely informed about the attack on the cistern.
Officially it was noted that the NATO reports had to be supported and to shut down sensitive details to the Minister.
However, from both top officials, they warned the Ministry of Defense even to a few reports, including the two-side document of Major Colonel Klein and one report of the military police.
"Frankfurter Generaler Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had to ask for a letter to explain.
It is said he hasn't received any answer yet.
The Ministry did not show the outcome on the Sabbath and showed that this would be resolved in the Research Committee on Social Snow, which will be established in the next center.
The world of dreams
Some see the image in a wide state and hear the voices that endlessly don't see and don't hear.
Not only mentally sick or drug-related, the border between imagination and age.
As long as it comes in the sleep, everything's okay.
When we lie with the closed eyes in our dark room, we must be surrounded by the most wonderful ideas and fantasy confusions.
But whoever lives in the care of dreaming, sees and hears things that endlessly do not see and not hears, pays in the west world today for foolish or drug dependent, or at least as a miracle.
However, such images and voices are not only in the psychology of sickness or in drugs.
The wine has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to make houses, draw images or write romanians, are there and there to look forward to the border between sleep, imagination and age.
The dreams changed status of the domain can be displayed in the most different images, in the best case we call them vision, in the worst bludy.
Although the initiator and the initiator can be differed, however, the mysteries of Hildegard von Bingen, the drugs of the prophet New-Age Carlose Castanedy, the shamanic states of blowsing, psychology and hallucination can be removed from similar processes.
Halucinations or visions will occur if the equality of neuronal brain transmissioners - mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonine and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complicated hallucinations and blue thoughts are very often shown in schizofrene psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him.
The association between blue and sleep was employed by philosophy and physicians since the anticipation.
Aristoteles understood the hallucination as a form of dream in a sad state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of modern psychology founders, in 1861, "a big similarity of blowsing with dreams," for Sigmunda Freuda was even a dream of "psychoza, with all the insensitives, overwhelming, sensation."
It's under 2001, Henning T. changes into the comic position.
His body is double-different and cry-colored.
The gravity doesn't have any power over him, it's in the room stream.
It feels to be shot.
Following him, he's stumbled with bloody red grimas, precious teeth.
He follows him, he's buried into ` hard, fire-boats, he's throwing with him on the wall, feeling pain on the whole body.
Voice, bad voices are threatened from the wall and from the wall.
He can't breathe the voices that he trusts and hurts.
Henning T.'s getting two cabs out of the stereo, getting them into the swimming and putting it up on the hack on the street.
He's getting on one player, and he's getting a shit around his head.
Shit.
The smiley's allowing it.
Learn, the rocks of the congregation's voices traveling his bubines, "Go to the clinic and let yourself treat!"
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he lived six acute psychoses, last two years ago, first nearly 20 years ago.
They were running LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoafecti and paranoic psychosis, besides maniodepression, take medicines against depression, mania, schizofrenia.
He learned to live with his sickness, he's married for three years.
I've experienced the worst fear in psychology and the stupidest doubts, he says.
Examples are terrifying
Approximately one percent of people are sick at least one time for the life of schizofreni, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
In acute shizofrene psychosis, it is not possible to distinguish the internal and external world, which can lead to hallucination, size, related illusion or persecution illusion.
It is particularly extended to hear voices - voices that command, comment or lead dialogues.
No optical hallucination is unusual.
The achieved is not able to distinguish significantly from an insignificant, the brain cannot filtrate disturbing signals, and the home is inflated.
Like the dream opens the psychosis, the ideas and fantasy that are buried from the deepest levels of the household.
Reality in psychology is focused on an entity, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, top doctor Clinky General Psychiatrie University Clinics in Heidelberg.
Schäffrenik is located in the center of action, everything has the meaning of it.
Equally, it gets to pass of role, becomes, as in the dream, enabled by events and cannot actively form them.
This is why the shakefrenica often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not the most possible in them, the prospects are terrible, the surprise is disrupted.
One time for life to enjoy hallucination
Otherwise in the dream, says Fuchss, "but the sense and space structure of the human being in psychology is mainly maintained."
Blood thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to decline the survival is in reality.
The scientists are still standing before the throat, why our brain is exactly doing such transmissions.
Excellent states can lead to the short loss of relationship with reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone's going to grow into psychology.
It seems that there is a genetic dispute for schizofreni, but the dual studies showed that genes are not the only determinant factor.
Scientists have a minimum brain damage.
We believe that in the wounding stage of development, the neurological disorder of the brain, such as the virus disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a deceit, as it happens to the destruction of a neuronal system that has not been demonstrated in the long years.
The roles also play environmental impacts - stress or traumatisms can be a psychosis initiator if available to it.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can start psychosis because they include in the transmission system.
When our brain gets closed
It's nice that psychotronics suffer with their hallucinations, and to release them, get them dear medicines, others give money for drugs to get them, says the psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
If we have overlooks as pleasant or inappropriate, it is often just a question.
Kasten has already collected 10 years of reports about hallucinations and overwhelming, in the latest year he interpreted his results in the book "The irreale world in our head" (The Inreal World in our head).
Although the hallucination belongs to typical psychosis delivery feeds, it is also surprisingly many other diseases.
In the case of psychological disorders such as the personality or depression, also often diseases such as migration, epilepsy, disturbed glass or Alzheimer or brain trauma.
It surprisedly hallucinates the real submine and the brain of a healthy human.
Halucinations, according to Kasten, are consistent of the contents of thoughts that are normally treated.
They seem that the parts of the brain in which the sensual opinions are processed are too active or less tough; if our brain is closed, or if it is missing stimulation.
Drogs can start this status as the brain damage or psychology.
But also take stimulation, stress, concern with love or other exceptional states.
In recent studies, at least a third of the questionnaires, at least one time in their lives have been hallucinated.
In 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Meklenbursk-Eastern Poland and walking to a higher gymnasium.
Actually, it's a total normal girl.
If the pictures and voices weren't here.
The stops may be that it's going to feed them with a long, dark hair.
When she answers, she says she's a partner with surprise -- no one sees but her and doesn't hear this boy.
This late girl considers a broken snippet, but Sarah K. hates, she knows.
He's up, he hears and sees that boy, exactly the same as he hears and sees a girl sitting around in the lavice.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a good feeling. He's got that guy.
I'm crazy? He's ever asking.
But he knows that this boy and others are not real and they're going to disappear again.
In the night, the evidence is more evident.
Often they're overwhelming.
When he sits in the class, he can't always follow the learning because the factor in her eyes and ears is just representing a new partner, but he explains all the finally heard and visiblely on the mathematical equation table.
The facts are more evident tonight.
When he waits in his dark room for a dream that comes a little and too late, he can not often discern whether they are up or if he is sleeping, whether images that they see, grimas, or girls with bloody wounds on hands and feet appear before her opened or closed eyes.
Leave me in the room, he's crying for those positions.
She doesn't say anything to parents and friends about it, they would think she was crazy.
Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Vloni made maturity and lived with her friend.
Halucination has occurred a year ago.
Since the time she contacted the psychology of Kasten on the Internet, she knows that she's not crazy.
Fornications are also arts from disfellowship
If someone is socially isolated or is distracted by his stimulans, he will have a great probability of hallucination, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough employment and it's going to take care of his fun.
Sarah K., the only one, had as a little girl fear of the last kids, often played alone.
Her hallucination started when she learned at 13th that a man who told his father from the time he thinks it's not her own father.
Because in visual and acustic hallucinations are active the same brain, which also process real waves and sounds, it is hard to be achieved like Sarah K., to distinguish from themselves bludy and reality. "Every benefit," says Kasten, "sounds in the brain, also reality is displayed there.
Halucinations are also images that allow the brain to produce, so they act so real."
The night dreams also evaluate Kasten as the form of hallucination.
Halucination of healthy people is not essentially different from hallucination in acute psychology.
On the contrary to the skizofrenics, psychic health of people can identify their blues as unreal.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to evaluate hallucination as an extraordinary capacity.
Food condition between sleep and hallucination
In our world, too concentrated on the home, an imaginary use is, despite all, patologyized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chef of Psychiatric and psychotherapeutic clinics of Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychology is a difficult, suffering disease, but it also brings positive, creativeness - the overwhelming is also the art of disfellowship.
Schmidt-Degenhard has examined the so-called oneuroid form of assets, a special form of a changed home to sleep.
Oneuroid states are highly complex, detailed fictivital dreams, which the concerned considers being rubbered and cannot be separated from the low condition.
Oneuroid status results in extreme trauma or illness caused, such as patients with polyradicular impairment that are consumed in the full area of motor protection.
When a man is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, maybe the persistent, full uncapable movement, he replaces life threatening reality by his own, imaginary world, which is offline from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Two of the station between sleep and hallucination.
Because in reality, it is not possible to enable the accommodation, the change of the world, but the reality of the presentation.
Intensity is the form of support for senses and transmission of senses in a very inaccessible manner, which allows us to have our own ability to form, to go through a moment to lose home.
Everything is real, and it's in the UK.
The history of the art Peter Cornelius ́usen also describes his uneuroid records in his book "Herzwechsel" (Hermen's heart) as a salvated action of soul.
It was 49 years after the cardiac cardiovascular operation with the next cardiac transplantation, he was released to his home in a few-day ways, while his body was inevitably lying on an intensity unit.
Seeing the world that created, visiting foreign times and places: It becomes an old man stuck on the liver, in the inflammation sanatorium, a robot watching his health.
He lives in a wounded middle-year between the throat that produces blood-free substances.
On the engine brings the Greek into his own authority, on the sick bowl surfs on the virgin in Alâch and matches the Korean mafian.
They're totally upset into the imaginary, it's all real, and it's in the ecstasy.
These internal roads are mainly different from any dream.
The dream is another condition, it describes his conclusion.
In contrast to dreams, the races of these mental roads are evidently evident after years and in inappropriate details.
Even more clear and more intensive than the benefit.
The intensity of this survival spreads the horizon of our other fair experiences, says the psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneuroid statuss, psychosis, hallucination and drugs are shown as the crochets are also in the wide state of our internal images of externality.
Every change in the status of the house, the psychologist Kasten, can lead to the deformation of what we call reality.
Truth, which may also be pleasant.
Snow can come
Burda
On May 27, to take children’s abilities
The new leadership Kallen is a transitional solution: Hubert Burd wants to deliver his business into his hands to both children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding has 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Guest Hubert Burd sees his business at the hand of their children.
Both children will be inherited in 27 years and have a strong income to the business, says the 69-year-old man to SPIEGEL.
We've been detailed to resolve it carefully.
A question is whether they are also active in the company, and then it is addressed.
And the question if he has the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees in the head of their children if they are not sufficiently able.
It would kill like kids, so business.
Burda reported on Thursday that from January he was downloaded from the presidential and called Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his representative.
52-year-old Kallen is a member of the representative in Burdy since 1999.
First he was in an old age.
In the case of Pokladna, the responsibility for the property of the company was added and after Jürgen Todenhaver was removed also the Direct marketing, Cizina, Tisk and Finance.
First, none of the members of the family remains in the head of the recruitment.
Burd's child is 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Callene's name also serves to it, and "They're about 10, 15 years," he reported Burd.
Holding should be a 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burd.
In view of the cases of Schickedanz and Shaeffler, Burd said that neither family businesses have any certainty before the business: "They have been touched by fires that have been allowed to defeat the desired spectacle that they have been speculated and thought they could be a big player.
That was never my strategy.
He never had a dream of the world power, says Burd.
I don't feel as a political preceptor of this country, as Sparinger, and I don't want to play a world-wide game with Time, these businesses are too big.

End and Barcelona, with electric mobile
The Energy Company ends together with the Barcelone Council founded 'Live Channel'.
It is a project for the development and mobilization of electricity in the main city of Catalan.
LIVE's Office (Electromotive Logistics) will set and will conduct the road plan for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensuring the mobility agreements, will create, coordinate and present the contributions, etc.
It will also develop projectMOVELE, promote electric mobile, collect views and results of activities in the involved sectors.
Totally taken, it is to support this transport rate of future.
3 'Electric Citys'
However, Barcelona is not the only town that is involved in the project of driving electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla are also connected to the project.
It is about three cities that have chosen a government in the MOVELE Plan to support the driving of electric cars.
The Energy Company ends has already signed with the Catalogue Government.
It is aimed at supporting research and development in the Catalogue autonomy.
This also includes energy-related activities and mainly energy efficiency.
It's not the only initiative with the ends' initiative regarding electrical mobility.
The community is involved in European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts the climate period in the car industry.
The President of the Government José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish car industry, the main export sector of the State, is waiting for "current periods".
In the economic report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero broadcasted measures introduced during the year to support the car sector.
"No competitive car industry plan would wait for us today to be left, to close some of our main productive companies," said the President of the Government.
"By this plan and the desire of individual marks to continue to act in Spain in this high competition sector, the future is added to certain periods of peace in this industrial, which is our main export sector."
In this sense, the competitive plan, which constitutes part of the Integral Car Sektor Plan (PIA), appointed 800 million for 19 producers projects and 137 supported fires which mobilized investments exceeding 3 billion Eur.
The President of the Government explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for modernization of production and processing.

Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining sports
Even so, it is pleasant to show that the attitude to the environment does not have any negative influence on sport.
And therefore, Mazda3 has a building system of stop and starting the engine - also baptized as-Stop, which is the device that is currently available only with the benzin engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is marked by good characteristics that have reached as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle execution, residence, behavior, mechanism, i-Stop...
All these aspects are exciting in Mazda3.
Previous seats inside the locations of drivers have exciting ergonomy and are very fixed.
Volant is also extraordinarily jealous.
Helping tools and consoles will conclude that Mazda continues in Japan's tendence in developing a future design with many buttons and buttons and a very red and blue color.
This is partly in our presentation of Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrast to the freshness of German products and specifically more with Volkswagen Golf, who all want to hurt.
As usually, this Japanese compact product represents more than sufficient space for four adults who want a very comfortable drive.
Moreover, it is necessary to mention a big commitment room and regular faces.
The automatic stop and starting system of the engine is now available only with a benzine engine for two litres and 150 horse forces with a six-stock hand-transmission.
This engine is a real laugh. It's very tired, it's marking a decreased level of sound, its performance, and the lower depreciation.
Although the most requested Mazda3 is in the distillation version, all who do not find so many kilometers per year should not blow this i-Stop with a benzine engine, because it is indicated as a more comfortable comfort when it is driven and reduced.
As regards the equipment, the version selected to test is called Sportive and includes more series of elements.
In the series of equipment, it is necessary to mention the primary system of monitoring of drivings (RVM), which prevents the survey of the dead angle, control and stability, control, internal light sensitive on the light, a palub computer with a large screen, a parking knife, a single climate, a sensor of rain and light, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and a round of 17-pillars.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, for approximately EUR 1.500: adaptable BOSE light and audio system with CD holder, other than parts.
Close
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most complex cars of its category.
It is particularly indicated as the quality of the materials used, its operation and its high level of equipment.
Moreover, people who do not find more than one miles per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a gas engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only income of this model is its highest price which makes 21.770 euros in the implementation of Luxury and 23.270 euros in the tested version -Sportive-.
In this high price, Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
Luxus 'Primeira'
L. A. has a red cover, cool like the hand of Penelope, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were split more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of 'Nine'. (Foto: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", extravagant as a habit, has chosen a dark lady.
FonPeek Slib
Peek is extremely limited, is only used to view mail, without the possibility of viewing a certain type of attachment or surfing on the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of glory in the United States when the Time magazine estimated her as one of the products of the year.
Seeing her outside is hard, but this idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
In the section of smartphones, Peek is highly low price and monthly payments, less than half amounts, such as iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started to offer two new equipment: one is designed exclusively for Twitter, another on the basis of the duration of free data service, but it is necessary to pay for Peek the sixth.
FonPeek, represented yesterday on Le Web action, is a European version of finding and equal to its third change.
It's limited as his American cluster, but it's a surprise.
The monthly price for maintenance takes approximately 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People who travel with smartphone already know what it means to come on the data service after transmission of the border or not long-term search for a WiFi café (with a connection to Fon) so that they can look at the mail.
The idea with rooming at a fixed price is incrediblely attractive and should have been identified for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special constructions and the way of plans, but for my experience, a person would need a doctor from the physics to understand them, and a very good brilliant to be able to read the miniature letter.
The European Commission continues to require to reduce roamingu tariffs so that they can be accessible for all Europe, which has not yet been covered.
There is a detailed concern for the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that such a device such as FonPeek (is interesting that it is still having the name of Fon if it does not have WiFi) will achieve this type of tariff, means that operators start thinking differently and consider different offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another beautiful example, offers book downloads and other searches on the Internet.
None of them, no complications.
This equipment is connected and is paid when buying, never after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the case ofFonPeek, it's the possibility of buying a permanent access like Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm watching the mail on the phone, thank you.
I'm waiting for it, because I think it's the best guy.
It would be interesting if the same system would be used on the computer.
The color that Michelle loves
The yellow is a favorite color of the United States first.
For Barack Obama's arrival to the president of the United States, she chose clothes and cabs in this color, she also chose the same color when she reached her at the second most important moment of his life: the transfer of Nobel's peace price in Osla.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it was a similar color - yellowed with severe effects -, in both cases it was a classic complete - clothing, cotton and cab of the same substance - a large height or lime.
The first view seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to go into the stages of the astery princess and wear similar clothes.
The file from which the clothing is prepared makes both models significantly different.
At the opportunity of the arrival to Michelle, she used a big country in Osla with pressure.
Changes and supplies: Green bottles with the medium-height subcutaneous, now-like model, but in gold colour.
It also carries different eyees: this cort-draw, before the hair is released.
75% of the working mothers have a work -- problems relating to maternity.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of younger women who want to arrange a child.
This is the result of the study 'Pleasure and work' of the Spanish Women' career conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the woman's Institute.
9.737 women were involved in 15 to 75 years of age and the results are unique: 75% of the working mothers have the opportunities for the workmarket from the mother.
It emphasizes that at the beginning of the partnership, there are many differences in the views of children in order to work or not, as well as in the type of employment.
Women who don't work outside the house, work on a shared relationship or do not have stable jobs, start living with their partner before, earlier born the first child and generally have more children.
On the other hand, women with stabil employment, especially in the public sector, partnership and maternity, and have less fruits.
"The women from 35 to 49 years have the first child's stability in the average of 3,7 years from the beginning of partnership. This number is 4.1 in the case of women, which renewed their stability employment the largest part of their life and thus had to deal with partnership and children's income.
The type of call also has a strong influence on maternity, even though the decrease of the start of the relationship with a partner," explains Margarita Delgado, which is a research in CSIC.
Another factor that affects women in the time of closing the maritality of the disorder is a degree of education.
The research shows that the higher level of education is even higher when the woman is born and has his first child.
The differences between women are also the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 years of a group of women who were born by the basic and higher education, their first child was born in 25.1 p. 32. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"There is another division between women depending on their education.
Women with the basic education are given and born the first child before they find stable employment, while women with central or high education are in the opposite of the privilege of getting a stability employment, before closing marriage and the birth of the first child," Delgado states.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris just added a new name to its pressing list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German heritage has become the face of different products of this tag under the universal password 'Why I am standing for it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most unelegant heric international levels, is added to another slave personL'Oreal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fund, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope.
Before it, the Evangeline Lilly's elected club ('Proliferation') and Freida Pinto ('Millionary from Chatrche').
The Spanish part of this cosmetic mark is also included by significant characteristics:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelinin partner in 'Followed').
British Mode prices
British owners have a lot of things to talk about mode.
Their most significant representatives - agencies and models, early and now - have met on the annual transmission of prices that have been achieved in London, on Royal Court os Justice.
Nobody missed the meeting.

Poker Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicent provides in 'Esov poker' (Alfaguara, the illustration of Fernando Vicent) for thirty rentgen pictures of writers with whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases and in the current life).
It doesn’t do so in fearful and predictable gears (biographic similarity, life, and work), but it looks for something similar to the creational personality.
The road brings a surprise, and Vicent doesn't shoot gates or inspiration.
This book is a wonderful lessons, even when reading.
I'll put some looks in here.
About Albert Camus: "In the pages of this book, I have made sure that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but the spirit of impulse, almost physically, the same as what I feel, but it can't be called: the benefit of anti-excuse, the morality without sin and the innocentness without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allergic Christian, wrote for his own nature and never intellectual, something between the infirmity and the inconscience, with a improved poetical humor, without meaning, as if it were the bowl of the node that almost killed her."
About Graham Green: "Our man was assigned to this woman for a period of thirty years, citizenship, distress, and exciting, which is the spirit and the privilege of reaching the heavens by the way of loss."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssea issued in Paris in 1922, Sylvia Beach. It's one of the eighty tops of the Universal Literature, which is needed to convince the north side of which you often see the best horolezation."
About William Faulkner, "It was a strange man.
He said about himself that he was a boyfriend of a boyfriend, else the son of a black crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer took this man from Mnich on the pool to take his call until the night of the 20th century in his literary image, running himself before himself and calling to the future and swinging to the Churchs."

About Pio Barrow, "What else did Martína Santos do than to move Joyce on Barrow?
What else happened to Benet than to let Barrow fix the Faulkner weapons?
What is the matter with the purpose of the Lord, except to make the praise of the man's glory?"
Baby aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother passed our quarter, in Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people in 15 to 18 years passed by the tribe and our dog, the cross that was saved from the weight of a weight of a maximum of six kilograms, without one word, they bought it two times and hurt him hardly.
Our injury is more likely to see nothing funny in such an aggression against a small and independent animal, which was also on the leadership.
And that choke of old lady after this incident, when she looked at the prosecutor with those individuals, she began to be afraid of her own security, because such a devil, a devil who attacks the animal, is able to do the same thing to the woman, the child, the old man or anyone who is weaker than he himself.
It happened in five hours ago afternoon, in the morning, in the surface of a calm quarter.
The peascock was crying all day.
Of course, we have made a complaint to the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that it was to something, and we haven't called a challenging question, we notice that these white killers were a Spanish nation.
The destruction has made us, and they have announced this.
We don't understand what's happening with the young today when it's distressing the suffering of an undefend animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where the right education has been shared, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helm use
The manufacturer of Mr Michelin in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Support (Fesvial) started a campaign for the support of helm use, especially for younger motorists, as both of these entities today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of the use of the helmy, because it is the only hedge that can be prevented by prevention and death in the case of accidents in motorcycle drive.
Michelin's company notes that this campaign is a part of their transport security obligations, which "signs more than to make and produce more safe products," and confirmed that it is trying to comply with this campaign as well as otherwise in the form of an instructive and information campaign.
This new campaign for supporting the use of helma in motorcycle, under the password 'This be or not to be', is the first stage when more than 500 fair motorcycles will be identified for the most large public.
Finally, the company Michelin warned that the transport security is a "continuous problem" of this company, which is a producer of pneu’s dual vehicles and its main goal is a continuous increase in the safety of the products.
Increases the sale of light use vehicles
At least two years ago, the market of light use vehicles is beginning to remember.
All 9.425 vehicles issued in November in Spain included an increase of 12.6% in comparison with 2008 and more, the first increase in 22 months of a permanent accident, according to the numeric data of the Anfac producers' pattern organisation and the sellers of Ganvam.
However, the primary data is better to give to the karantenia, since November 2008 is a significant bad period of comparison and was 60% reduction in comparison with the previous year.
The result is that, despite access in the last month, the total number of vehicles notified in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous year.
From January, 95.853 vehicles were sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light use vehicles: derivatives of personal cars, pick ups, supplies, less cost cars and light cars/country.
And no clouds that are most damaged of the request, even though they have bought private persons, the majority of the purchases have performed smaller and medium-sized companies, and in 100% cases, the financing of third-country persons.
For restriction from the closing of bank credit resources, additional factors such as the stop of activity or the continuation of a bad economic activity should be added.
In particular, in the case of personal vehicles, the 2000E purchase support has not been too helped.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the oxygens of animals undertaken by small and medium-sized companies who want to buy a easy use vehicle to 3.5 tonnes with CO2 level not exceeding 160 grams per km, but the number of operations was confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam, they recalled that it was necessary to give special attention to the management of these vehicles and also for industrial vehicles (camons and buses).
The seller's association provides that the development will be similar to loni in 2010 and in the calculation of sales in private vehicles and 4x4 will be decreased by 19%.
The help system in the hands of the bottle is already binding.
Similarly, as in the case of the ABS anti-blocking system, it will be with the management of the ESP stability, the hand-bearing systems, all of this will happen to the obligation of European vehicles.
In the event, it is already a part of the compulsory equipment of all newly evaluated personal vehicles and easy use vehicles, while the remaining is fixed for the elimination of the failure, which is February 2011.
The EU's care aims to enhance the protection of travelers, and it works so that it can help to prevent many weapons.
The help system of hand-shore increases the pressure on the bottle in the nutrient case, which will prove after the driver is compressed.
But he can't keep this pressure until the end.
According to the study that was conducted by the manufacturer of car parts of Bosch, the third of the drivers who have an accident did not lay down the wind before the swimming and the half of them did not use the full force of the grid.
By 1.100 accidents
Instead, this aid requires a maximum of the driving system, decreases the low distance of the vehicle.
According to the studies carried out in the EU solely if all vehicles were equipped by this type of equipment, it could be restricted to 1 100 death accidents annually related to the carrier.
The reduction of this number will be more significant and more significant for the calculations would be prohibited by one of the four accidents with an impact on the person-after the introduction of such intelligent systems of handflow.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (a helping radar or camera) takes overcome and reports the drivers, other than a easy driving.
The driver's response, he'll help him to increase the pressure on the pedal if it's necessary.
The driver does not react, even if the swimming cannot be prohibited, the equipment affects more insignificantly on the floor and reduces the risk of damage to minimum.
General Motors has a plan for Opel to ice
Nick Reilly, the new president of the company General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of a new Meriva will be started in the first week of April - probably on 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the American manufacturer warns that to fulfil the renewal plan for Opel will need more time.
Nick Reilly, the new president of the GM Europe firm, is trying to make each point of the plan first agree with the side concerned.
In this context, the final document, which will be submitted first to the employees and then to the Governments of individual countries in which the production campaigns are located, will be issued at the latest beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM ensures that Saab sales decisions should be taken in these days.
It is not wonderful that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to take some decisions first.
The GM community allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to get Volvo, but considers the possibility of the Netherlands Sports producer of Skyper, who acts under the protection of the Russian Group of Converg.
If it is possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some active Saab of the Chinese company to Baic.
It continues to decide to close at the end of the year of Saab if it is not able to sell.
Language with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this splendid model, Boxster S used as a base, and they were able to reduce the weight of 80 kg, so weight shows only 75 kg.
On the basis of the first line, the automatic downloading station was in a payable performance with hand control, with which the weight was decreased by 21 kg; thereafter the carbon doors were used like GT3, which means other 15 kg less; the elimination of the climate, 13; the reduction of the fuel level from 64 to 54 litres has also contributed to the reduction of the weight of other 7 kg; after the installation of other sports seats of 12 kg, the depths of 19 palm rounds five kilos.
And finally, the removement of the audio CDR-30 means more than six kilograms and the replacement of door records with textile records means another kilogram.
It was also offered with a bicycle transmission PDK, one vehicle was tested with a six-six-depth box manually, mainly on the streets of the second class in California, in the mountain ranges with many splits.
His behaviour can only be characterized as an inaccessible.
Decreasing weight does not mean that the vehicle to asfalt is not printed.
Moreover, we have not already placed such a small and easy model that would, at the same time, transfer such security on the movement in the trail, even in the highest levels.
It's a small athlete able to cover the weapons at a short driving after the needed time, until we're ordering him sprint, fucking, and re-using the engine...
Anything we're going to want, it's what the car's going to do.
And he's doing it with the chirurgical accuracy.
Engine sound according to the will
Sound V6 boxer, with 320 horses (on 10 more than Boxster S) is a very wound and it is possible to strengthen the option 'sport' and the rational system that modifys the engine sound that was already used in Panamery.
Capacity of acceleration is brutal, either when seating or recovery.
The bands are strong, but not strong or incompatible.
Asfalt roads we're walking with Boxster Spyder was quite deceived, but the car was well acquired of the requests.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the driving, and in some cases, we have made a light on the morning and the swimming even on the next afternoon.
Definitely this ultra-easy vehicle is one of the most interesting cars on the market, because it's something more than just the Boxster S change.
The car will be sold in February 2010 for the price of 70.831 euro.
'Small Small'
Friend Carla Lagerfeld, the Coco Cocoon row icon and the possibility of "starlette" on the 'firmy' views, the song leads his face to bad girls as great as your Chanel cabs.

Basconia has made a victory in Israel
Work; postnaissed a brilliant victory in 82-91 at its accommodation on the complicated Maccabi Electra cross, despite reading absents in Duska Ivanoa's company, so she reached the head of her group after the great exhibition of Mirzy Teleto, which with eight three points was the best statement in the company (29 evaluation).
Vitorie has been able to replace a significant independence Herrmanna, Olesona, Huertase or Mic's large dose of saturation and collective work, although it has to suffer until the end to gain victory.
Furthermore, the large accuracy of the circuit with 16 three points has shared much in the final triumph.
The cup started with the head of the blue that set up on the mark since the beginning.
The first four boxes for Vitorius were from the distance, already indicated that they attacked the Israeli society very strongly.
English and Teletovic looked between the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alamic Society decided for the inner game Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, who was accepted by songs and springs when returning to his pizza work to increase the benefit before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to show as the best in his company with 13 points, although it's not six', when Splittera's evaluation already indicated that it was the best night for Brazil.
But despite the depth was steadfast until the break, it was not decided in the least and the Arabians wanted to remember Vitorium that everyone won't win on their cross, and 'Eliase' had been able to win.
Eidson and Pnini were determined to contribute to the "julty" to the calculation (50-49).
More Inadequate
The members of Ivanovic, hurt, but not dead, needed a few precise hers to breathe, and then appeared Mirza Teletovic, which three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-thirds, and with English and Ribase returned the skin to the calm-count (54-67), which reached local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alabasts put their skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they do not allow anyone to prepare them for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their husbandhood, did not depart and tried to keep the company in life from three points (70-77).
Even though the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the bathroom had already been winning aTel A日 for the first time.
Poisons disable the Union to fight
The University was expressly spent in Greece with Olympiacos and left him the leading of the group B in Eurolize in a repository, which was signed by three attacks from Unica, but mainly the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.

Brazil determined Zelay's delay date
The Brazilian Government set the time of the arrest of Manuel Zelayi on its excellence in Tegucigalp.
The meeting president must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010, when its mandate is officially finished.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d'affaires of Brazilian veloslanicity in Hungary's main city, confirmed for the Globo TV that "Mel" knows that it must go out of the ambassade from September 21.
"It's true that on 27 January after the end of his mandate he must go and look for another attack."
The station also felt a former Stater, who confirmed his intention to leave the prominence before the specified time: "I'm going to go first, logic under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelay's telephone stated.
After the elections of November 29 (when he was chosen by Porfirio Lobo) Zelaya assured that he remained in Brazil's magazine until January.
However, the same week he tried to get a campaign in Brazil.
Finally, the operation was distorted because Zelay refused the political asylum undermining that he tried to store the government of "de facto", which President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and wheat from the past yar, when the inflation of actives represented the overseer on the markets, the incidence on the markets was revealed, which should not be surprised because it is already a natural condition in the area where the operators take decisions on the future that are uncertain themselves.
The medication used by central banks to stabilise the market was the debt of the direct purchase of assets and the immediate release of liquidity in the nearly 0 course so that financial institutions could purchase assets to decline.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have already been completed, and without doubting their non-international liquidity policy, they are starting to take a little fish into the school, as the Spanish Central Bank has affected its employment in the nearest year.
The investors therefore doubt the ability of the world's economy to maintain economic renewals without such a heterodoxal measures and to return risk reduction.
The movement of the bowls and the differences of the long-term re-speeds have obtained points, although they are still very remotely unusual levels reached at the beginning of the year.
States were required to socialize the private risk, which again touched public debt.
Repeat on the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have become an attachment to the selected investment, which extended the difference of the euro country against Germany.
Spain was not at the same time imposed, but at that time the Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduction of the Spanish Kingdom.
On the other hand, a certain failure is not useful for the deterioration of residents of the moral risk that have tried to reassure the knowledge of persons responsible for the world's economic policy because of deteriorating deficiencies to employment, if a new day of appreciation should be reported.
However, Dubai represents a tribe fight between emiries for the renewal of power in emirates, and about Greece, we have already seen it before.
The government covers deficit, elections and new governments.
The sales made it in Italy after Berlusconim and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It does not mean that Ecofin will save Hungary from failing to comply with the payments for the beginning of the year and to enable the euro Member State not to comply with its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin provides the Greek government for transparency and commitment of its own citizens to the common responsibility in the need for exceptional measures to reduce its public funds' stability.
If, as we expect, we are before the normalization of the premium of transitional risks, some of the positions in supported positions would have been expected.
In Spanish case, while our differences in the public debt will increase as the debts of European companies, we do not need to be concerned.
The European differences are decreasing and ours will continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's matter is only an anecdote. When our primary indicators require the ability of study services to take their renewal scenarios and revise their approach scenario for 2011, including OCDE and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not know greatly for the Spanish economy to achieve this warning.
It looks like it would be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the time "attentionally, friends of drivers".
Relative sectors
President Iberdrol Ignacio Sanchez Galán was the first intervention in the last two decades before the subcommittee of the sentence, where the Energy Strategy of Spain has been negotiated in these days.
After his intervention followed by the president Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galán presented a number of comments on the question that he submitted to the subcommissions to the closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola Spain Âe, 50,000 million euros to 2020 and 60,000 million from this date to 2030, if nuclear powers are currently in the operation.
This would happen, the need for investment will be 60,000 million and up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments must be moved to increase production capacity, not to distribute networks and international connections
The question has changed since 2020 and will need to increase the performance.
Its offer is focused on gases and corners with carbon oxide capturing mechanisms, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, it is considered that new 18,000 MW needs, but with other "supported energy".
Galan, who believes that the law of a sustainable economy, which has just approved the government, corresponds to the line that the undertaking requested, did not want to lay down the vineyard as a royal decree for supporting the national carbon control, which resists the political fight against climate changes.
According to his opinion, it is "lawful" in this sense, despite the "great" measures, as President Iberdrol called.
Whatever it is, Galan believes that the investment decisions, although it does, must be taken now because their consideration remains and is needed to be a stability taxation for their start.

The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatization, but the difficulty of income is with herself in other ways than the acquisition of local building firms.
It is still an example of Spanish gigant in the sector, other than the Asian references.
S received a position on the market by 30% of its share in Hochtief, the owner of the cited company Leighton.
Million assets
The acion is focused on the geographical and largest expertise for the sector, where it already has a significant presence by its energy supplier's activities and in the sale trade.

New car evaluation tools
In these days, he's breathing and injury, not only autoservices.
Every day there are thousands of cars that have suffered an accurate event, revoked to the service where the employer must consider damage and costs.
No aware event is the same and the calculation of the costs for work and time of the work of force can be a long and consistent work.
Calculate manually the costs for the expenditure from 200,000 to 30,000 euros in terms of shares and the work of force can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a question of a minute
Therefore, almost 100% of the experts are using this type of system.
The suppliers of services and solutions for assessment of accurate tasks and maintenance shall provide a collection of information provided by the manufacturers to prepare and offer a useful tool to their clients.
In Spain Audatex, of the US Soler group is a leader company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.

Working with data provided by manufacturers is not simply.
According to Eduard Velazquez, business director Audatex, works in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provides information in a different form.
In addition, the quantity of data for processing continues to grow, since in the last five years more versions, variants and engine solutions have been mentioned than in the past 15 years.
When the new vehicle comes into the market, these businesses will start working.
It's about a very hot job because it's necessary to catalogue each of the thousands of the vehicle and fix his price.
Furthermore, each model is carried out "intelligent" graphical processing, where it is possible to "speak" separate parts of tourist vehicles.
This is a model with massive sale, work can be ready for a week if the process is very ≥.
It is about a minority car that may take three or four months. In the present Audatex has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models that have information, it belongs to Porsche, but not to Ferrari or Lamborghini.
About the rail park are over 99%.
For the work of documentation and processing of databases, Audatex has eight centers divided worldwide (Spania, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them is specialized for specific marks.
The National Seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
More than hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) are working together with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the processing of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data and clients are available to update each two days.
The processing of this insufficiency of information allows companies to use and provide different products.
The most often use is focused on the performance and maintenance, but, according to individual countries, there are tools for the management of replacement shares or for the calculation of the sales or residual values of the car.
The only undertaking available to the cover which informs the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is not offering in our country, but in the United States yes.
With the reporter of products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain aid to be used by professionals in the sector.
This undertaking offers ten different tools, including the star product AudaPlus, a standard solution to the assessment of the accurate events designed for the scientist.
It includes cars, motorcycles and easy and hard industrial vehicles.
Furthermore, it includes time for the expenditure estimated by the manufacturer or the lac.
This tool shall be applied in accordance with the use of each evaluation.
The highest price is 5,75 euros for clients who use it a little, maximally ten times a month.
Then every guarantee that carries out thousands of estimates is acquiring its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN enables the full identification of the vehicle and the equipment out of the mount line only on the basis of the first number of subway.
AudaGlass is focused on the vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service for the professional sector on the Internet, which allows you to arrange vehicles with a total security task.
His statistical service is very useful to identify trends, to perform geodemographic analysis or to detect declines according to labels or models.
For example, it is possible to study the number of modeling marks passed from the havary service or the number of serious accurate events in certain periods.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish undertaking to develop this type of tools.
On the other hand, Gt Estimate sells, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to shares or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is the company of Einsa group based in 1971 as a service supplier and solution to assessing damage, hair or car maintenance
Gt Guia Assessment is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 in services, 3,100 scientists and 53 insurance.
The volume of turnover increased by 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 EUR 10,8 million.
At the beginning of the latest year, the internationalization process began to be installed in Paris.
Audatex appeared in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 was established in Spain.
According to the resources of the company, 62% of her brother appear in Europe and 38% in North and South America, which works with 900 insurance and 33,000 services, from which 3,000 in Spain.

Internet carrying havary vehicles
Loni in October of the Solera group bought Autoonline, the Internet base for sales of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles for the accommodation of events.
The operation proposed a recording of 59.5 million euros from 85% of the company that could extend to 15% in the next year.
The purpose of the purchase was to provide more services with the added value to the applicants with the possibility of access to a major international market.
This service of evaluation and purchase and sales is handed outside to professionals in the sector, such as insurance, scientists, payments, services, sales of replacement shares and professional sellers who must be registered before the start of the operation.
This platform appeared in 1996 in Germany and managed more than 650,000 operations in Europe, from which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey are held between the main markets.
Web has currently more than 1.500 registered sellers and 4.000 experts.
It manages 3.000 daily inserates and is added to approximately 100 new inserates each day on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish wage, the number of the transport numbers was registered cannot be returned to the operation, but it may be used as a source of replacement parts that have not been damaged.
History-value vehicles may have an authorised operation, although they were arranged, after the preliminary procedure.
Start service in four times
With the Auda-Taller company Audatex, Audatex provides that the budget will only be received in four steps: the identification of the vehicle, the search of the replacement work, the creation of the budgetary agency budget.
The facility of use is a fundamental submin for these systems, especially for the convincement of professionals in a higher or less measure, which are sustainable in the use of new management technology.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles, from which the tourists are 666, 109 terens, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 trucks.
Naturally, the computer is required to connect to the Internet.
After the identification of the model to be made using the numbers of the submission, the actual graphical display of the model shall be displayed and then the necessary replacement part shall be selected.
The user may include variables as the price of the work of force, adjunction or slopes, and then print and deliver to the applicant.
AudaTaller is not a tool to evaluate as AudaPlus, but more than a reference directory.
The division between both systems is that it is oriented to the service and does not include the evaluation of the work of force.
The costs for the use of this long-term instrument are EUR 350 per year, which the applicant can finance.
The Audatex firm currently works on this view to be three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that the mechanisms welcome because it allows for example to choose the door and to turn them into the internal side.
