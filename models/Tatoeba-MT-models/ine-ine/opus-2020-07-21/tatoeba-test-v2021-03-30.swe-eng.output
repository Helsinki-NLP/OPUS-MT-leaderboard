Welcome!
It wasn't fantastic.
It's easy to catch, easy the past.
Did everyone find their faults?
Where does your grandma live?
The house was quiet.
I let my feelings deceive my judgment.
Tom took Mary's hand.
People's sitting on the grass.

Tom sneaked down.
It's okay.
I'm responsible for his behavior.
Tom's afraid.
I got a reading disk in the Century.
She's playing hokey in weeks.
You're not talking much.
The red paraply reminded her of her grandmother.
I remember the first time.
This is a very timely task.
Tom took out his ornaments and went into the dust.
The other kids call her Nasse.
That meaned much for me.
I'm not good to dance.
I told Tom to take it quietly.
I'm a man now.
Tom teaches.
She has taken too much work.
She's alone.
Give Tom a handsheet.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered what Mary said was true.
We never agree.
We'll be surprised if the letter has ever come out or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You think you're in bed all day, right?
That's what Tom can't do.
Blank crying under the box.
I didn't even know what she named.
Do you really want to do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows that it's true.
She wept.

Talk to me what's the problem.
Tom put Mary down.
You should like it.
I have some more.
I'm using the computer.
Sex was inside, the boy included.
Kate's crazy.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan actually?
Tom seems to be exhausted.
He's not angry.
There's no doubt who's chosen.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's funny.
Did you read Sagan about the ring trilogin?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not a easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She predicted the same kindness.
What are you looking at?
The young man's dead.
Stop talking to me.
Good luck, Gilly Brother.

Tom hurt me.
Tom's helping.
One morning he saw a sweet girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the socket.
Let me look.
Tom wants our help.
The time is out.
My dad's healthy.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have money, you'll get it out without.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
The whole word immediately filled me with a new power.
Put the tower on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need something?
I want a few hands.
That was exactly what I needed.
I'm coming from Brazil.
I'm late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
What did you talk to?
The boy took the cat's shot.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of myself.
I'm unemployment.
This medicine's going to buy your diarrhoea.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom a bit between four eyes.
He'll fall for the temptation.
The team doesn't work.
I can explain it.
She feels like a kid.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she's got super powers.
I can do this all.
Everyone needs to know.
After stopped, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to keep with, but you can at least accept that there are people who have other ideas than you?
Tom dropped the book down.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school for 10 minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't think to meet him again.
Even during the worktime, I'll pay for my Internet dependence.
I never thought it would be so hard to create a iPad application.
You haven't been away for a long time.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I don't try to get down to the town.
I mean, it wasn't sorrow.
Can you refrigerate it?
Tom bleeded with the light.
You hurt me?
Tom's worried.
I liked to come here.
This isn't a fish.
Tom and Mary may not have done that everyone said they did.
There's no one here who calls that.
It's time to go.
All three men lie.
Come and sit down.
It's gotta go.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My engine's crazy.
You think she's nice, huh?
He lived a single life.
This will take years.
I felt wrong with the word.
