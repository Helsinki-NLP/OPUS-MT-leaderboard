Barack Obama receives the peace-nobel price as the fourth US President
The President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norwegian, for 26 hours, to meet the peace-nobel price here as the fourth US President in the history.
Moreover, he receives the diploma and the medaille and a shock over 1,4 million.* for his exceptional efforts to intensify the world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The chief of the White House comes tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Norwegian Metropole and will be busy all the time.
In the case of the Nobel Institute, it is a newspaper, where he first contacts the five members of the committee who chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The President couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and the Queen Sonja.
In the midnight, the ecclock reaches its height point with the ceremonie, at Obama's prestige price.
He receives this as the fourth US President, but only the one who receives the price directly in the office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when the price is taken.
The President does not want to disclose this topic because he knows that he is taking the price as a president, which leads to war in two countries at the time.
He has strengthened the war efforts by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which does not give up any of his critics.
At the ceremonie, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the shack over → million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech Crowns).
The money he intends to make s≤ more active but he has not yet decided on a specific career work.
The event programme then provides a bankett with the President and his wife, where there will be an accessory to the Prime Minister of Norway and other 250 guests charged.
Obama was very retained from the beginning of the price.
For example, he showed that he felt that he did not deserve the price.
He also repeatedly repeated that it is not only the price for him, but for all who strive to the same values as he.
Immediately after the notification, he concluded that this is "request for action".
Nature is accused of pressure
The leadership policies accused the Presidents of the Citizens' Association of Natural Protection Communities for pressure.
In several cases, in the last year, he introduced vocations against some building procedures, for the removal of his vocations, he requested money from the investors to his benefits, said the leadership police speaker, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz Natural Protection Community Lubo ́ Studicka.
Now he's in prison and it brings him a prison penalty from up to three years.
The sort-M-container in Brenn doesn't sound good
In Prague, people can sort the drinking packages, in the South Sea areas, you will find the sort-M-container again on the step and tritt.
And in Brünn?
There you need to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable tons of MIT.
I don't want to say that the waste trend would not work at Brenn.
But I think that, although the Council rulers do not care enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brenn is located in the waste trends in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always able to remove only paper, glass and plastic materials, but especially through the number of tonnes for such waste.
Have they ever tried to cut the PET flags in a sample cover?
This is the same art, especially time and strong nerves.
The only place that I have found until now is the marine place towards the covered.
Mr Underka should not be worried by his colleagues, but this is too little to me.
Notwithstanding that the waste trend is also no milk in other parts.
The whole range of my friends wouldn't sort the waste.
From failure.
It's too far to them to the tonnes.
I don't wonder.
I've offered myself after the feast to remove a few glass and plastic flashes.
But on the Konicova Street, I haven't seen any color tons in view.
Fortunately, when I traveled to the right place, I came to the right place.
But the M' was almost over.
This is still the center of Brenn, which will be represented by the whole city, right?
However, ecology and any sort of isthetics are probably cold to the burning socialists.
They like to buy the city a eishockeyliga that makes us shame in the whole Republic instead of buying a few more tons of Mâme and offering the sorting of other rubber substances for a cleaner burn.
I'm glad that I could also visit my adoption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the EKO-COM Society, Brünn is actually the worst part of the southern region.
The "Paroubek" Budget has made the money for pensions and hospitals
After the Left Party has given more money to the farmers and employees despite the view of the Government, there is no more money for pensions, hospitals and building partners in the budget.
But not for the State obligations or for the International Court of Justice.
This causes more problems that will be in the second half of the next year, says the Minister for Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists have implemented the increase of maintenance for some groups, they have considered that the Government will have the money for the receiving expenditures, age rates or hospital payment. "This is just a delay of the problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
The credits are always paid by costs, and sometimes the money must be recovered.
Too much to choose where to take, the State case is empty.
If the social service or costs for the State management are not reduced, the tax shall be increased.
For all whose left party has now given more money: the firewall, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
For the pensions or hospital payments from which 1,8 billion have been missed, people must not have the most ability to get this money.
But for the price that the State is more debting - in the next year, not only 163 billion will be found in the State Case, but far more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, the debt will grow so quickly and also the costs and rates.
The State will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be allowed to increase the additional tax only or to reduce the maternity payment as the Government made in its area.
As a result of the cash waste for some electoral groups, five billion will also be found in the next year for the development of car and railways.
It is a majority of the sections in competition that can't be designed and maybe agreed.
At least get what is not costless.
This means treating or setting of thirty large building works, which also includes the European Gild creation, warns the speaker of the Ministerial Ministry, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it takes the salomonic l · it accepts the CEZ shareholders in which the State is owner of the responsibility, and then the money will be ejected into the Funds.
The problem is that the height of the dividends is never safe and it is no longer an infinite source.
In the previous year, CEZ was 18 billion in the budget.
Annually, the shareholders pay the environmental liquid, the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget in accordance with EU rules on the niveau of 5.7 ProP.
But this is not the end of the carneval of the conversions yet.
At least three billion dollars, the budget for various representations for the victims of the communism and of criminals or for applications for the courts, even for building.
If the State is accepted without this money, it is not safe.
This is a clean game of happiness.
If we lose a international court fight, we have to pay this too, Janota will clearly make it clear.
The Minister must then adjust the money within the resort or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserves.
Hundred millions were also missing for the already started "State Cass" project that would allow on-line monitoring on which the individual participants deployed the money.
The first step starts in January.
If the Minister does not find the money anywhere else, the project should be arrested and in this case there are sanctions, Janota warned.
Your next artphone will control two operating systems
The Americans consider the future with a phone on which the user can switch by pressing a single key between different operating systems.
The proposed plans seem very promised.
It's enough to just press one key, and from Windows Mobile will be in a few seconds in the Android switch.
Just this option wants to imagine the VMware company, which is especially possible to develop the computer software.
We allow you to execute two user profiles simultaneously on the phone.
You can switch between this, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, described by Srinivas Krishnamurti from the VMware company at the interview of the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November of the last year and submitted for the first time a few days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
The virtualisation of the type phones is not a fiction.
VMware already conducted the journalists the artphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a moderate Nokia N800 with a RAM speech of 128 MB, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were running parallelly.
The development of the new mobile technology for mobile phones is in full way.
The VMware firm is now together with the VMware operators in the virtualisation of artphones and the customer will come the devices within 2012.
Snow lack on the mountains quält the hotel owner
Scneeleose pistes do not only care for the Riesengeberg people.
The falling snow also disturbs people from the order of ski-retentions in hotels and pensions.
That is why you can still get free rooms in riesengeberg for all wintertermines, including Wednesdays and Silvesters.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but in the middle of them, they have to order connectively.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether our opinion will be on snow or on match, the operator of the Information Portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants the silvester residence in the spinner mixture exactly according to his imaginations should not wear the order anymore.
Whoever prefers the spending and comes to the quality of the stay at the second place, he can try to wait for a few days.
In addition to the silver day, the spinners of hotel owners offer more than week-end stays.
I think they're going to try for a long time to overcome these, but then they have to take care of them, and they're going in shorter times.
And then the free rooms will swim quickly, appreciate Jandura.
Free beds at all winter terms offer always the Ingtours travel office in Vrchlabi.
Now we are interested in most of the Wednesday Week, which has not yet been exhausted.
In our boat, sometimes the help of the places is still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared a few more precious holiday stays for the last time, and the Director of the Road Office Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, led to.
The silver day in Riesengeberg can also offer the Vrchlabi travel office, but there are less free places here.
The good paragraph also finds the first four days in February, the remaining winter terms are averagely crossed.
In this year, the interest of the winter residence is also negatively affected by the fact that there is no snow in the Riesenberg.
People wait if snow falls.
No one wants to bring the year-end to the mountains without snow.
If the pieces are cut off within a week, the night will also be exhausted, my shifter.
Environment and something better than last year, it seems to have the room in the hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We lie about five Pro's better than in the previous year.
On silver day and at Wednesday, we have just a few more free rooms.
There is great interest in the Poland vacations in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
To 80 Pro€ for silver retainment, the hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central park site in Janske Lazne.
Nevertheless, the latest hotel in Janske Lazne remains free of the help of beds.
We have been surprised in this year of January, for which we have already been occupied at the time of approximately 60 Pro.
A little weaker is between February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest is also increased in the stays in the Riesenberg, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, was held.
On a greater snow protection, the riesengeberg hotel owners waited between.
On Thursday, it should be cold and if it comes to a neighborhood, it should be on the mountains of snow.
But afterwards, Jiri Jakubsky informed the location of the Czech Weather office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is a mother of wisdom
It is almost curious that Barack Obama, the president with the call of the clergy, repeat his prosecutor in Afghanistan's question, which he himself believed for the most deep.
When he exposed his mentally expected Afghanistan's doctor, it was shown that he described these on the copy paper from the Busch Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only that he used in the text itself several times the term "like in Iraq", he even used the name of the Bush Reklame of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Previous Way" without losing.
He himself has criticized the Bush Idee - fresh troop quotas in the Iraq of the civil war - as "unresponsibility and in their follow-ups of the karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the only possible and in particular very much in the news about Iraq was not yet speaking in the news of Iraq.
The call Bushs was not disappointed by this, because it was objectively left the followers a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
In order to recover the county, the soldier asked him again, especially the general of Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the subordinational habits, criticized the deteriorating squees in the White House.
He requested 40,000 soldiers to make the situation better.
The Chairman has lost three months, but he has not come to a better idea, and so he has seen the general about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he pressed the adjunction for more 5.000, even if he originally calculated at least 100,000.
The most difficult problem with the entire Obama strategy is to remove the groups from Afghanistan in 18 months and to close this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-up will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the war of the last years, the Iraqian community is relatively well structured, their leaders honour the values.
The Afghanistan situation is endeavored by the counter-indexation - no one can leave and no agreements will be held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghanistan security forces used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even though they have been formally found correctly, remain only scene buildings behind which the patriarchal tribe relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interest between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the consistency of the situations that continue to complicate Pakistan and Iran influences.
In addition, the building of a "tradeable state", which is the minimalistic goal of the whole operation, is very unrealistic.
Time Horizont of Obama Strategy Frequent by His Voluntary
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only continued and is now at the border of the explosion.
That is what they believe that the small soldiers who have been broke in the war's cry about the "Fröhheim" creating a miracle here can only create a real romantic soul that doesn't allow to be impressed by facts.
From the political view, the date set for the staff is pure, because the Taliban will take it as the indirekte income of the disappearance of the Canaan.
The latest NATO pipe showed that the preparation of the Europeans to share in the battles in Afghanistan is too close.
Europe can be more able and does not want their electors to determine how the safety of Germany or Italy is associated with the war in the Hinduish village.
Another possibility of influence in the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to be weak and the strengthened sanctions on the Iranians, the United States will have a very serious question of whether the problem is not to solve with troops.
This question must be answered during the period in which America will run to Obama to the winners from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic spread of the Afghanistan situation.
The only comfortable plane for Barack Obama is the fact that there remains three years until the president's election, and thus remains a long time enough to take it into another position, if it would be a total disaster.
The Manager of the Goldman Sachs doesn't receive any premium boni anymore in bar
The leading forces of the Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs have no premium boni in bar for this year.
This has announced the company that thus reacts to the criticism of their loan practices.
A group of 30 staff managers receives instead of money action, but only in five years.
Furthermore, the action may be made to the managers if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Agency Re日s, is set up to the top of the efforts to connect the Premieboni der Wall Street with longer performance.
I think the Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction where it was to go, the former banker of the JPMorgan company, Douglas Elliott, led to.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of the criticism, after it had taken nearly 17 billion for the first three quarters of this year.
The total height of the premium boni during this year will probably exceed 20 billion agencies, even despite the current action shown today.
The high Prince Boni in the banking sector has become the worst political subject at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
The United Kingdom reported at the middle-week that it was intended to charge the banking boni who exceeded 25,000 pounds with a tax of 50 pro.
Similar steps are also prepared by France.
In this year, women have won the nobel prices in all experts, except in physical.
Five recorded women today have taken in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf takes the annual Nobel prices in the specialists and for literature.
Besides the four socialists, the German writer of Romania, Herta Mâmer, was included.
The Nobel price for Medicina has received two biology, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with his countryman Jack Szostak for research in Chromosone area.
The price for chemically received the Israelite Ada Jonat together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the attachment of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin lost the Nobel price for the economy, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only expert category in which no woman received a noble price in this year was physical.
This price has today the Property Charles Kao for the research in the glassfasern area and George Jobith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD-Chip finding, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote.
Each of these prices has received the diploma, the Nobel Media and the certificate on the acquisition of the money price.
It contains millions of Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several price chargers in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the President Barak Obama has received the most expected peacenobel price in Oslo today afternoon.
In his speech, he recognized the controversy of his name because he is at the beginning of his way, and also at the top of the country, which leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In view of his own, however, he added that wars are needed in certain situations for the suffering of the world freedom, even if the price is high for it.
Minister Janota adds the retreat. Klaus invited him to the village.
The President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister for Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday morning, who thinks of his residence in the Government because he has not agreed with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form of this was released by the Deputy Assembly on the middle-week.
The budget and may also remain Janota in the cabinet will be the subjects of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
It says that the status is too high, which also enhances the crisis of public funds.
The meeting was informed by the President Radim Ochvat.
About his further stay in his function Janota wants to negotiate with the Premier, Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should economy with a depth of 163 billion crowns.
However, at the middle-week, the proposals on the left-party were voted and increased the money for the employees, the maintenance of social services and the direct wages of agricultors.
The Government has agreed with the proposals of social democracy that it is covering the budget.
It is why between the left party on one side and the Government, the Klaus and the Justice Party, on the other hand, has occurred a scarce in-political fight, therefore the questionnaire on the further work of the fisher officer cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party have agreed in the pre-fishing.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of sphere measures, which has been implemented by the fisheries Government in herbst, and that, after its understanding, will end the State debt.
Klaus, who can sign the State Budget law, but does not need, said today in the debate-up with the undertaking, that the majors have reduced a longer time the "essential problem", which represents the "inconsistent deficit" of the public funds.
See opinion there is no solution anymore today.
A improvement could only lead to a strong government that could build on a larger consensus of political parties.
The President of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, concluded that the budget is cruel, and the Government should reject its further existence.
The ODS Steel President, Petr Necas, said to the CTK that the concept of the Office Cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is obviously not working anymore.
Premier fisherman, in the editor, repeated similar words as "stark exhausts".
The CSSD Chief, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolanek word that the status is cruel that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and the 200 billion crowns exceeded.
The CSSD evaluated the approval of the State budget for the next year as a success.
The peoples were also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claimed that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unsupported" of the world shows much from the country, of its fight and victories despite some critics, that the main role was occupied by an Ananian shower.
The story told about sports, race conditions and about Nelson Mandela.
The unnecessary fight against the racial Apartheid Government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, presents in his life history of the Oscar Shooters, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-year Mandela whether he could represent him in Eastwood movie.
Another important role takes Matt Damon.
I said to him, "If I'll play you, I have to meet you.
The two-seventy-year-old player who had received the price for his role in Eastwood-Drama from the box area "Million-Baby" had already set the leader of the movement to decrease the slavery, from which to the end has become slave holder, a fictim American president, but also God in "Evan All-Mighty", but only rare people who are still lebild and for many people as important as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for his active activity at the end of the apartment in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990 and has been president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was exposed to the peace-nobel price.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "injured", and at the same time it is the name of the English author William Ernest Henley, issued in 1875.
The request was how to speak
The film shields a real event, in Nelson Mandela, his powers with the capital of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pinik, to find the country. The new president Mandela knows that his people are still racial and economically divided at Apartheid.
He believes that he can take some of his people through the sport, therefore he decides to be some of the rugs players who belong to the outsides worldwide.
The South African team grows up to the world cook of 1995.
Freeman has given several years to bring the Mandela story to the Chinese invasion.
He did not have any other goal than playing this role to approach this reality as much as possible, said Freeman.
The greatest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The shower said that if he and the world policies were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela to eat with him at night and be behind his talk.
The most important for him was to shoot Mandela's hand.
I found if I shoot your hand, I take your energy, it'll be over, and I felt that I know what you feel, he said.
It is important for me to be another person.
Matt Damon presents in the film François Pinner, Captain of the National Rugby Team, in which the white players have considered.
The shower said he had six months of time to prepare for the role in the hard round world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met piger first inside the house.
I remind me when I sounded to the Turklingel that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pinner in my life was: 'In the movie I look much greater.'
Despite the obvious difference in the state of players in comparison with their real examples, he has received positive reviews under the leadership of Eastwood "Invictus: Invictus" and is also talking about looks on a Oscar.
The Daily Variety film criticist, Todd McCarthy, agreed with his evaluation in the following words: "This was a very Property story, a very well-exported film."
In the film reviews on the rotentomatoes.com sites, Invictus 76 Pro received positive assessments.
Light secret over Norway: The Russians have tested a rakete
On Norway, a particular light effect was to be observed.
The Russian Defence Minister first said last night that a intercontinental Balistic Rakete was tested outside the Norwegian border.
But the start was not again, and the rackets covered as the type "Bulava", which would originately be the stupidity of the Russian Army, will be slow to the alptraum of the Russian Generality and the Premier, Vladimir Putin.
Moreover, his repeated presence before the racket test had no positive effect on the success of the tests.
Bulava is mostly not started or was preserved in the air.
In the Russian magazines, you are already writing about "Bulava" as about a "rake that doesn't fit".
A racket that doesn't fit, but lights
This already 13 tries, remained normal at the beginning.
On the end of the flight, technical damage has occurred on the rakete.
The engine probably exploded in the racket level.
This time "Bulava" started from the atom-U-boot Dmitri Donskij, which was running under the water of the White Sea.
This type of racket allows the output from the U-boat.
That is why it is probably that this mysterious light caused by an unusual flying object was actually the protected "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first time that it is a Russian racket.
However, the generality has kept up this time and claimed that it is not clearly able to speak of a mistake.
The first two steps of the rakete did not fall out and the case was only affected by the level.
In the previous cases, the engines were similarly prescribed in the first level.
Even if no test start has occurred without error, the management of the Defence Minister only holds six of three for success.
The nearly fifty percent success is therefore fulfilled by the generality with optimism and thus continues to be said that the "Bulava" will flight once without problems and even up to → Hypershall-atom spending heads with a total weight of maximum 1.15 tonnes.
The Legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow by 51 years
The legendary player Vjaceslav Fetisov is represented by 51 years in a Profi Eishockey game.
The former World Master, Olympiager and Stanley Cup -Inhaber helps CSKA Moscow team in the need, and probably is in the Friday Dual KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who has completed his car forty years in 1998, is at the time of the CSKA President.
After Denis Kuljas was hurt, we need another player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will undertake the team.
We only need to clothe some remaining formalities, the Agency AP cited the coach of the Mosca's club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comingback of the famous Eishockey player will only refer to a game.
I think Fetisov is one of these who can adhere the moral of other players, and Nemcinov's companions.
When Fetisov returns to the iron area, he will be AP of the oldest Russian professional eishockey game.
In the NHL, the legendary starmer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and was able to write 15 matches and 26 assistants.
The elderst of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most eishockey players in the history.
In the Threeth of the Soviet Union, he wined two Olympical Gold Metalls, seven World Master Title, and also triumphed in Canada Cup, as well as in the Junior World Mastership.
In the second part of his career, he also collected success in the NHL, where he bought the Stanley Cup two times over his head in the detroit tree.
Since 2001, he is a member of the Eishockey Star Rooms.
Hyundai followed the workshops. All overtimes will be rejected
The business management of the Hyundai car manufacture of the NOSO has agreed with the company to reject all overtimes.
As a result of ordinary overtimes, the company announced the streak preparation on Monday.
This worked by the speaker of the Hyundai Car Fabric, Petr Vanek.
However, the business management wants to be some of the employees on Saturdays in this week.
We should not indicate our completement plan, which is a principle, therefore it was proposed on Saturday, 19 December, volunteers from the reason that two workshops would be conducted, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shop.
It also receives the employees in the afternoon for the Saturday course of 28 November.
Accordingly, Vanek decided to change the type of motivation of the employees for the proposed extent.
Otherwise, they may pay the extent payment or may take replacement allowance on 28 December and thus extend the Wednesday Festival, Vanek brought up.
Furthermore, all employees of the Saturday Saturday shall be paid to the carriage and summer.
In view of the most cruel and burning point of demands and obstacles of the employees that had made the production last week, the business management decided to take effect on the derogation of all surplus for December last afternoon.
Car facilities were forced to work practically every day after the eighth hours.
Since the signature of the Agreement, the strike preparation will be revoked by the communities.
More negotiations between the operation of the car and the employees will be held on Friday after midnight.
At the middle of the middle-week, the Officer Petr Kuchar said that if they can sign the inheritance of the requests of some and a common document, they are ready to resume the strike preparation.
The situation in the car facility has been attempted last week, in the middle of the week, when approximately 400 employees were spontaneous because of constant overtimes.
They also protested against the bad conditions of payment and adequate schemes.
However, the business management believed that the workers needed to make the rest of the needs of car delivery.
The employees also requested in their Monday preparation calling for the workers who had interrupted the production in the previous middle.
In the area of the extent, the workshops are invited to reduce the overtime work to a minimum.
Moreover, they call for the payment of 5000 crowns in this year.
The Hyundai car factory is now busy 2000 people.
The serial production was started in the company in November last year.
To this September, approximately 80,000 vehicles have been produced here with the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects HIV virus
The Team of Czech and German Protectors tests new connections to involve the spread of HIV virus in the organism.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that he also acts in the viruses who are already resisting medicines.
This fact overwhelmed the consciousness that the connection to usual virus variants does not affect as strong as one of the medicinal products already existing.
AIDS disease cannot be healed yet.
However, patients can extend their life and prevent the increase of HIV virus in the body.
However, your admission is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete pregnancy of virus increase also has the development of resistant viruss in consequences against which no medicines are more effective.
The work of the experts of three academy institutions of the CR agencies, the VSCHT (Chemic-electrical school) and the University in Heidelberg opens the way to interfere with virus resistance.
You have demonstrated that the substances contained as metalocarborane affect the egg that is responsible for the increase of HIV virus.
The metalocarboranas are connections of bor, water, carbon and cobalt.
These connections block virus increase in other ways than all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the socialists have reached new ́ improved connections prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular pharmacokineism of their connection to the virus oil.
The meta-carbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-dimensional cows consisting of atomy of bar, hydrocarbon and carbon and associated with a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Home and sustainable virus
HIV protease is eggs of HIV-virus, which is indispensable for the vital cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV-virus collapse caused by HIV-protease, there would be no rare infection virus particulates.
If we disable HIV protease, we also eliminate the increase in virus in the body of the patient, declare the economy in the press report, issued by the Institute for Organic Chemical and Biochemie of the Academy of the CR.
In the work held in the journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, the professionals describe the whole series of connections in which two couples of coffee (see Table) are linked by a short organic chat that then is systematicly changed.
Something weak but reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reagence glass, including against their persistent (resistance) variants winned by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborane on the usual enzym variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, but does not lose their effect on the resistants against which the medicinal products are often uneffective.
The unique efficiency mechanism as well as its other features such as biological and chemical stability, low dignity and the possibility of further chemical plants, make the meta-carboranas interesting connections for further research on the development of effective drugs against HIV, Pavlina Rezacova, leader of the structural biological laboratorium of the Institutes for organic chemical and biochemie and of the Institute for Molekular Production of the Academy.
Conflict for Budget. ODS went to fishermen, who turns
The President of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, repeated the approved budget for the next year as "grownful" and the Government of Premier of Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The opinion of the ODS was the President as a "stark debate".
It can be time for the analysis.
The representative President of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Office Cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is obviously not working anymore.
After Necas, the President has to decide whether he intends to be a minority in Parliament if it is the fight against the growing deficit or whether it is to remain in the Office with the links of Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the social democrats to the problems of the public defense is dimetrical, and Necas has pointed to it.
The European Parliament adopted the budget for the 2010 average, however, with links parties' amendment proposals on more than 12 billion crowns.
The Parliament has increased the money for public employees, for the detainment of social services and for direct payments to the agricultors.
The Government agreed with the proposals of social democracy that it covered the budget.
Czech Republic should economy with a residue of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the salle before voting, so it has followed the request of the Government, because the changed budget is only a less bad variance of the budget provision.
Disturbance and senselessness
The Ministry of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about its disappointment and feeling of senselessness, which the Prime Minister Jan Fischer stated that the Government has yet evaluated the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to return to the case that the amendment proposals would be adopted, the situation would appear differently.
According to the Czech TV, Janota reported to the Premier on Monday after the government business.
He said that he was transferring his remains in the office.
That is why his distortion is about the negotiations of the budget.
As far as the fishermen are responsible for the further battle with the budget Deité, they have not done anything in the Government, according to Necas, to the social democracy's nominants (CSSD), who have made the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will return if the Parliament continues to adopt the laws that increase the level of law, such as the hospitals and pensions, or the service legislation.
Topolanek: The Ministers nominated by ODS did not wrong
This is the case of the Prime Fisher and the entire government.
The named ministers of the ODS have not made any error, Topolanek has highlighted in a report from the United States.
It has indicated that in some ministers, people are in a steward-president function who recognize TOP 09 who agreed against the budget.
Necas pointed out that if fishermen decide to deal with the fight against the dealt-height of the public finances, "is it perfectly logical and right that he is able to deal with the majority of the currently in Parliament."
Then he cannot consider the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I have not followed this, and if this happens, then I will take care of it, the Defence Minister Martin Bartak, appointed by the citizens, said to the journalists in Parliament.
The Premier fisherman followed the meeting of the European Council on the midnight after Brussels.
The ODS returned to the desire of the Premier
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the changed budget at the middle Week in Parliament if the Prime Minister would expressly request the Members of the citizens' democracy that they would enable the adoption of the budget.
We don't think we're children of waisen, we're not small children, then he answered the question whether the ODS has not been rejected in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the President of the parliament in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would fuck.
As soon as I dismissed the mandate, I knew that in the next months, it would be a positive reaction to the Topolanek himself to the ballshiwation of the Parliament and the Zers.
Following the new drive plan of the CD (Checkian railway) less moves will take the same road price.
The Czech railway ended or restricted since 13 December some less loaded shoes and local moves, but other connections are strengthened.

Annual account for regional railways: increased by 200 million
The shoes are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Defense, in total, the railways are received to compare the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, four billion crowns, as in this year. The local movements provide the areas, they pay for it in the next year eight billion crowns, and the State shoots three billion.
This year the regional moves are 200 million Czech crowns.
For the local moves and the shirts, the railway has re-completed a tehnight contract until now, the contract has always been completed for only one year.
The railway lo ́ the system, maybe it has not taken it to increase prices in the large majority of the vehicles.
There are only changes in single-day CD networks and available eLiska web facilities.
For travelers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased by 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the dangerous stack until now he was united for the travel between the circles and costed 160 crowns.

The history of South Africa relates to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes into the Ananian Chinese "Invictus: the Invictus", which includes a part of the life history of the former president of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the worldwide fighter against the Apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, which has been chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The role of the Legendary South African Champions in Rugby, Francois Pinik, received Matt Damon.
The film's film beginning will also be reported by criticians and public reactions.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar price, then in 1993 with the Klerk the peace-nobel price.
As Presidents of the Republic of South Africa, it was chosen in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to China in one time, where the Preparations for the World Mastership are at the southern Africa, but the media simultaneously reduce the publicity with anxious news about the growing race and the discrimination of the inhabitants from the black majority.
According to the News Agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are primarily positive, despite numerous preservations against the main role of Hollywood Stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his own words after the new movie.
From this role, I have dreamed many years and have prepared me well.
Sometimes I met Nelson Mandela personally so that, as you say, I can receive its energy, he took up in the interview after the festival premier of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can invoke this film to Mandela's personality and his message.
That's a story of South Africa, but it's about everybody, he's added.
In the Dress of the Rugby-National Teams
The film is based on the booking of the British writer John Carlin, which is free translated in the role of the enemy `: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people associated portraits the South African Defensor of Human Rights during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman has tried to join two race and two groups of populations alongside the year and day and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also in his role in the South African National Rubydress on the world cooking field that he has won from South Africa.
For the arrival of the race in the threes, which is almost as a holy action in South Africa, Mandela had great Ov, mostly by the white public, and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Mastership may bring people back to a single people, and the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "square" in the National Team in 1995.
Whether the stressed situation in South Africa is improved, it will only be shown.
However, the white South Africans are skeptic, for example in recent interviews for the Rugby-Fan LN, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the United Kingdom.
The Mastership starts on 11 June 2010.
In Louny's house burns transformators for more than 10 million crowns
The burning tomorrow at the Transformator of the Society Ceps in the shielding station at the Wiskov community in Louny City.
At the brand, Usti na Labem, Luc Marvan, six units included, according to the speaker of the circuit firewager Usti.
In fact, the firewall wanted to burn the transformators, but later it changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mixing of water - shame and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformator internal shortcut.
Nobody was hurt, the Haâe's appealed according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova, the security management system.
The damage was estimated at a number of 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be seized after the burning.
The severe transformator must be replaced by a new transformator according to Mandadova.
Over 10 years, Ceps has not happened anything similar to the company, mistakes these types are rare, complement it.
The energy supply was not interrupted, according to the CEZ CEZ speaker for North Bohemes, Sona Holingerova, which has not affected the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is employed in the Czech area as a sole operator of the management system, which is electrical guides of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It holds, renews and develops 39 shields with 67 transformators with electric energy in distribution systems and guidelines with a length of 4339 km over.
Jancura erhe’s straf for the disruption of the three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, has been punishing today because of the offense against three social-democratic leaders.
Contra Michal Hasek from the South Sea, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice region and the leader of the district Olomo, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute intelligence in the radio journal.
The complaint relates to the efforts of the company to operate regional movement in some areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we're taking out the rosines, and we've sold the boat only over the range of how it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more closer than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that have been completed last week.
That's what we're doing, nothing else left than we're doing.
Because of this deliveration of the company Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he concluded that he has evidence from all areas that they have taken their steps in accordance with the European law.
This is why we propose a complaint for the European Commission.
Hasek maintains the exhibition of the penalty for the further continuation of Jancura's medialeshow, which serves him as free publicity for his society and for his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good name and the good call of my territory, and I also encourage further leaders.
I assume that in this case, too, it will be cleared that it is Jancura who manipulates the public and uses false and uncertain arguments in the area of regional trafficking, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in the publication, which will be indicated on the negative step of the areas.
He said to the radio journal that he would submit the campaign after Wednesday and want to continue it after the new year.
He claimed that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign has started Jancura after the areas of the regional traffic operations with the Czech railway, and no statements have been issued for the task in a height of 150 billion crowns.
After Vancura, such behavior is legal and in contrast with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the movement in the areas, Jancura, he also threatened a lawyer of the CSSD.
The only trial was if we don't think we could also lose the bus licences.
He represented himself as a lawyer of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura said to the radio journal today.
Impression against pneumockeys free and voluntary
Inflation against pneumockeys changes the habit since January.
It must be first free and voluntary for the families.
But now the votes are reported that the commitment would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumocoke.
The medical institution already sets the maximum prices of vaccines to pay the hospital insurance.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccine
Impopulation free for August Children
Since January, children can be imprisoned freely against pneumockeys born on 2 August and later.
The condition that they have not received a vaccine dose yet.
Whoever has started with vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay further repeated vaccine himself.
The first vaccine dose must be given between the 3 and 5th month of life of the child.
In the past year, a fourth of the families made their children imprisonment against pneumocoke.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children, four doses are required.
In all cases, the experts appreciate that the hospital insurance for vaccine doses is 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
But you are saving in the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
By now, the State has issued approximately 500,000 per year for all area impairment of children.
Implementation of obligation was introduced with the same named Janota package.
Pneumococs caused medium-inflammation, but also serious infections of brain infections and blood disorders.
Infections of pneumokic infections, we die after study in hospitals per year up to 28 children in age to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the responsibilities of children against pneumockeys were introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will vaccination be obligation?
At the same time, this vaccine could be a future obligation.
Since January, it shall be paid by the insurance and will be voluntary.
That the obligation would be better, for example, the leader of the Civil Association of Nalas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association we've already been for long-term pneumockey impunity.
The experts at the international conference, to which our association was shared, were not very satisfied with voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have learned to do it at least.
I think this is the way we need to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccine procedure against pneumocoke.
At this moment, we do not add this, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its incidences, the doctors say.
The president of the company of practical child doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, indicates that a voluntary vaccination has their deficiencies.
If all children were vaccinated, you could think of the reduction of the repeat vaccine, "In a situation where the vaccine is so much, we understand the political decision that this vaccine has been started as voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80% of the parents will imprison their kids against pneumocoke from the next year.
The vaccination against pneumockeys is also adequate to pay this as the first area impairment by the hospital insurance and not by the State.
The insurance should issue the money for the prevention so that they will be saved for further treatment, which is in charge of Cabrnochova.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, there is anxiety of the practical child doctors relating to the implantation of vaccines.
According to the original condition, vaccines should be purchased by the insurance and the doctors should then receive them on the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some of the lawyers assured that the insurance could "exduce the money from the hospital insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance pays them.
After the rate, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
It's not going to be easy, Cabrnochova says.
US artist's son's shared in the "muse's depth"
The son of the famous Fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal the billions of 20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was invited by 90 feet in his vehicle with attachments.
It means, Frank Frazetta Junior and another man had used a bagger to enter the museum in the Pocone mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is known for his presentation of designs such as Conan of Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the news agency Press, the artist stopped at the time of the event in Florida.
AP cited an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could be motivated by a family failure.
The Agency reported, as a police officer, appealed to Frazetta Junior, he was told by his father that he should enter the Museum with all means to bring all the ships into a camp.
The Agency shared that Frank Frazetta Senior had granted any authorisation.
Laboratory defends status and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and delays given in the preliminary report against the criticisms of opposition, economic and community.
The conservators said that Alistair Darling would have allowed a "super" opportunity to show that he was seriously thinking about the reduction of the defects by exiting the decisions until the election.
The tax cancer also decides that he aimed at workers with low and medium income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social insurance and a 1 percent capture limit of the public salaries for 2011.
Social security
However, the workshops have protested that Nedriglon receivers will be punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned about the "processing problems".
The highlighting of the social security, at approximately 3 billion British pounds per year, has increased the economy, which says that this is a tax on workplaces, although the attention should be on economic growth.
The increase restricted to those who deserve more than 200,000 £ per year will be considered about 10 million employees.
SWERPUNCTION OF THE VORABE ETATURES
Increasing social insurance by more than 0,5 % from April 2011
In this year, the economy's rupture is more than the expected 4,75 %.
New 50 % payment on banking bonuses
1 Pro-reduction of the corporate tax for small enterprises
Tax charges for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increasing State pensions by 2,5 %
According to the estimates of the tax office, a person with an annual income of 30,000 £ will be poorer about 90 £ per year and a person with 40,000 £ per year will be poorer for 190 £, while a person with 10,000 £ annual income will be richer at 110 £.
The Ministers said that their objective of deduction was "swak decisions" until 2013, but they also said that 60% of the charges of additional tax would fall to the 5% of the higher representatives.
Financial Minister Stephen Timms concluded that the skizzied tax increases and exhausts in comparison with the necessary measures "a troop on the heavy stone".
"These are great numbers. They will bring us the deficiency and this is also necessary for the period of the next four years," he shared the BBC.
Timms said he was convinced that the economy would return to growth until the end of the year.
The Laboratory Party's predicts on the future economic growth – which affects the amount of the new debt and the difficulty of the demand – were asked after the tax cancer was forced to revise previous numbers.
He said in his opinion that the economy would probably be cut about 4,75% in this year - although more than the decrease of 3,5%, which was proposed in April – while the debt would be of 3 billion £, as previously suggested.
"Decreased opportunity"
The conservatives who want to start a new public campaign on Thursday to warn before the "School Crise" of Labor said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds in the next six years is uncontainable.
They agree that the Ministers have dismissed to present a believed plan, how they will pay this back and press "synish" before weak decisions until the election - which must be placed at the latest in June 2010.
"You haven't said anything about what they're going to do," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "You had their opportunity to do this, and they left them away."
"The significant announcements are made only after the choice, whoever wins it."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be kept before future shortcomings, other than in the proposals of conservatives, which will be viewed as faster and better.
However, the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and depths will be used to cover the depths for the next year, not to reduce the debit, and thus argument that the plans are "build on sand".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that some of them at the time of notifications - such as the above inflation adjustment at some invalid rents in April Next - would exclude the tax cancer to the predictment of the vote, because the money could just be retrieved in the next year.
The Labour insists to provide additional assistance when people need them at the most need and that the situation will be reexamined in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the Ministers have not given any statistical details outside 2011, the economics say that the pressure on the public issues will only come to the middle-term travel.
The recognised fiscal investigations Institute said that the numbers of the tax cancer would mean powerful disasters in many areas, possibly in the areas of transport, high-school, economies and defence.
"It's lacking the pain only on later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements will be made only after the choice of anyone who wins it," the Roger Bootle, economic advisers in the economic checking undertaking Deloitte.
"This was just the high preab state report, the markets recognize it."
FBI investigates "American citizens' arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the deceit of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a house in Sarghoda, in the Pandschab province, shared the `ananian message in Pakistan of the BBC.
The FBI said it would be investigated whether that are the same men who have missed the last month in the United States of Virginia.
The US Foreign Minister said she was also looking for information about men.
Three of them must be Pakistanian descendance, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Jemenic background.
"If they are state citizens, of course, we are very interested in the points of accusation which will be presented to them and under which circumstances they will be kept," said Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed of the arrests and was associated with the family of the missing students.
"We work together with the Pakistan authorities to find out their properties and the purpose of their attempt to stay, if it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistanian message in Washington shared that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the home police had already been interested in the house before, and that has not yet been accused of the men arrested.
The News Agency Re Rébés reported that foreign minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States need to "build closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eliminate the terrorism infrastructure, which continues to recrutate and educate people".
The five students were reported as missing by your families in North Virginia.
Amnesty condemns "missbreaks" in Iran
According to a report of the Human Rights Organization, Amnesty International is still bad about human rights in Iran as in the past 20 years.
The report details "measures of misuse" by the Regime, both before and after the presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was struck and burned with cigarettes. Another said that he was threatened with dismantlement.
The Iran rejected the previous criticism of his human rights.
Of institutions said that such criticisms are politically motivated.
After the advised election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedschad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and killed decades, which led to the largest road protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Decades received prison penalties and accusers said that at least five people were condemned to death.
The BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the Protest of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the misuse claims recognised and organized the closing of the Kahrizak staff.
But since the authorities had no more tolerance for criticism, our correspondant said.
"Falsch Guest"
Amnesty International quoted the report of the 26-year informatic student Abraham Mehtari, who said he was accused of the "work with Facebook networks" and of the protest against election results.
"They shot me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head, and they threatened me with death, and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a misunderstood and became, still blue and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty shared with.
The decreased presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were followed to death in August in prison and managed others.
The Iranian authorities denied the deficiencies, but admitted that crimes had been found.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner, who said that he was held in a container in Kahrizak with 75 other than eight weeks.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian Parliament and the judges had found a committee that should examine the injuries after the election and the reactions of the Government, but that Amnesty, the mandate and the power of these organs would not be clear and the results of the Parliamentary Committee were not published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 persons were arrested to preserve further demonstration.
Skihang was established in the city Park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to convert a sign in Bristol into a wheat campaign.
The Skipiste of this park event was 16 half-professional skippings and Snowboarders who fighted for money prices.
At the bottom of the hand in Brandon-Hill Park, there was a short shopping chain at the beginning of a 100 meters long hang.
Student John Hickman, who studys medicals in the fourth year, said there was a wonderful cup from the cup of the hangs, but it was very beautiful.
It's a beautiful cup with all the lights of the town that glide below.
He added, "There are some of the best skin carriers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were granted for the best exported arts or trucks on the hand.
After the event on the morning day, the snow will be left to the snow.

Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a svulary state.
In a time in which the Swiss Elector voted for a construction offer for minerals and the care of the common islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an Ananian academic, wrote a funded and fully translated report on whether Muslims can be integrated in one of the most explained European societys — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "Why don't French love heads" (Original Title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), a elegant and closely argumenting question that the country shared and occupied and whose effects were still observed today.
Besides the newest book offers a more comprehensive and cooking spectrum.
As a good anthropolog, he wants not only to know what the more and media say about the islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He has delivered months in Moschees, Schools and Institutes, now 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic freedoms".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most disturbing.
Should a moslem marry in a mosque or a rash (or both)?
Should young muslims learn about evolution and homosexual rights?
Can a muslim woman marry a non-muslimian man?
Is it allowed for a muslim to use a tax-oriented banking system to get a hypoteque?
These seems to be profane, he claims that they do the daily life, in contrast to the political drames that the media occupy.
The author recognises a new generation of owners, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, one of the Arab Muslims and Academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good moslem, and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern sülular society.
You don't have any arguments on their side.
The conservatives are misstrauously against the idea of a French or → islam.
The thoughts and activists who asked Bowen are most uninformed with their salafi gender – the defenses of the purist Sunnite Islam, which is connected to Saudi Arabia, show a small, but influent presence in Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is the opinion that muslims and French S ·cularism could be agreed.
But a agreement requires a gift and take on both sides.
He asks where French political decision-making (and the intellectual elite, which is so suspicious of the training of church and State) is really committed to pluralism.
He notes that Muslims may have experienced a stronger treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have to make their historical compromises with the Sülular Republicanism.
He prefers to recognize a "depreciation of values" as a growing practicism.
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, you are ready to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most comfortable view of the world
The arctic changes faster and dramaticer than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that she knows smile with alarming speed and takes life with herself that can never survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, ship carriers and fisheries interests have been in the newly open water, with diplomates, advocates, and now authors in their kitchen water.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, is in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the north, the iron.
In the complicated story and of the Walffang, he describes the long tradition of arctic researchers who have proved themselves on the iron.
Admiral Nelsons meeting with a icebrand as a tighter 14-year-year fischerrich to the sea, which only struck with his muscle coal, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young boys who were arrested when they weep behind their recently killed mothers were brought into zoos and circus.
A circus upload in the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ironbers at a presentation.
Even today's zoo facilities are still typically a million of the lives of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the iceber in Singapore has become very green by the algens that grow in the hairs of his pelce.

Marine infanterists were among the 6.000 in Arlington Kränze
The De'Angello Robinson is free to travel seven hours with the bus to put a single cronce on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and the other marine infanterists who traveled by Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Friedhof in Arlington, to shake the graves, the day was a tribut to the men and women in which they had passed.
In a few months, from which we can always be brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to eat the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6.000 volunteers who had gathered themselves on Saturday morning to put cronces on the graves of veteran in several sections of the Arlington Föhof.
Morrill Worcester, inhaber of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, founded this tradition in 1992, when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred grapes on the Friedhof in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who take these travels each year, keep in different cities at the way to perform events that people are dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also found a useful organization, Wreaths Across America (Crannces in the whole America), which also extended the event to other states.
In this year, volunteers put more than 16.000 cronces on the tombs on the Arlington-Fühlhof, in the areas of Pentagon, on the graves of the National Friedhof Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and at the United-Airlines Airlines Airport 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart facility spent for the second time more than 150,000 € for the purchase and transport of the cronzes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she took the travel to Arlington in the memory of her husband, a disrupted professional soldier.
Although her husband is not prepared in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return to the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution to civilians to submit our soldiers.
It's like the clue of a family grave.
In packaging in the layer of warm clothing, the volunteers and the walls of the Friedhof were weakened over the spread race areas and the hills of the Friedhof.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2th World War and the Vietnam war as a goal, since they are not visited as often as the newer tombs as the agents.
The vote was happy, children played and couples kept on their hand, while they brought the fresh kidneys to the green grassing stones.
Each round cranz was dark green with a small red slider fixed on the top side.
The section 60, which is near and where the majority of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained nearly hard.
The United Service Organizations spent 1.000 cronces to smile this section, but the darkest vote of the current war was fulfilled in this area.
Some weep openly, praying, and families and friends stayed together in the railway air.
Some read the names in the stone contained, while others moved to small black-white space cards that were cut off for those in the flat shame whose grave stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgotten the bitter trees before her son's grave.
She was taking 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the bursts of the Marine-in-frenterie underof David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free, my son paid for it, she said.
"If I'm not longer, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. Government of Cuban authorities established
The Cuban Government has adopted an officer of the US Government, the mobile phone and the notebook computers in the country, saying the representatives of the Foreign Minister on Saturday.
The employer, who could not be identified until now, for the development alternative Inc. with sitting in Bethesda.
The Society's projects for customers, such as USAID, the United States members for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officer of the United States interest refund in Havanna attempts to gain access to prison, arrested on 5 December.
The special complaints have not yet been published, although, according to Cubanian law, a Cubanian citizen or a foreign agency can be arrested for almost everything under the accusation of the "certification".
All so-called counter-revolutional Assets, including easily protests and critical writings, are a risk of arrest.
Government enemies and statements are considered as a serious crime.
Kuba has a growing blocker community, which is indicated by the reporter Yoani Sánchez, who describes more than how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government operators.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested a authorisation to leave the country to obtain prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an Ananian employer will probably increase the spending between the Communist Government of the Castro Brothers in Cuba and the Obama Government, which had a "slow" approach to improve the relationships with the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times.
The new US policy implies that the United States will be given an opposite if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Kuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average service of a government officer is 15° per month.
The Cuban Government only allows normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they will be used highly to send text messages, since a 15-minute telephone talk would cost a daily payment.
The use of the Internet is extremely restricted on the island.
It is accessible in fair hotels and there for foreign customers and in some government institutions such as universities.
Cubaners who want to log in often have to report their name.
To many websites, access is limited.
On Cuba, the arrest of a American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in Cuba in prison are sitting for crimes like ́s ́fishes behind the grills, Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the US Interest Report in Havanna.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and arrest are clearly wrong.
A activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, Jose Miguel Vivanco, leader of the Division of the Group "Human Rights Watch", which recently reported a hard report on the freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, the same cuba", a invitation to the establishment of Raul Castro as a leader of the country, who replaced the diseased older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the complaints were very often arrested, condemned and arrested within one day.
He said that every solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States to move themselves to the time of both countries for more dialogue preparation.
Pakistanian Government Defense Plan to send men to Afghanistan
The Pakistanian authorities discovered a fairly leading head of an offense that aimed to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers and said that they hoped that this case could help to discover an extensive network of terrorist prosecutors who seek the Internet for radicalized young men.
Experts said that they were looking for an invisible rebellious, as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of these comments had been given on the Internet videosite YouTube acceptable to terrorists.
Saifullah, after their arrival to Pakistan, was attempted to help them get the remote territory in Pakistan's tribe, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training campaign.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince Al-Kaida leaders that men were not part of a threat to submigration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held over days in the strict city of Sargodha, far away from the inevitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist flight.
They were viewed as part of a hidden operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government officer who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The Government officer said that the men were no longer disappointed and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to access the Al-Kaida camps when they were adopted by the Pakistanian penalties.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are asked by the FBI - underlines the decision of the applicants in the execution of future terrorists and perhaps more important, in the decision of who is confidential.
Since the proposals of 11 September 2001, the US secret service has made a thing of greater difficulty to submit human activity posts within Al Kaida.
The prosecutors of the organization are acting as potters who do not allow those who have no serious commitment for the Holy War and who could be spies.
American whale-recurrence recruits are undergone by A Kaida a special test, said an analyzer.
As a result of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda, they will also be considered adequately attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the ranchöchster analyser of the NEFA functioning with seating in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become many more careful in the past years in view of who they have placed access because the US secret services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to include someone in these groups, what better way you could follow than the recruiting model that so many have already been followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now a lot more based on the Internet.
Ten thousand demonstrators request climate "Action" in Copenhagen
Ten thousand demonstrators marched here on Saturday through the streets and requested the underhanders in the Bella Congress.
Demonstrators said that 100 000 people had been connected to the event, but the police assessments were more than 25,000.
The event remained relatively peaceful, although a handful masked activist washed small snippets near some government buildings in the town.
On one day, when climate negotiations promoted by the United Nations were small, thousands of activists with transparency forced through the town on which "No Planet B" and one in Spanish explained "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars agreed to the protest, for example, the Danish model, Helena Christian photograph, who said that the journeys to Peru, their mother's birth country, would be able to realize with which problems the country has caused to fight because of the existing impact of climate change.
This is part of the movement foundations why I decided to share in the great demonstration - to continue the word and call the world leaders to bring a good, ambitionated and binding agreement, she said.
It is not easy to do, but it must now be done and there is no longer a way to run.
The police denied the demonstrators too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 persons, mainly because they were masked or led to a cotton.
According to the Danish law, these actions are prohibited by demonstration.
According to a surveyer who doesn't want to be called because he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrants in black clothing have a number of spending bodys near the Copenhagen's main channel, in which several ministers are nearby.
They threw them near the building, he said and fêe to add that they started as light rockets, but then followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the Congress room, people gathered themselves before television screens to follow the demonstration all the afternoon.
But the Protest has not seemed to reach the knowledge of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's main climate operators.
When he was asked whether the demonstration would have an effective effect on the international discussions, he said to English, "This is something that I was not conscious of."
Then he went in Mandarin and said, "Because the event is large, I can't hear what is outside."
He concluded that it depended on the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the consolidation of the broad public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they spend the negotiations or the freedom of others."
Test data show hard-deep race club
The testimony of matthe performance was last week Welcome Messages for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the district Washington is still far behind the schools of the country, the highest performance, the witnesses show that the fourth and eight-year classers have made rapider progress in the past two years than the cities included in Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest numbers of the National Evaluation of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is the hard-deep service club between African and white students, both at local and national level.
The average number of white quarters from Washington D.C. increased in the last two years from 262 to 270 (in a scale of 500), which increased their African equivalent trials, but only three points from 209 to 212.
The service club has actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight clases remained based on a statistically disabled point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the test data because the test range was not enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more emotional.
The white and black quarter clothing trend 2003, when the first NAEP was found in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that children have reached both groups has been grown in this period, the difference has not been reduced by 58 points now.
Some educational workers of the district have expressed their concern last week that the results of school officer Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Civil Master Adrian M. Fenty have been offered to the majority of white students who are also strong children.
This indicates that we have highlighted the total value by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is difficult and difficult, Jeff ́ith, representative member of D.C. Voice, a useful group that comes to the Education Equality in Washington D. C.
I'm not going for a span of two or three points and below, the Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Foundation School.
Brown, a often criticist of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test numbers is that the media schools of the city need to be appealing.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what I am afraid is that we do not use the time and energy that we should use for our mediumschool.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to be justified by the needs of the weak students.
In this herbst, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading plan, the Wilson-Lese system, aimed at students in the top classs of the basic school and the media school, which have not found basic lessons at the beginning of their school course and which are significantly behind their equal classmates.
The daily Mathea, a teacher plan that takes from the child garden to the sixth class games and experiences in front, was brought under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey to Washington, and this teacher plan will be given some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think that we must continue to work to allow the best measures to benefit the students under the note level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to improve the system's total performance and continue to provide the social money and the resources for the weak schools that are necessary to reduce the cloud.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor for Education at the 日 of California in Berkeley, who investigates the local test results.
The conventional health means to direct its resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could lead to political effects that work against this important agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as in other stated school insights, that it is trying to keep the white and black medium.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city quarters so that all families, independent of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now schoolinspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the service club is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to competite with the Charter School.
The school year has to be raised at approximately 200 days in order to have the power to change, Janey, who came to a agreement with his teacher work last year over 185 days per year, which he considered as "a milenstein" on the way to increase in the next Treaty.
High-school education for more people than future perspectives
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a sound wheel.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, grows out and blinks a moment in view of the white columns, the grid stones and the smaragd green race.
Gracielas parents almost completed the High School in El Salvador.
In recent times, Graciela, who was hidden in Silver Spring and now in Riverdale le¤, had never set a foot on a college-campus.
Their attitude and the other eighth clasters of the group, who announced the Gettysburg, where the education costs per year 38.690, was better than the one who feared an enthusiastic future student.
"Yeah! I'll be here soon!" called Graciela, who wants to study medication, when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtly said when you were reported the low professor-to-student relationship of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited at their three-day tour and now they completely took the message that was intended: The question is not whether to go to the college.
The question is where.
On the other hand, there is a growing care about the large number of children of Spanish immigrants born in the United States, which do not end the high school or become pregnant, but, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive college education that is necessary to grow up in the middle.
In fact, one of the five of these "two generations" of the Spanish Americans concludes the college – which is a significant benefit, because many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without concluding the high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say because they show the road forward for a generation that will play a major role in the workers of the country.
Those who investigate powerful children often say that they have a natural deficit for the school and an inhabiting facility for their success.
They also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to carry out their lack of confidence with schools.
But advice programmes also play a great role by helping Graciela and millions of children like they come to college, especially if these efforts continue for a longer time.
If you consider the income weak children whose parents do not have experience and ability to help them in the search of the system, a single action will not be solved at any time, Patricia Gándara, researcher in the Property of California in Davis, who investigated hispano-American students.
We need to think about to provide for these children a subconscious network from the pre-school to the high school.
The Federal Programme, which Gracielas College Tour financed, is a useful example.
It is > GEAR UP - A loop high - and provides more than 300 million per year for local school systems to start school preparation programs starting when income students are in the middle school and continue until they have completed the high school.
According to the United States Education Department, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, from whom more than 60% have gone to college.
The Iraqian Oil Ministry concludes treaties with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the thinking of violence and political instability, the Iraq Government can bring greater oil companies to rebuild its proper infrastructure in two cases concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqian Oil Ministry draw close to that China, Russia and Oil Company are ready to play an important role in the renewal of the Iraq Oil industry, which has been acquired since years by war and economic offences.
American companies could only buy shares in two of the 10 increased fields.
Seven businesses were paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that has given a command has made the shorter.
Two Annual companies could conclude contracts for increased fields in June.
In the opening of the Iraqic oil industry, the representatives of the Danish Oil Mulitis surprised the analyses.
Finally, after 6 years of war, Iraq opened his gates and instead of US enterprises presented Asian and European road, Ruba Husari, publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, said a online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Safety thoughts that were still underlined by massive coordinated bombs on Sunday and the political instability by the US Military has probably declined from the Oil Society, thus analysts said to engage more in Iraq, which is the largest evidence of the world's oil reserves.
The US companies were in some cases declined because competitors, especially the Chinese and other Stately controlled energy undertakings, have clearly less loan and are better risked because they do not have to delay the shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and O^al Petroleum Inc. were the only companys of Ananias who could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
A larger US enterprises such as Chevron and ConocoPhi ́ps, who have a close relationship with the Iraq Oil Ministry and have been with the technical Council in the last years, have been empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of these weekend contracts.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages on contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the speaker of the Oil Minister, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the largest of the world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can meet its partners and comply with his commitments to Iraq.
In order to increase the expenditure of each field outside the current level, for the purposes of the provisions of the orders provided for by the undertaking, the tax per Barrel Oil was compared to the tax, which was ready for the Ministry to increase the expenditure of each field.
Top-Planer of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US rates attack within the Pakistanian border to Afghanistan, this week will be killed a top-up planner of Al Kaida, reported representatives of the United States terrorism combat on Friday.
This would be, if it would be possible, the second death attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this herbst.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistanian authorities, were killed by a number of rackets that met their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the North Waz.
The original authorities reported that the rackets were decreased by a type of drone, which was used by the → in the unlawful staff of Pakistan.
They moved into a white vehicle in the direction of the Afghanistan border, when the car was found, a representative of a Pakistanian civil secret service from Miran Shah per phone said.
Locational seats who were in detention to belong to the Militarians were running to the place and quickly took all that remained from the "completely broken bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the efficiency of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. terrorism control proved unusual evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leader of the military planner of Al Kaida, leading operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan region.
He was shared in deteriorations worldwide, a leader who wanted to remain anonymous, and refers to the heavy character of the American air attacks on the Pakistanian ground.
It also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He adopted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and placed them in operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The Second Authority Representative said that Somali was quickly raised in the Al-Kaida hierarchie and had best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He doesn't like to be some Americans, said the second authorities' representative, but this doesn't decrease what he represented for us and our associates.
If his death had been killed, Somali, the second leader Al Kaida or Taliban leader, who was killed since September, would have been killed as the similar attack of Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the staff area and three other topactivists.
The time of attacks through the dress of the Property has been returned from a average of six operations per month to two, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, one of the web pages held by an important organization.
The reduction may be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their efficiency and to kill the informants at the same time, reported.
UN leadership in Kabul will return
The leader of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would return to the March official office, which would end a storm official period, which would have been broken down by controls on widespread corruption by the United Nations supported Afghanistan presidential election.
It has been done when the Obama government has decided to send more 300,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN sentence said that he supported the enhancement of the troops, but he also suggested that the US military backing plan, which would begin in 18 months, could allow other NATO governments to distort their fighting forces.
We need to clear the building of the Afghanistan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghanistan that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a Kabul phone interview.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diploma also forced the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil aids to help the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The elevation of troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said that he did not lay down his office, but only one of his family in March 2008 inherited agreement to stay in Kabul only two years.
He said he wanted the notice to the United Nations
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now sending up so that he may have time to provide a substitute.
What I said is that he's starting better looking for a follower, Ide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the past of my preacher and my arrival.
Ban, according to UN representatives, began searching for a replacement.
The United Nations representatives say that he has recently taken into consideration the Swedish-Italian staffan di Mistura, who has led the UN mission in Bagdad and has taken into consideration the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has previously conducted United Nations operations.
Each position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative Peter W. Galbraith had accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to interview evidence of a massive election.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - that has been committed - "the mission has been uncertainly harmful, because it has already been a great measure of scepsia in relation to the international mixture in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the name of a leading civil representative to coordinate the measures of the combat forces in Afghanistan.
He also stressed that the UN-führer allows followers to establish more staff from the United States and other western countries that are for the Afghanistan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in it that their money would be used correctly.
Idee expressed his distortion on the limitation of its powers in Afghanistan and said that the ambitional UN settlement schemes had understood its opportunities to introduce capable people.
The United Nations rules have been so done that I had since May, so he said, only one person could set up.
This is a catastrophic and can't continue so.
U.S. Defence Minister Gates: Iran needs to calculate adequate sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be linked to the Iran because he did not share his atmosphere.
Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in North Iraq during a seven-day journey through the military areas in Afghanistan and Iraq and played the look of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said as an answer to the question of a soldier to the probability of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the past six years, which is the war's own unpredictability."
The government of Obama provides a sanction package for the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also be related to the average.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is required to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less harvested with nuclear weapons, because your people will suffer under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a opinion of the white House speaker, Robert Gibbs, the Ananian Government, has joined the advertising that the Iran must be counted with "credible" consequences if he does not follow the requirements of the UN Security Council and its Atom Monitoring Organization, the International Atom Energy.
The Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear artechnology should be won only for peaceful purposes.
In Geneva, on 1 October, the Iran said that he would resume the debate to restrict his atomic programme and would distort a significant part of his stock stocking to sufficient Uran in exchange for the needed nuclear fuel for his medical research response.
The US Government has committed this type of agreement to build confidence between both parties and time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left the negotiations with the provisional agreements since this time -- in part, the experts say because the Iranian lead is uninvited to whether they should commit commitment to the United States.
The fact that the Iran has simply left the international community regarding some proposals which they had already been approved on the beginning of October has simply said, openly, that the international community, and the Russian and Chinese, was combined in a way of how they had never been in relation to important social sanctions for Iran.
The President Obama decided on 31 December as a term for Iran to respond to these proposals before he continued to follow other options to those called for foreign minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once "expressive sanctions".
In a opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representation in the United States N° condemned what she called on Thursday "based and unfinished controls" of some Iranian security Council members and said they were ready to continue negotiations with the United States and five other world powers, "to achieve a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who would return to Washington last Friday, met the Iraq Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on the morning before he fled to the Oil Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and the Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The spending between the Kurde and the Arab majority in Iraq continues to be high, in terms of limits, property rights and the distribution of public income.
Gates forced both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent the delays of the US plans to reduce the tropical strength until the end of August from 115.000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to spread the Kurdish care of the previous tribe. US representatives cited gates, which were in Masud Barzani, president of the Turkish Government, said: "We will receive your security, your welfare and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A currency change in ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew around by propagandaplacates who thought to them that "Mother Earth is to be silent to discuss other children" and "A baby more means more a grave."
These lessons have learned so well that, as Government officer in Shanghai, who started to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than a child, their answer was directly and finally: "In no case."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, Wang, 31, a staff leader with a 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a child's policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorially dicked, unexpected children who are lovely called "small caiser", a population crisis in the country is raised.
The average birth rate is falling on 1,8 children per couple compared to 6 on the date of entry into force, the UN represents:
The Department for People's Affairs sets up while the number of population groups of 60 years and age in 2020 from 16,7 Pro > 2050 to 31,1 per percent of explosions. This is far above the global average of approximately 20 per cent.
The non-equivalent weight is stronger in rich coasts with designed populations such as Shanghai.
The last year, 60 years of age and age, almost 22% of the reported resident Shanghais, while the rate of birth has been placed under a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, leader of the Shanghaier city population and family planning committee, said that couples have to get children in the productional age to help reduce the proportion of older population shares and reduce the lack of labour forces of the future.
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not so rich -- like the industrial countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-restauration
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's single-child policy must be the most restrictively available by the Governing Communist Party to this day.
Married couples who are opposed to this situation must be counted with great penalty -- until their three-fold annual amount in some regions -- and with discrimination on their workplace.
The Chinese State representatives have admitted this that the critical approach of natural country resources could be avoided which have condemned human rights offences in the implementation of this.
In rural regions, some employees who had already a child have been forced to take away.
Moreover, couples have been allowed to carry out selections, which caused an unnaturally high relationship between men to women.
In the past years, government representatives for people have gradually distorted their attitude towards a child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions -- inhabitants of city, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007 the sound of many hard slogans was mixed.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research of the University of Peking, said that government representatives had recently discussed more radical changes, for example, to place couples two children in which a partner is a single child.
Shanghai was started in July to the first Chinese city, which has started an aggressive campaign to help more births.
Placates that taught families to have only a child have been replaced by almost a night of directives that detailedly describe who comes to question for a second child and how to approve the authorisation.
The town administration has sent local workers and volunteers for family planning to visit couples home and translate information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not just encouraged, said family planning representatives.
Dismissed Reaction
Although officers from a rural small city in Shanghai's foreign areas said that an emergency is to be recognised at the requests of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, however, not reporting any change.
In the community of Huinan with a number of residents of 115.000, only four to five applications are made for a month.
Disappointed Shanghaier officers say that the number of births in the city for 2010 will still lie at approximately 165.000 -- something > 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, leader of the Shanghaier Community of the family planning committee of Caolu, said that financial advantages are probably the main reason why many people do not want children anymore.
You want to give her first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was also legally allowed.
But they, as many Chinese, are only a small illness of the Government's sickness and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be unresponsible.
People in the west evaluate the single child policy falsely as human rights question, Yang, a building engineer whose wife is weaker with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we'll be able to have more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a section.
The problem is money.
Other couples specify psychological reasons for their dusts.
Wang, the staff leader, said she wanted only a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and we were habited that everyone cared about us.
We're not used to take care of others and don't really want this."
Chen Seiian, a 42-year-old, who belongs to a translation undertaking, said that it was unbloomed.
For parents from the middle state with double carries through which the birth rate is deceived, he said that it turns to be it and that it must be egoistic.
The group of 20 to 39 years today grows up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiments and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also, a single child, he said, puts serious requirements at the time of the parents.
A mother must give her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is nine months old, you have to have a life course for the best schools."
Most of his friends are ready to do this one time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first one that has reached a live standard, he said.
We don't want to offer too many victims.
UN group develops a plan for emission reduction
The climate conference, which has been promoted by the United Nations -- which has done up to now by wild posts and mutual accusations -- has set a serious point on Friday with the publication of a document, which will bring an enormous deterioration of the tree gas for the next 40 years, and the industrials must be trained the largest loads in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the system of gases has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way before.
But he was viewed as an important progress in a negotiation that takes time, since the next week more than 100 spectacular policies from all the world will come to Copenhagen.
The text that has been formulated by a UN workgroup that has been created for it is aware of the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that these short-term and long-term world warmth can focus on.
He also offers a palette of options for key issues, such as industrial and large wheel countries, to reduce their CO2 costs and to be the highest limit of the global temperature growth that would be with the political decision-making.
The process will provide a great flexibility, so John Coequyt, leader of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has discovered the six-side document, has compiled a 180-page long negotiation text to put it in the center, which the leader of the United Nations climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, as the "great whole".
It shows the fundamental risk of a possible agreement, in which the industry would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Along with the countries could reduce the emissions to 2050 by 50 to 95 Pro.
The European Community also granted the discussions on Friday an insurance by providing 3,6 billion dollars per year over the next three years to adjust the impact of the climate change - from the master of overcome and woods until the destruction.
On Friday, however, the same verbal fireworks, which had been determined in the last week.
Todd Star has rejected formulations that require the binding reductions of the gas emissions for industrial countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger countries, if they are not financed by the industry.
This move announced that Obama Government is a stronger line with China than a representative of the Bush Government two years ago.
The United States will not undertake agreements without taking greater wet countries and taking measures, so the stars who claimed that the text would not be far enough to ensure that the senaments could also be affected by external residents.
Sterren gave his opinion a hour after the explainment of the Chinese Vice-minist He Yafei, who said that it was not to help the leader of the Ananian climate operator either to "the understanding" or to "the highest inresponsibility" of him that he said the beginning of the week that the United States would not help financially to meet the global warmth.
As a result of the future economic marketing of large world powers in the game, both within the industry and between the industry and the wheel countries have opened bridge lines.
The current battle relates to the salvation of individual economy, as well as the salvation of the planet, whereas China and the United States were responsible for their respective obligations, while poor countries claimed that the two decades of the most influential countries would ignore scientific needs to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting the costs of breaching the gas gas gases, since even the countries concerned have been overtaken, should be aggressive to take the countries with a very high cost of costs for their works.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic rulership as Ulate, which is also known as regional climate change advisers for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that have been highly affected by the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight a legal contract in Copenhagen, despite the leading participants say that the talks would lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The Alliance of the Small Islands with 43 members presented a 24-page contracting draft on Friday morning.
Arturge-Meatsger, leading the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the opening of the small island countries "exercise political pressure on the entire political process" partly because they are now united and requested measures from the Sweden countries such as China and India.
The discussions received a new difficulty when the delegates conceived the fact that most open issues need to be claimed before the arrival of the Governing Boards to reach an agreement.
Higher representatives, such as the Indian Ministry of Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Viceminister, rebelled against their aircrafts and roaded through the bands of the Bella Centre to meetings closed back to press conferences in order to distort those negotiated during the next week.
The pure amount of the congregation -- 13.000 people come to the Congress and out of the day, gitar playing activists make nightly shows where they make them fun over the countries that are forwarded and overwhelmed by their opinion, and contract projects are hand-handed instead of by email -- is already a challenge.
Intensity is just based on: almost all important ministers are here and from midweek will be 60 Governing leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the Global Conservation Organization International.
The weights come.
British first 225 km/h faster move defines the feeling of Monday
On Monday morning at 5 hours 13, a fifish will pass through the darkness to announce a road which represents a revolution in the Vertigue in the United Kingdom.
The first high-speed speed travel in the country will be reached by Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras 225 km/h and leave 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Department Minister, Lady Kelly Holmes will then come to the board of the first Javelin-Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new British service will finally be connected to a international shinenet, quickly, reliable movement and will connect the large Balance areas of Midland, North and Scotland to London.
The reduced province could be living pensions, work times would be radically reduced and the exchange of aircraft and car to train would reduce the national carbon emissions and the stone on the streets.
In the theory, the three large parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds that are needed to build a new national shine network may still take bremse in the British high speeds.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, which will present the Government a implementation study, will be reported on 30 December by Lord Adonis.
Thus he receives a detailed stream map of the next planned level of the high speed network.
The new bathroom line to connect London to the West Midlands will lead to a playspace of five meters in urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is restricted.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final range.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northern-weight leading high speed.
Lord Adonis will react to it in the preservation.
The preferred option is a y-formed stream management that would lead a single high speed streak to West Midlands.
The streak would share in or near Birmingham and a decline would lead the peninsula to Manchester and Scotland westly and another towards the North East to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway inside.
After finishing, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first substrate that would not be opened before 2025 would allow the travelers to return the streak of London-Birmingham in 49 minutes, comparing something over one hour today.
The drafts will give the moves the possibility to run with a speed of 400 km/h, thus the British shinenett would be the fastest Europe.
The first piece was planned so that 400 metres long moves with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people can lead to it.
Up to 18 moves could be operated in the London Birmingham streak per hour.
This would mean again that there would be a final station in London that could be transferred to 200,000 travelers per hour.
In view of the space restrictions in the capital city, it is expected that an existing trainhouse would be built to undertake the high speed network.
Travel experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston has this potential.
Lord Adonis will give up whether this plan should be continued or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures means that a final decision is taken only after the votes of Parliament.
But even if he moves the roads, the shinenet must be built in sections.
The moves were first to change from the high-speed streams to existing shine streams in the north of Birmingham, thus the travel time between London and Scotland would continue at more than three hours.
This applies as a decision-making point in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the train, a direction for the revolution of the skin.
Tax payers come for hypothek for 75,000 pounds of a conservative organisation
Alan Duncan, the leader of the conservative member, has taken into account the tax payer per year thousands of pounds for the costs of an orange, which he read in Wohnhaus in ́ election circle.
The prison speaker of the party, degraded by David Cameron, because he claimed that sub-human members must live "by the magic R". He has increased his hypotheke in 75,000 pounds to build a eyehouse workbuilding in his second house in Rutland.
He was able to take account of the tax payer's additional price income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The responsibility of the underhouse have approved the applications at that time and they have not been asked by Sir Thomas Lee, who conducted a review of the issues of the sub-human members. Last night, Duncan said that the applications could be "not yet cleaner or understander".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-human members, is a two-style house in a village in a choice circle Rutland and Melton.
Nearby homes have achieved a purchase price of almost a million pounds (1,1 million euros).
The earthquake includes kitchen, residence and easier rooms, but the festival of the Office, a department control site of the underhouse, agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he built a winter garden that is used in the plans as "orrangery".
Neighbors described him as a "Glas House for Entertainment".
Duncan was also requested by the Committee for Standards and Privilegies during a recent investigation of its previous hypotheches.
The Committee has released it last month after an examination of its issues from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan has cooked the security for a hypothek over 27406 pounds (300,000 euros) of London houses on his election circle, which he had bought for a year before his election to the Member of Parliament.
This week published documents show that Duncan has been restored as a hypothecnic replacement until March last year, about 1.400 pounds (1.500 euros) per month.
In April, his appropriations increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The rate of Duisceans RBS-Hypothek has not changed during this time, which is about the whole increase in the funding of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal RBS-inflammation hypotheccinity fell from 7,94 Pro日 in December 2007 to 4 Pro日 in the market of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the underground house show that Duncan continued to make its right to $50 pounds per month.
In September, Duncan lost his post as the opposite leader of the subhouse after a subcover reporter filmed him when he said after the season canal, Parliament members would live "of the magic R·.
"It means essentially if you have to live for the State, and how S*****e is treated."
He said, "I have issued my money for my garden, and I have highlighted the request of a disappearing little part of what it belongs.
And I could have asked the whole fucking sum, but I don't."
The Member of Parliament, a billion of his former kare as oilmakers, was first attacked in May because of his exhibitions, as it was clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he discovered with the Fees Office that this could be considered "as overcoming request".
An activist, as a Protest in Duentian Rasen, buried a lock in the form of a fingerprint, after it became the case that he had requested over three years over 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros).
When he was asked about the higher hypothek last night, Duncan said, "This was both by the Festival and the following law to increase values."
He still adds: "There is no debate on exhibition and transparency or a trial of rules or similarity.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
All her believers are coming to wonder Brighton Strandhouse Advents Calendar
Strands in Brighton have found a new life content for the wintermonate as an interactive advent calendar.

He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect the church of people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and celebrate awesome celebrations.
The idea of the street-house advents calendar began to talk to some friends at the evening.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this by our spirituality."
Hard mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate.
Ten thousand people have demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen to request an ambitious and commitmental agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police has made several hundreds of arrests.
At least threescore thousand people sound the police, hundred thousands of the organizers, are marched in the coal of the Danish capital, at the border of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force since 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the climate mobilization in the world helps to illustrate that the "political price" of a mistake in Copenhagen would be very high.
The interactions in the Danish capital found short time after the move passed, as a group of 300 demonstrants, wholely dressed in black, had screwed a window with flaster steel and stones, a journalist of the AFP fixed.
Anti-injured police have been attacked immediately and without respit.
The police has announced that 600 to 700 persons, as you appreciate, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, have been arrested by these extremely violent splitting groups, which have already been identified at Nato Summit in Strasbourg in East France, April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the demonstration organisations, has criticized the conditions under which hundreds of military attachers were established "without distinction", and has underlined that some hundred of you were "always held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme coal with hands and position.
The early peaceful movement has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were located.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters away from the building without trying to enter into.
A bowne was installed to be able to attend the proposed speakers for a evening with Christmas light, attending the former South African Erzbischof, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrants is traveled with bodies and moves from the big cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, as well as some African.

Today, we are going to the streets to request a rebuilding of the environmental debt for the Southern, Lidy Nacpil, Philippines activists of Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue and say to us: We have time, Angelique Kidjo, Singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that are exhausted, water flows can be spacing, as it was never the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, based on 1992 with the delay of the United Nations Agreement, the movement of globalization critics has drawn close to the environmental organizations.
The European Commissioner José Bói, designed by the Globalisation Critical, said that he came to Kopenhagen to link "Clearity and Social Justice": "There is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific room, where many islands are particularly added to warming, has given the Demonstr starting Committee.
Approximately 50,000 people have been moved to the streets.
In Manila, there were hundreds of people, most students who were marched in red and who had shot bandanas in which you have stretched the sun energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, some hundred demonstrators found the seamarks in order to demand an energy approach against climate change.
In France, some hundreds of people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (North), in Bordeaux (Western) and in Lyon (East).
In Genf, some people gathered themselves together.
The separatist abchasy has chosen his president to claim Georgia that this is a "stream".
Abchasien chose his president on Saturday, that happened a little more than one year after Moscow recognized this pro-russian separatist Georgian region as himself, Tbilissi denunciated the "Stry".
Approximately 13,000 people were invited to participate in the first choice after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control over the South-Ossetian area, another Georgian sessionist area that was recognised by Russia.

These choices are a farse.
The Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, assured that Abchasia is now under Russian total detention, stated his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognised the self-determination of this area with 216.000 people, while the world is a part of Georgian, whereas Russia is occupied.
After Georgia had suffered during the conflict of 1992-1993, where several thousands of people died, abhassions would like to prove that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as a self-determined state, explained Svetlana Kvaroja, a 54-year historical, who claimed to have chosen for Lord Bagapch.
She was one of those who chose to choose in a choice that was in a school in the main town of Soukhoumi, a beautiful building with a few palms before the entrance.
The question of the Russian Dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscape on the Black Sea.
Great skies on which bagapch is to be seen by the Russian President and the Governing Boss, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are overall in this small area that has 216.000 inhabitants.

We, the Abchasian people, are thankful, he said at a small festival as an example of the support of Moscow, especially in relation to the decision to recognize Abchasian self-sensitivity.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, and has raised a glass Wodka.
The opposition of its side, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Propertylan Boutba, has criticized the agreements met with Moscow in the previous year, such as those in which the Russian Abchasy controlled the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to submit the current government or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one voice is needed to win the choice.
If no of the candidates reach this limit value, a second election range must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, accidents in Copenhagen
Ten thousand people have demonstrated everywhere in the world to request an ambitious and binding contract from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at the same time prepared, has established approximately 700 people at the end of an important demonstration.
Three thousand people sound the police, hundred thousands of the organizers have demonstrated in the afterday sales in the Danish capital, which receives the delegates from 193 countries on the search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.

However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, and Africans.
Nearly 3.000 people, in the heavenly blue rainmantel, formed in Copenhagen on the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group that should be represented the "Blue Sea" for "Klimage Rights".
"We are going to the street today to request that the environmental debts be returned to the people of South," said the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell us anymore: we've still got time," says the songman's Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are flowers that swim, there are water flows through which you can run, which never was the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy called in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the movement of globalization enemies has been approached to environmental protection organizations.
The French Commissioner of the European Parliament and Globalisation Critical José Bó, explained against the AFP that he had come to Kopenhagen to "bind climate justice and social justice." "The fight against warning and fighting for another world is no longer underlying."
The Oxfam organization has mobilised several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christiansen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the mass.
The Asian-Pacific space, where many islands are particularly appealed to the heat, has given the challenge for the demonstration.
The words of the organizers have passed about 50,000 people on the street.
In Manila, some hundreds of people, in the majority of students, were dressed with Bandanas before the town management of the Philippines' main city for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered together in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille, South, Lille in the North, Bordeaux in Western and Lyon in East, were organized by the "Net of 350".
In Genf, several people were gathered together.
The physician geographic and story sounds strengthened chat from the school reform of Lyceen.
The National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview that appeared in the Sunday journal "Journal du dimanche" that the Factors strengthened geography and history from the reform of Lyceen, even though they were not obliged to be learned in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have all four weeks and the same program," Mr Chatel.
For the Minister, "they must be overwhelmed, because after him "the scientific profile is no more scientific profile", but in great and total a concurrence "the best students".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) cannot be a subprofil of the scientific," he continued: "I have not yet heard many historicals and intellectuals who had been involved in the fascinating historical education in the terminals on technical liceans."
On Saturday, a IFOP request in humanity was criticised that nearly seven of Francesen (69%) the public project of the binding education in history and geographic in the terminal S (12th year of school with scientific profile).
However, the Minister replied that there is no question about the limitation of the Philosophia program of terminal S.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and workshops) were called to protest against the project, which their opinion falls to the childhood education of future teachers.
The Minister concluded that they were undertaken in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year of an approving test, in which they were examined.
▪ They conduct practices during the year in M2 and then study a year before the students as teachers in practice.
He continued: "If you all add practices offered before the performance check, you will get more hours that you have spent before the students, e.g. more than 300 hours."
The Minister explained that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "the thing that does not exist in the education".
He repeatedly confirmed that he wanted to remove the school card "to 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Normal Education"
Five minutes to talk about the use of the Copenhagen Girl: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", on Saturday morning at the University of Normal Superienes in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP stated, the peace-nobel pricemaker Jean Jouzel opened the first "Ernest" conferences, where experts return to the public five minutes with filmed contributions.
You want to undertake something to reach people and wake the feeling in them to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizations of this day, at the border of the conference. The name of this event returns to the name that the students have given to the fish in the school base.
"Below the experts were chosen about the twenty participants, even after their charism," he recalls.
"For climate warming you can speak for hours, but the nuclear goals can also be presented in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel of the AFP said, who only spoke with the help of Folie before approximately 50 people.
"This is a part of our role as economicists," he stressed in the hope that the auditors may accept that "the Copenhagen Conference is to a absolute scientific folder that is absolutely increasing."
The videos rotated by these conferences will be found online on the school page since December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and then will be placed every two months.
Payment debt : white prison wages, planned actions
On Friday, the workshops of the penalty officers have called on a general action day to achieve the transfer of the premiums and expenditures from the budget funds to January before the Wednesdays.
The second work of the criminal officers ("FO-penitentiary") requested the employees who have no service to demonstrate tomorrow before the Penalty Affairs and to block them in order to notify the "Debstle of what is happening to them".
The 3th work of the CGT-penitentiary (CGT-penitentiary) called to "unified to a strong mobilisation in the various prisons" to which the non-payment of the income, night adjudications, and the sun- and feast payments is burned in December as "comfortable and unacceptable" in October.
The first operation of criminal officers, the UFAP/UNSA autonomous criminal union (UFAP/UNSA) called to "general mobilizations... to demonstrate uncomfortableness and anger".
The management of the penalties and the Ministry of Justice claimed that the overtimes were intensely increased in 2009 and not all in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining requests were paid in January.
As the Ministerial of Justice notified the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent the offices of the criminal officers a letter to guarantee that the payment would be made in the next month.
"I know very much about the efforts of the staff to maintain and modernize our criminal systems," shares the Justice Minister in this writing.
"I have insisted on the leading of the penalty action to take immediate measures so that a situation that has occurred in the lack of a deficiency of the emergency overcome has not been repeated in the future," Mrs. Alliot-Marie added.
Thus, the payment of December is more powerful, except for the management staff that comes to high service and objective premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA for which the "containing weights" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal", the interregional FO work in Marseille, and announces to boycott all assemblies and assemblies to new instructions.
"The staff is not going to work on sun and feast days, when the hours from October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their survivals," also says FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergn.

A Roman grave plate, calculated by the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday to 1.5 million US dollars over their value, so the artist Sotheby's artist.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century to Christ and has always been evaluated by 150,000 to 250,000.
The marmor on the "four scenes of Dionysos in a sophistical architectural decoration, circumcised by satyren and bacchus figures, is a rare part. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice-President for Roman and Egyptian antiquities in Sotheby, on Sunday against the AFP.
It was broken up among hundreds of tracks.
"The purchase is still running, but this part is safely what the buyers have offered the most of them until now," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this creation of the marmor part through Emile Zola is far back.
The plate was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous assembly of the family Borghese home, and then she took a piece of piece at the French show player Cējile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Pariser hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III. French Republic and President of the Council before Marschall Pétain came to the power.
The next fifty years lie in darkness.

Zelayas outcome trial from Honduras direction Mexico has been prohibited
On Thursday, Mexico had explained the conditions for the transfer of the dismissed Honduras president Manuel Zelaya on home grounds as not more agreed after that trial was rejected by the Putsch government as unacceptable.
After a phone call with President Zelaya on the night, it seems to be aware of the possibility of implementing this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, stated.
According to the Imigration Participant, the aircraft submitted by the Mexico Government, which was entered in Salvador in the middle-week for the transfer of Mr Zelayas, was returned to the outcome site.
The Putsch government wanted Mr. Zelaya to need a "release" and requested for him in the foreign for political asylum.
However, the dismissed President refused this, since he wanted to return to Mexico as a cousin official officer.
The Putsch regime "has experienced a renewful misfortune by trying to move me to my costs..., they wanted me to dismiss," Mr. Zelaya said on Thursday against Radio Globo, where he has been reported since the beginning of the political crisis, which has been stopped in the Mediterranean country for five months.
I can stay here well and please for years, here I have my gitarrs, f ́f ́ the disrupted president, who had led to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa, under attacks of some accords.
The Mexican message has presented us a request for a road which we cannot, however, accept because it does not include a request for Asyl, has explained in the Middle-West Oscar Raul Matute, the Internal Minister of the Putsch Government, against the HRN Honduras radio.
I've been looking for no land for Asyl, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the telesur channel whose seat was in Caracas.
A possible outcome from Honduras, so he had underlined, would only be undertaken as the president of the Honduras people.
In the middle of the middle-week, the votes of Mr Zelayas had mobilised the attachments of the disrupted president, who were raised up to the Brazilian message and gathered around them, while the soldier had strengthened its use.
The Brazilian committee minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putch Government.
This, as its appreciation, shows the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had joined the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was addressed on 28 June, on the day of its organized people's preparation for his recovery, against the Council of the Master Court of Justice, the Army and the Congress.
Exil in Costa Rica was surprisingly returned on September 21, and he was insulted into the Brazilian message.
If he leaves these, he will be arrested because of the High Contracts which he is accused of by the Justice, so the Putsch government.
The President of Putsch, Roberto Micheletti, has been able to organize a presidential election on 29 November to resolve Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the conflicted election, but the Latin American countries like Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil were rejected.
Three days later, the Cogress massively voted against Mr Zelayas Back to the office until its mandate ended on 27 January.

Cuba: Hundreds of parties standing at the power of "Dames in Wiss"
Some hundreds of people who are in Cuban's power, on Thursday, have expelled the wife of political prisoners in Havanna for the purpose of the world's human rights, and also prohibited another competition, which caused a duty of dissidents to be adopted temporarily.
For the 40 ladies in Weiss, wives or nearby political prisoners, the government's parties under Raul Castro were expelled on open streets, just as they were on the Fussmarch center of the capital to request the freedom of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP visited.
"The street belongs to the revolutionary!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!", scandalized the powerful partys with high-fashioned fashion faced the dissidents.
Finally, civilians have been excorted to ensure their protection.
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in Weiss" had been played in Havanna at the previous evening, where it wasn't come to damage or arrest.
In the Havain city part of Vedado, a thousand dissidents, who also were devoted to demonstration on Thursday in view of the International Human Rights Act, were temporarily determined by civil policies, a reporter of the AFP.
The police have, according to this journalist, forced dissidents issued by the Government parties to enforce civil vehicles.
The temporary arrest of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited only to a few hours.
As a representative of the prices provided by the European Parliament in 2005 by Sakharov, the "Ladies in Weiss" have an unapproval surprise for the "bytes for the release of all political prisoners", whose number of dissidents shows about 200 persons, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a prison penalty of 20 years.
Mr. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 cuban disidents held in March 2003, from which 53 are sitting behind the grills.
The Cuban authorities are receipt of the enemies as "söldner" or "agents" in the service of the declarated enemy, the United States.
A rareness is that the Cuban TV replaced the report on the events of demonstration found on Thursday between military pro-government campaigns and the "contro-revolutionary" report.
A single party, the Communist Party, of Cuba, is ordinaryly accused of the NROs of the interruption of rights and freedoms in respect of the freedom of opinion.

The pregnant woman has become bad because of the events and should be hospitalized by a police officer according to the "schock status".
The weaponsed man, who seemed to be under alcohol or Property influence, must be developed at the street, the similar boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have lost two other passengers, obviously accidentally: a three-year-old and a forty-year-old, in which the last of the two is difficult.
The scenario remained in darkness at night.
He was weaponsed with two meat masters that he crossed behind his back, explained before Arnaud Presse, a responsible of the Syndicat Alliance of the area of Hauts-de-seine.
Several passengers, including youths, have, according to the testimony reports reported by the AFP, have tried to join the household.
I saw a guy in the triggers with a green west.
Three youths are trying to invoke.
They didn't get it because the guy was well built, he reported Alberto, a Cellner of a nearby bar.
A horde has fallen over him, including a city policeman who has broken the handheld.
Always on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two citizens, including their representative, have tried to arrest the weaponsed man and have been hurted with the meatstocks, such police information.

He was "in a state of overreachment" as "all spiritual confusions of this kind, in which the powers are released during the tattoo."
United States: Polanski's lawyer requests the status of criminal persecution
The legal lawyer of the French-Poland filmmaker Roman Polanski requested for the repeated time on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to be sentenced against his men, which is currently in Switzerland due to a seat of more than 30 years ago before the court.
Chad Hummel, the ruler's advocate of the "Pianist", made a serious process error in the second district of California at the time of negotiation in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Procedure in the second district of California.
I requested on the place of Straffort, Mr. Hummel explained before he found that the behavior of the judge Laurence Rittenband on the time of the negotiation with the case "is a cold boat running down the backs."
He said that the judge Rittenband, between the murdered, had discussed with a state lawyer who would have told him that Roman Polanski had deserved Zuchhous -- which is a grave process error.
This debate was opened in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and wished) in particular by the applicant State lawyer David Wells.
Mr. Wells had clearly explained the end of September to have the authors of the documentary film "logged".
If the Court of Justice refuses to establish the penalty procedure, Mr Hummel requests the conduct of a process that would enable him to present the evidence of his argumentation.
The complaint has also repeated the evidence already made in the first instance, i.e. that a debate on the derogation of the facts made by the complaint may not be seriously taken into consideration until Roman Polanski appears before the court.
The 76-year-old ruler was in 1978 from the United States, and even before the penalty of the penalty for "ilgal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minority.
Since this time, he hasn't been traveling to the United States.
The representative state lawyer of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, explained that Roman Polanski must be " there to attend the negotiation".
Would you like to broadcast the message in this matter, not only on (Roman Polanski) but also on other complaints that the refuge is a possibility of escape?, Mrs. Asayma asks.
Your opinion is "the filmmaker asks the court office for a pleasure and thus respects his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days of time to give their decision, even highlighted that there are other flight alternatives.
Hummel was not the only one who requested the position of criminal persecution against Roman Polanski.
Moreover, the advocate of Samantha Geimer, the victim, required the derogation of the penalty procedure.
She noticed that her client would no longer be disappointed by every restoration of the Affair Polanski Affair and added: "Nobody in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Three and thirty years are enough."
Roman Polanski was adopted in Switzerland on 26 September, on the admission of an Ananian arrest order.
After two months behind the grid, he was then condemned in the expectation of a possible delivery to the household inside Chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is burned by the growth of the chair and shut off without a course.
The New Yorker Börse ended on Friday without course, in a market which was increased between better indicators than the United States and a growth of the population: the Dow Jones wined 0.63%, the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final numbers, when closing the previous numbers, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 65.67 points at 10.471,50 points, while the europaly dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 is increased by 0.37 % (4.06 points) to 1.106,41 points.
"Really, the market is pretty hard," said Mace ́ck silver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"He remains very limited, the trade volume has become very low, and I think that this will remain until the end of the year."
The tendance was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than intended to "become to be able to improve the market view on the solidarity of the regeneration of the economy," the analysers of Charles Schwab agreed.
In the United States, the sales in separate trade increased by 1,3 % in November, therefore two months behind and far more than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of the consumers has been clearly improved in December, even though on,4 against 67.4 in the previous month, stated Index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexs were born by a new increase in the course which has reached the maximum position for the euro since two months, thus 'the appealing sectors for the economic situation', explained Owen Fitzpatrick, German Bank.
The ambiguous values have lost something on the ground.
The commitment has gone back.
The estimates of the estimate are more than 10 years in the middleweek of 3,540 % to 3,482 %, and the contribution is more than 30 years to 4,497 % to 4,492 % of the earlier.

The news of Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
The news of Johnny Hallyday are "very positive", his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at the Airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who is in the hospital for a few days.
The news are very positive.
He is very strong, it works very well, explained David Hallyday of the press when he came out of the aircraft in which he arrived shortly after 13 hours of local time (21 hours MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the song, who made a disappointed impression, assured that he would be in the hospital of Cedars Sinai, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered in Paris on Monday due to a bacterial infection after a operation in a band dishing case on 26 November.
The song was placed "This night in Los Angeles in an artistic coma to treat his strong pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service was given.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of the Cedars-Sineai hospital in Los Angeles to a artistic coma in which he was delivered on Monday due to a bacterial infection after a band-sheeper operation on 26 November in Paris.
The song had to react to a operation on the middle of the week on Thursday, due to the sick changes made by the latest intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part on Friday tomorrow at a school event in the French Gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school, set a photograph of the AFP.
The head of the Division for Ortopædic and Traumatological Chirurgie at Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, said that he would visit the song on Monday in the hospital in Los Angeles.
The product's neurochirurgen Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who has hardly operated the song on 26 November in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were explained that he made the cleanest masker.
The chirurgs of Los Angeles said that they were completely disappointed, explained Mr. Camus.
I have heard that a court procedure might be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is thinking that Johnny Hallyday "is too quick and this has been traveled with the authorisation of Paris's chirurgic chirurges to Los Angeles."
I personally phoned with this Ar, who assured me that he viewed this travel as a completely unproblematic, which had really surprised me, because I have already had two band-sheet operations behind me.
Shortly before, he learned that the song seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very in artist milie.
He had operated Marie Trintigant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, in which he practiced at this time.
2007 he also operated the spectacular charlotte Gainsbourg to resorbe a hematomic after a brain flow.
However, he is also an Ar'a with a doubtful call which has been condemned several times because of misleading operations and not to forget, because of tax interruption and disturbance.
Me Olivier Metzner, an advocate of the doctor's room, has dealt with him as "a man without scrupel" who has "regularly" to be responsible for the room and "all other than recommended".
After a few days of the weakness Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, on Friday on his advocate, Me David Koubbi, declared a claim.
This stated that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative studies would be "normal".
The operation "not called blooding and therefore requires no drainage," he added.
In any case, the tournee of the singer, whose health problems have been issued since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is clear that it is too short for a continuation of the tournee on 8 January (in Amiens), explained Mr Camus.
The UDF Party Association (France Democracy Union) will be energy and invites the Partie New Centre to not use its securities anymore.
The party agreement monitored by François Bayrou's Partie MoDem on Friday on a review of the seal, which is one of the Parties founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the President of the Party New Centre, Hervé Morin, and invited him to use this seal on no more.
Hervé Morin now announced his intention to take this UDF Sigel because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worth defending this political inheritance after he had reached the left hand.
The Minister for Defence, whose partners are the UMP, also wanted to confirm this position on Saturday before the National Council of the CN.
In view of his efforts, he received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (exempelly UMP, now in the NC), which made an advice to the property of the UDF mark, since he first requested this mark in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propiété industrial".
However, the business office of the UDF party covenant observed by François Bayrous' friends had the failure and made clear to understand that they did not allow themselves and put the Minister and the lawyer under the enforcement of a legal persecution a period, not to use this seal anymore and to overcome the rights of the mark.
In the last days, you have given a number of statements that you would propose your political movement, UDF signal +taking+, the party covenant wrote in a written writing of 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Partie MoDem, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Assembly.
They also believed that you had the right to put the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the Slogans + of today's UDF +, on their political material and on the start page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this signal, the business office of the UDF explained and requested the NC Party to "remove the name of UDF from all materials and from (your) website".
 Hervé de Charette requested to "the rights of the mark to their legal rights over their legal rights."
If you refuse this, we will raise a complaint against you to provide respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the subsequents warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF has been a complete political move since 1978 and they notice that Morin and his friends have "committed the choice" have left this 2007 to consider a competitive movement, as it had already been done in 2002 to make the Partie "UMP".
Therefore, the Partie New Centre has no rights to use the under-democracy UDF (Union for la democracy France).
They continue to note that the last congress of the UDF 2007 has dismissed the three-year approach to the Partie MoDem and the establishment of a business body to defense "the material and moral interests" of the movement based by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the business office continues, "which he at the time he requested the name of the market has not been member of the UDF since three years" but the UMP.
He benefits in scandal and disturbing ways, from the failure of the UDF acronym to do this for himself.
Furthermore, remember that this unconsciousness is the best way to transform into a penalty, and ironise the BC's areas: "There is apparent to us in the same way as in life more would have to make himself a name, instead of trying to come out of the anonymity by adhering a name, in the way you have no legal applications."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned because of weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to evaluate the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether the daughter of the Milliarden Liliane Bettencourt has used a weak moment of the eighty-years to achieve a part of its capacity.
The 62-year photograph, which is for his starfotos, shall be responsible on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the use of weaknesses before the court, a penalty which will be dealt with a maximum three-year freedom penalty and a capital penalty of EUR 375.000.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this matter, which is worth the saga of one of the richest familys of France, where mother and daughter are in the hands of the cosmeticiperium L'Oreal.
However, the 15th penalty room also organized a medical study of the 87-year-old Lilian bedcourt, which is conducted together by three doctors.
The Erbin and Main Actionary of L'Oreal have yet refused to undertake such an investigation, especially not among the conditions submitted by the Government of Nanterre.
The doctors referred to on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you give clearly whether and in which time Liliane bedcourt could have been found in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undertake these investigations.
I will talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kieman, explained after negotiation.
What the law lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, is very satisfied with the decision of the Court.
This is an excited news [...]. The advice will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which he has to slip, confirmed.
Since two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has started a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photograph and Allround artists, and has accused him to have used their mother's weakness for years to make a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or insurance policies.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always resisted to be manipulated by the photographs she looked as a long-term friend.
Although the Court had to check the validity of the claim initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyer, the lawyers of the lawyers led to a large family debt on Friday.
Thus the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called three letters sent by his client to her note (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she was missing the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt said: "Please declare my daughter that I have written to Banier for five years, one-to-two times a day.
I have never been able to talk from their marriage."
The State advocate of Nanterre is again thinking that the complainant had no right to respond, especially because a pre-much judge has rejected their request in the last days to introduce a judicial protection procedure against their mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is full of lawable, not under protection and has no predecessor.
No one has the right to act in its place," confirmed the representative of the State Agency, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to submit a sentence after the procedure for the validity of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manager-revolution or the end of the early clothes?
If nothing changes in the lead of the large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intellectuality has been able to...
Since a year, the management of large enterprises in relation to its employees said the position of the companies vis-a-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: it has been access to the staff "value" to determine the best way to relate to the consumer product of the technicians in the work.
By giving customers the marketing revolution the marketing markets in the middle of the enterprises... although the authorial trial of the customer's preferences should be re-related regularly!
Demobilization of workers can lead to death demoralization.
The suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the top of a much greater phenomenon, which is particularly touching the employees.
This democracy affects the development of all the intellectual functions of the undertaking, especially those of the F&E, which is still more determined, on those of the economic intellectuality.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economyque = Economic Intelligence) "affects all shared parties... a proactive action and a future orientated view"; it is recommended by the employees to respond completely to the authorized management instructions.
We therefore call on an exploiting revolution that would be in place to make the employees equally balanced at the middle point of the company's contributions besides the customers.
The very relevant benefits of internal opinion issues
Are the internal opinion issues, such as the questionbook that the orange has submitted to his recipients, bearing this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I don't care.
- Ton't because I could find out that the whole movement in the face of a new situation in many ways is going to do this, primarily, what it has always done.
Also because the authors - one of the pathologies of power-proportionally increases in the importance of his own misfortune.
And s · because most leader forces have a strongly simplified idea of human behaviour.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They accept the old behaviorist theory that recently reactivated by the American Neurological Sciences and uncertainly broadcast by research institutions and media.
Therefore, by suggesting that it is possible to operate the "Hebel" (sic) for the commitment of employees, a current Le Figaro.fr review of Ipsos will strengthen the forces of the Ipsos in a position to a mechanistic control system that is involving the world today.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, a operational revolution that is necessary for the use of the modern enterprises provides the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It includes integration of a basic protocol in each review or practice of control: for the recipients the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve a part of their dreams, their honor and their properties.
At the same time, the multifunctional analysis only takes this concept of the motivation of the workers.
They have shown that they evaluate their enterprises on the basis of a given doxa that allows them to evaluate what it offers to achieve their objectives.
Thanks to the efficiency and measurement of these mobilization factors, the powers of the companies can control their "social performance" and predict and replace their human resource management on the right side.
They thus create a fruitful ground that is favorable to the agreed development of a strong and efficient economic intelligence.
The talk of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama Lob from right
The Ananian rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama on Friday at the evening in Oslo and was satisfied that the peace nobel price 2009 defended the term of the "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservators who had spent the price allocation to Obama on 9 October applauded this time the Chairman's talk, the example of the former Vice-Presidency Canada in the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin.
What he said, Palin explained that the face of the right flight of the Republican Party in the United States Today day magazine and that it himself has brought the subject of a "often necessary" war in their owns.
The war is, of course, the last one I think the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who had two wars of preachers George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way to declare his decisions for nine days ago to send 300,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another enemy of Obama, Newt Gingrich, concluded the opinion that the president had done "severe work" in Oslo.
I found that the talk was really very good, and the former President of the representative house, which, in particular, recognised the reference to "the existence of the wicked in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, this talk was completely found as historical, Ginrich, who was asked in the radio sending "The Takeaway".
The current deputy, which is considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the election of 2012, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who noticed the members of the Nobel Committee that they were "not free and could not exclude a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and medium-way editor at the Washington Post, Obama held "a very `ananical talk".
In addition, he said "as a President of Ananias", when he pointed out that the Europeans live "as in a security black that they have not created themselves and they do not do much for their protection", as Gerson.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, the former United Nations bossman John Bolton, a fall of Era Bush, speaking on the National Review Online website as "language, high, and inspirationless".
On the left side of the President, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is deteriorated of how Barack Obama defends the return to the fighting forces.
If you are packing the war under the deckmantel of justice, the massmaker can just justifie the innocents, he warns.
However, the pressure of the related links remains continuing praising at the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the Nobel price was forgiven to Obama, repeated the Ana himself for a speaker like him who is for his talent, as "monumental work".
The talk in Oslo "forwards a final plan to control international decisions against conflicts, poverty and pressure", as the Californian daily period.
The New York Times is the view that Obama "proclaimed the needed discourse" and counts his speech as "deeply and likely".
Teleporter: Three Marathons for an agreement which ensures the supply of Wednesday
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the workshops of the roadband and the TLF - the only worker organisation that remained until the end - on Friday to an agreement that ends the order of strike and the severe severity of supply to Wednesday.
At the signature meeting on Friday, the State Secretary Dominique Bussereau, responsible for the transport, "congratulated the agreement launched on midweek after several negotiations weeks.
After a second negotiation night, the negotiators separated the hope of submitting the agreement quickly on the next morning.
And the three employees (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 to the end of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. the agreement was undertaken.
The conflict "the company had very much damage" and "is to protect that he would affect the festival at the end of the year," so the buseau.
The Agreement provides a loan increase of 4 % for the lowest loans (local and regional road transport) and 2,9 % for the highest loan groups (international transports).
The hour for employees with the lowest salaries is therefore increased from 8,72 euros to 9,06 euros.
"It's not very much, but we're just starting a little," so Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now stated that the provisions are not blocked anymore.
"Now there will always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The President of the TLF Philippe Grillot said of a "good agreement", although it was difficult to introduce these loan increases in view of the international competition.
It follows that the increase of 170 euros per month for the lower and 100 to 120 euros for the highly loan groups.
"This agreement is based on the healthy human understanding and respect for employees," as the Maxime Dumont (CFDT), but Thierry Douine (CFTC) said of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said about "a acceptable compromission".
The Agreement also provides for the increase of travellers by 3 % and the maintenance of the General Network for Road Transports in the first half year 2010, which will, in particular, be allowed to take place the 13 months content and the modernization of tariff contracts.
Mr. Bussereau noted that "the sinking of the taxes for employees of 100 million euro" was the object of a amendment of the Government to the draft legislation for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday night.
The Government requests a "idential" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply to the enterprises associated with this organisation and then to apply in the case of an extension by the Minister for the whole profession.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, assured busereau.
The opposition of employees can only extend the procedure.
The FNTR association claimed a "free trade" because the 100 million euros were "forwarded to the sector to compensation of a part of the carbon taxes already."
The State Secrete for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to disturb the whole egg to the next Wednesday stages, Unostra is complained.
For the band of Otre, the agreement "the small and medium-sized companies of the Branche in the coming 12 months takes a large grave."
Line RER A: Incompatible with the proposals of the RATP
The squeeves on the RER A line, the largest trail network in France for the large room of Paris and the île-de-France continued on the weekend while a meeting on Friday, the second day between the businesses and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris persons transport manager) continued to wait with their requests for payment.
At this important weekend before Wednesday, there were no moves between 10:00 and 20:00. On the center (in La Defense and Nation) was only one of two moves and outside the center line was used only one of four moves.
The connection to the SNCF moves was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which the travelers forced to overcome.
The purchased Gallery Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "you are trying to connect the great business in the wrong-technically".
The Line RER A translates the Paris Balling Space from Western to East.
The RATP stream section connects the places Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Valeée.
On Friday, approximately one of two moves was planned to the main time of traffic, and nearly no one during the travel time.
As on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the trains, since the people of the Ile-de-France had been set up on the situation.
As early on the morning, the bathroomhof of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less than others, especially because of the lack of Gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, Engineer (29), he would have been extra "in a half hours ago to come to work."
The SNCF, who had planned to maintain the travelers by employees and order forces, showed that there was no injury in the town of Saint-Lazare.
The moves running from the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Hauut arrived or passed through the Saint-Lazare bathroom to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, main assemblies of the strikeholders returned, while the results were checked that the associations after the meeting with the driving spectrum on Friday afternoon were considered as "demand".
The RER Business Leader proposed the specific development of a protocol for the RER A on all relevant aspects, times of work, professions, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (South) they ask a longer rate payment.
The CGT was convinced that the RATP himself puts its payment proposals in claims and points out that the driving spectrum "is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible for the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP claimed that a new meeting for the "complete review of work conditions" was intended for Monday.
This also shows to the associates that the company " ignores the weekend drivers".
On the morning, approximately 150 drivers suggest a committee in Paris.
Repeat, it was the driving spectacle that until the date rejected any discussion during the streek, and a meeting closed after a processing of the situation.
On Wednesday, the conflict endeavored to extend to the RER B line after an injection of Unsa and Indexants.
The associations request a payment of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, from which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Indexants), and also complain about the deterioration of the conditions of work in this range, on which millions of travelers are on road daily.
The drivers of the RER line, which have a year-based professional performance, shall include a rental of 2.200 to 2.700 euros and a payment of 600 to 650 euros for shipping services, as well as the sun and celebration.
Turkey Constitutional Court L° pro-Kurdische Party. decision with serious effects
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court gave the resolution of the Pro-Kurdic Chapter of the country; a decision followed by the unexpected demonstration in the Kurdish Community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is encouraging the government's work to strive to put the Kurdish Community in order to end the conflicts since 25 years.
The "partie for a Democratic Society" (DTP) has been resolved since it has become a "state for Aées which are negative to the independence of the State and its unity", as the Chairman of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would be taken by 11 judges, whereas a majority of seven votes would have been necessary to refrain from the resolution, and he also pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the Party, including the President Ahmet Turk and the Parliament, were excluded from the political events for five years.
In addition, the judge announced the derogation of the parliamentary immunity, Turkey and Tugluc, as well as the confiscation of the goods of the party.
The DTP is now over 21 places in Parliament (from 550).
The parties said before the sentence of the judgment that Parliament would better leave the Parliament than to take part of Parliament.
The decision followed a procedure started in 2007 by the State lawyer of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, which charged the DTP to follow the "shows" of the Working Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political creation window of the PKK revolves.
However, the Party assures the "no connection" to the PKK, refusing to defend them as a terrorist organization and calling the Government to negotiate.
The sentence of the Constitutional Court worked between the Government and the best to reach the Kurdish Community and to propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the currencies in order to allow the PKK support through the currencies and to end the conflicts.
The DTP leaders confirm that a solution to a re-extraction of spending in South-East Anatoly, where many demonstrators had led against PKK-Cheef Abdullah Öcalan to coincidence with the police in the past weeks.
Since the Court's announcement, thousands of demonstrants were gathered before the spaces of the DTP in the million town of Diyarbakir in the South East, which is mostly populated by Kurden.
The order forces included tree gas granates and water vessels when the demonstrants started to throw molotowcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the sentence of the judgment, Turkey concluded that the decision of the Court of Justice "the distortion will continue to be extended."
"The Turkey can not make this (curdish, etc.) question on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained the press.
The Government, existing from a party from the Islamic Movement, also endured the decision.
"We are opposing Prince against the closure of parties.
This is not the problem," says Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torture of the democratic opening promoted by the Government," as the Political Market Supervisor Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously react to the PKK's reaction," he added.
On Thursday, the PKK came to an attack in which seven soldiers in north of Turkey had come to life, which was one of the most brutal attacks of the past months.
Snow Incoming
An exact winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to skicane the citizens, the leader of the Winter Service of the FES says.
Especially so that his workers can test and control the entire vehicle technology.
The weekend could be the first time that meteorologists could be so far.
More than 330 workers and 120 vehicles are ready to care for snow and iron.
That is what the FES is going on in accordance with a precise plan.
As soon as it snippets in Frankfurt and the temperatures below zero degrees, 20 a-strings will be driven with large stream vehicles, reported by Brauburger.
This includes main routes and travel routes such as the new road and the land roads.
But also fire carriers, OPNV routes, footpasser zones and streets with adequate, such as the atzelberg streets.
The FES's service starts at three hours tomorrow
The approximately 1040 kilometers should be stretched in the need for a maximum of three hours with smoking salt that is better holding.
Therefore, the FES starts at three hours a night, "without the streams are free until the professional traffic begins".
It'll be difficult if it's going to snippet at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service leader, "for then no one is ready to make the stream vehicle space."
First of all, if it isn't yet cut, there are suppliers and exemptions roads, which belong to the Council's Beil Roads, in the row.
The last priority has sides and below roads.
There will be troubles, white Brauburger.
On five hours tomorrow, the FES footfolk is priorityly placed on the road, points and transitions.
For all roadways, the FES may not be able to take care of.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which mainly holds the bridges in the eye, says Brauburger.
Since it is given on this quick glass, the temperature falls under two degrees, the stream is on the road.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The wheel of the dinosaur
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other meat-free dinosauries: The two meters long and 1,50 meters of a big animal fell on two powerful bottles, had a long shadow with scarlets, bought teeth, short arms with sickcloths and a long wheat.
If the species stayed a few million years later, it wouldn't be anything.
However, Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosauriers with these body marks, Sterling Nesbitt reports of the of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then in a thick zone of the supercontinent Pangäa at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of the dinosauriers, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relatives, the spread and the characteristics of the former dinosauries.
2006 Nesbitt and other paleontologists started with a burining on the Ghost Ranch in North New Mexico.
Sometimes on one day, we have found a thousand dinosaurier bones, which is unexpected for the trias delays, reports the team-Mitglied Randall Irmis from Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones identified the researchers quickly as a new kind.
During the excavation, they brought the rest of five individuals together.
Theory on Dino Priority History
The name "Tawa" is from the sun-god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an extraordinary fund: "Dinosau-fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly you find only single bridges."
Other dinosaurier experts do not share enthusiasm unlikely.
The fund is not speculate, but he is making some theories about the history of the dinosauriers, a.k.a. Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
After the present educational opinion, the dinosauriers first took up approximately 230 million years ago.
However, the oldest fossiles are incomplete, why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is most restricted.
The experts, for example, discuss how the exes covered themselves in their three main development lines: the meat terapeuticals, which later the Tyronasaurus King, Velociraptor and also the birds, which belonged to the types of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a originating therapy.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
In the shadow of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found indications on air shakes, such as the followers of the therapeutics, the birds, and the birds.
Thanks to the aircraft, the breathing of the birds is more than those of the sugars.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the wheel column also appeared partly with air.
Tawa is the elderst and primitive therapy with aircrafts, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the big sauropodes later had also set air shocks and light building bones, the common preference of both groups had probably produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration sources to North America
Since the most primitive dynamics lived in South America, the researchers followed that the marriages were the first time.
Thus, the three development lines have already been separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which were still a single landmass for the super-continent Pangäa.
That is why the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the rest of two other, not especially associated with therapy.
The three cannot decline from a common, immigrated procedure, the researchers argument.
We believe that there were at least three migration hotels to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a companion of the Science Study.
Freely, there are also oppositions.
An older kind, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of dinosauriers, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonner Paläontolog Martin Sander.
Se ● Consideration could be a corrupt image because in South America there are simply many primitive dino-fossils remaining, while there is not something to find on other continents.
As the dinosauriers made to develop from a relatively rare side line of the reptil tribe to the governing farmers of the earthquake, it is still rare.
In the currency of Trias, the dinosauriers shared their living room with many other reptiles, for example with the practices of today's crocodile and flight saurier and with many other eases.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosauriers broadcast around the world and developed many new species, while the community died at the border of Trias to Jura.
Successful History was not forever
There are two hypotheses to declare this exchange, says Martin Sander.
It could have given a mass dead that the dinosauriers had survived accidentally, but the other reptiles were not.
Or the dinosaures were better adjusted so they could kill the competition from the field.
The success story did not always carry out.
150 million years later, a meteory incidence of a group of animals to flow, which has also been developed in the Tria, and since a shadow dazze: the sugar.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long, and the subtitles are international.
Professors of the Toronto are about that of Cambria, the Uni Wien or from Berkeley in California.
Douces from Neapel are at, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casinos of Frankfurter Goethe University offers walls worldwide.
278 Professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also high schools in all Germany, Europe and South America are solidarized with the protesting students at the West West Campus.
In one of the German and English enclosed "supported" they were the police intervention of the president.
Uni-President Werner Mämer-Estler had allowed the buildings of students and dogs in education in the past week, because walls and artworks were disrupted.
Five students were hurt.
The facts, judges the under-orders, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-related teaching events of students and teachers through a police-command".
The space represents a "not acceptable input" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exhaustive focus on vandalism serves "delegating and criminalizing of the Protest" and "le" from the contents.
The Presidency has reached the necessary discussion.
The Docs request the immediate position of criminal persecution.
The majority of the teachers have not supported the injury, it means.
Protest legitimate
In addition, the youth of the Verdi community and the German Federal Bound are solidarised with the students.
The Protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern about its own future, says Verdi-Landsman Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Ministry, Eve Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the Uni-President and the police.
We're grateful to the non-president.
Discharge and occupation are completely unacceptable funds, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the showbaden land.
We have a understanding for the Protest, but there is no understanding of vandalism, so the CDU country-day deputy Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the SPD, green and left opposition fractions were seen.
The CDU takes walls to prevent the criminalization of the protest, said Janine Wissler.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of those who are able to do it, you have been released.
The link has introduced a request which invites the Internal Minister to report the police intervention.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, she felt a secret city, inaccessible for west officials.
Selenograd, one of the regions of the capital city of Moscow, was a strictly guardian place in the Soviet Union for secret destruction research.
Today, the community applies to its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 miles away from the Moscow center, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production stations for micro- and nano-electronic are located here.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Selenograds have contacted the place of Frankfurter Employment Riedberg - with the universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Space (FIZ).
There were several mutual searches and the middle-week signed in Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a "Protocol for Enhanced Cooperation".
The Moscow Vize citizen Master Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Sünnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt Planning Dezerner Edwin Black.
2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural Scientific Fossing Point for a seminar to Selenograd.
Foreign exchange
It's a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also economic relations.
The company of the FIZ is allowed to take feet on the growing Russian market.
Environmentally, Russian economy forces want to take place missions in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of significant Russian research institutions and enterprises.
It belongs to the Moscow Institute for Electronic Technology, the large conzerne Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Electronica.
The community was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planet" for the destruction research.
Selenograd (normally translated "Grünstadt") received its name from the managed hill landscape in which the research institutions were incorporated.
Stuttgarter Bremsclotz
The size of Stuttgart 21 cannot be used enough.
For the project's benefits, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the depth of a bathroomhof, more than a monstrous building, which will be destroyed by the town of the Baby-Württemberg City for a year in a healthy building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 has come from the spirit of the 1980s.
In the middle of the town, headwaters with glasses that ended in the middle of the town were at the same time as an accidental fossil of the 19th century, which acted as a breaming block of a modern shine traffic, because it had a lot of time to pull locumotives from behind to forward.
Income, keep quick, continue walking - that's what's going on.
And therefore the headways should disappear: in Frankfurt and München.
And in Stuttgart: a travelhouse, which is about half of the trans-sheen-magistrale between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the Slogan from the "Europe's Herce".
S21 will actually come, although the visions of the 80s are not longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitionated planners have recognized that it is almost unpaid to implement the depth in the Hessian and the Bayern Great town.
However, headways have no more income and export problem since there are modern trains with train vehicles and tax cars at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now going to the ICE nearest street to Ulm.
National and Communal Policies have implemented it.
The railway is also because the risks of the largest infrastructure single project of the Republic of tax payers and not of the State officers.
City building can be justified in some ways.
There is a new city room that - you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planer - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful for the processing system.
The travel head and the trailing building are considered to be the person's traffic, which typically has been assigned to a large growth of 80 years.
There was no competition on that time.
However, it must be first to strengthen the goods traffic because the transport on the skies is significantly more environmental than per Lkw on the street.
However, the rebuilding streak is not for good movements because of the harmful increases.
More graver is that S21 is indirectly taking many other train projects.
Good six billion euros are to be proclaimed in the Swedish.
This is the official number.
Experts hold up to 15 billion for realistic.
It states that in the next year, the money will fall on other node points and refunds in the network.
In total, sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Affairs.
One of the most important is the building of a long range of 180 km through the raintal.
Since 1987, the road is built in timelupentempo.
It would be urgent to press right here on the tube.
But S21 will be acting as a bream clot.
The raintal string is to the flashhal for international goods traffic: in the middle of the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the airport court
The Government of the country has opened the country in the Wesbaden Landday whether it will be against the judgement of the Hessian Administrative Chair of Justice (VGH) to the Nighten Flight Prohibition.
The CDU/FDP coalition has ordered experts to allow more than 400 pages of the VGH legally checked, said Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written reasons on this day that the country should re-regularize the night flight prohibition in case of the construction of the Northwest aircraft in Frankfurter Airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as it is expected by the Government of the country, is not to agree with the legally proposed protection of the population from nightly aircraft.
The coalition must be decided until 4 January.
The opposite criticized this suspension and forced the representatives of the Government to determine a revision at the Federal Court of Justice in Leipzig.
SPD group chief Torsten Schopper-Gumble requested CDU and FDP to restore their promises to a night flight prohibition. Otherwise, this is to be "wordbrush".
It's damn hard if you can keep his word, the Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said to the FDP election log "We keep the word".
Minister Posch rejected the prejudice of shepherd-Gumbel, trying the country governance to come to their night flights with "righteous distortion and trick-serie".
A precise legal test needs their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure resolution, said Stefan Mämer (FDP).
As they represented the opposition, his group's statements had never been on the night flight prohibition.
U.S. Banks Return Help
The United States Great Banks of Crises disrupt their state fees.
The Bank of America returned the aid from the Banking Fund Tarp to a total of 45 billion euros (30 billion euros).
The citigroup also plans, according to a report of the US Sender CNBC, to restore the State aid.
The institutions want to deal with the restrictions imposed by the adoption of the money, including the limitation of the payment of Managerboni and the establishment of higher taxes.
The Bank of America had a good care of 19 billion money in investors.
The sum of the sum took her out of her own cash, which, inter alia, was well-handed by Sparten sales.
The Bank Boss Kenneth Lewis thanked expressly at the middle-house tax payers: the money price has helped for a very difficult time.
The house of money has increased the financial crisis with the receipt of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The citigroup also wants to get money in the capital to be free from its commitments to the State.
On Thursday, the US bank could announce a severe exhibition of its capital, reported the CNBC under vocation on circles.
A citigroup speaker didn't want to express himself.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid their help.
Quick Choice
And then everything went faster than you thought.
If two weeks after the ZDF Management Council had driven the office official Chefredactor Nikolaus Brender, the sender may present a follower.
Last night, he wanted to vote over the staff.
As a favorite, Peter Frey, leader of the ZDF Hightown Study in Berlin.
However, an operation was not - officially by the sender to prevent the procedure.
However, it should have played a role to prevent Markus Schachers from protecting the ZDF Intens, and this proposal should not be taken by the Administrative Council.
Freey, the sweet Kandidat, is supported by nine of the 14 Gremium members.
The result of the vote was not yet fixed at the end of the editing of this issue.
Two weeks ago, shadows with proposal to extend the Treaty with Nikolaus Brender for more than five years have failed in the Administrative Board.
Only seven members talked about brenders, seven voted against him. Brender's choice was a great delay for shadows, a expectable, however.
Since the majority of the Union in the Administrative Council had signed for weeks before the election that Branders would not want to work in the office.
Organised was the opposite to the Chef of the Hessian President Roland Koch.
With the argument that the ZDF message sentences would have lost to accommodation rates under fires, he refused another official period of the hothanged Chefredactor.
Soon before the choice, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was taken.
In the debate, even 35 State judges have been mixed in the case of Coch's action as a constitutional consideration.
It doesn't have anything to do.
For Person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied, phedagogics and Romanists.
Then he looked at the Southwest and the Frankfurter.
1983, Frey changed to ZDF, to "this day".
The following: 1988-1990 of the Chefdactor's personal referendum; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; to 1998 the leader and moderator of the "Mordenmagazine"; up to 2001 the leader of the ZDF foreign policy; from the leader of the ZDF-Haupt city studies.
The Green announced after the selection of Branders, which was chosen on middle-week by Branchenblad Medium Magazin to the journalists of the year, a constitutional claim.
Kochs Widerpart in the Government Council, the Rheinland-Pacific President Kurt Beck, explained the last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that personal proposals of the Intense cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, the exemption of partial policies from the CFD's observatory structures was also out of Beck.
Branders' presumptuous followers Peter Frey had recommended the Administrative Board with a wise choice - by criticizing the Gremium immediately after the brender decline.
Thanks to the journalist independence of this committee, both Schools without the loss of view could nominate him for the posts of the Chefedactor and choose the Administrative Board, without coming into the detention of bringing a party to the office.
In the partiality methics, Frey is revoked to the left liberal.
Extracting space
Consequences for students: After a year of education, the Culture Minister of the countries finally agreed on Thursday: At a meeting of the Cultural Ministry and High School Conference, both sides agreed to improve the conditions in Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to be able to help them also.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: basically, each module should be completed only with a single test.
Moreover, the labour burden of the workers will be checked and ensured "a realistic and corruptible measure".
In addition, high schools want to simplify the recognition of test services between high schools within and outside Germany.
The countries were committed to make common structural provisions for Bachelor and Master studies more flexible.
There should be no different country schemes that have been given.
Decrease tests
Since the beginning of the students' protests in June → Cultural Ministers and University Directors, the false word of the best possibleness in the mouth.
Now it was first made with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests partly drasticly: "Each module normally closes with only one test" means in a 30-paper that will be partly reordered by the authorisation of access.
The Acreditation Council President Reinhold Grimm said to be offered a "complete development of contents that affected significantly the ability."
Moreover, the "Studiability" will be "the decision-making criteria" in the building.
Modules such as contents should be "checked to check it," whether "necessary uniforms of the persons in the choice of the
Events would avoid.
The students had "appeal to get game rooms, allowing and promoting their own initiatives."
The rules for the authorisation of new, but also for the examination of existing actions are required.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, which, however, means that it takes up to 2015 until all accessions have been checked.
In general, it is responsibility for accreditation agencies undertaken by the Accreditation Council established by the countries.
The Cultural Ministers asked the countries "with pressure" in October to influence the agencies that the substance is not too large and the test regime is not too strict.
In some countries, universities and schools have already been undertaken with the Ministries of the State.
As a single country, Rheinland-Pfalz has also reported adequate funds for further development of the Bologna process.
In particular, the high schools of the Tutor programmes are to be established and strengthened by the advice, as well as the tests and foreign areas.
Country and high schools want to use → million euros.
In the beginning of 2010, the Government wants to introduce a Novelle of the High School Act to Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the conclusion of a model.
The facilities should be more flexible, also ensure the recognition of services to other high schools and facilitate access to the master.
To the end of the next year, all accessories of the country will be checked on their ability.
Government and opposition reacted on Thursday over the conditions in the country.
Besides Lob, there was also critical decisions.
The Federal Representative of the Juso High School Groups requested that the establishment of the educational policy should not be located in future by the Ministers and High Schools.
At the latest after the educational lines, the students should now be involved as "a wheel".
The future academics received support from the President of the High School Center Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Cultus Ministers with which the HRK is involved in a common reform paper.
The Education and Education (GEW) has not been enough for the Bonner decisions in total: it requests a legal request that allows each member to access a continuing master study.
In other cases, the countries must ensure that the present generation of Bachelor Students is available tomorrow with best possible terms, such as GEW representative member Andreas Keller.
The countries must clearly set more doctrines.
However, a free access to the Master was not expressed by the Ministry of Culture.
More than one footnote to Herta Mämer
Income in Germany and out there is almost no control..." says the beginning line of Lyrikers Werner Sīner's weight, in which this is the motivation of the arrival of a dissident who wins freedom, but also lost his language space.
In 1951, Werner Sõner, born in the Roman Banat, had been first to be German and English teacher in Bukarest and later as a player in a child book book, before he was transferred to Frankfurt in 1982.
Sünnner has been exhausted with various literature prices, 1993 he has held the legendary Frankfurter Poetics readings at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is leader of the Hessian literaturefor in the Mouse Turm in Frankfurt.
For a manifest extraliterary supervision, he provided the last Sunday during a meeting in München, where it was "The German Literature in Romania in the Spiegel and the level of their security attitudes".
It is evidently disappointed and disappointed by Sõner, in which he set his work as an IM for the Roman Secret Service Safety before Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Francz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Along with some of the presents, Sõner 1989 had received the German language price.
The recruitment trials would have started increasingly, first in 1971.
I am, Sörner, concluded, "as someone who has not been adequate against safeguarding trials."
The Lyriker Werner Sörner is the IM Walter.
Nearly at the same time with the Nobel price for Herta Mjumar and their unexpected literary combination with the mechanisms of dictatoral government, the literature zones, and in particular the Community of German authors from Romania, will be threatened by a case that makes aware of the depth and delay of a political system based on monitoring and discipline.
Werner Sīner is, as far as you can say, not only tapes but also victims.
In his security act, IM Walter played a role, stated after the guest Sõners of literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the IM Walter.
He had him in all the difficult points for him at that time, like Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
In the form and before this public, Sünnner's Declave was unexpected, but the knowledge of a former dissident and its cooperation with the Roman Secret Service is not completely surprising.
Germany had been a pleasant reserve for security hospitals, Herta Mämer had already written in July after she had read her own act, 914 pages.
The employees, so you can think, have been speculated and, in some cases, also knew what clear name they were forwarded behind the covered Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast with the very safe view of the stasi acts, this country is still very diffused.
A systematic closure has been interrupted and stopped in the past years.
One of the Birthler's consultants of the National Council on the Development of Security Affairs (CNSAS) was found only in 1999, but the issue of the acts was more disturbing.
Since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of acts.
The fact that the influence of ancient security members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel price for Herta Mâer, was a interview in which a former team-security head was expressed adequately over the price charger.
She's got a psychosis, you've just asked her once.
The inflammation of the power seemed to be able to express in the form of the freedom of opinion.
Of course, the case of Sīvenners, as often in relation to dismissed fault, is inevitable.
The special response of the listeners to Sīner's announcement is hoped that the continuation of this chapter is more determined than by debt and shame.
For the Geneze of Herta Mämer's work, who has taken the Nobel price last night, it is more than a footnote.
Champions League Saturation Support
It worked, as a coach, there was just a adjusted foreign service of a very good nightmare, where a sporting article manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB-Trainer Christian Gross was growing in the direction of an oral colored plastic of the equipment a fourth hour after the middle of the middle of the C class.
The man with the marking glass was driving for his foreign city.
Otherwise, he could also drive himself - Alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old was so little.
It was a pleasant night, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or just go right.
In the words of the first three days of the Switzerland committed: "Although we have reached the 8th final," it is in the Champions League, thanks to the success of UNIA Urziceni from Romania, "but we cannot let us be broken from the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the decline."
The "much more important task" is on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the king-class performance in Liga all day.
And put the weaknesses revealed after the fast three doors by Marica (5.), wood (8.) and pogrebnyak (11.).
Exemption
The 8th final of the Champions League (Hilpe 16./17. + 23./24 February/Replay 9.10. + 16./17. March) is released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant attitude of the baby follower remained conducted.
Not only by the preventive health provider, who had provided the insured Stuttgarter Profis in short time self-trust, use preparation and play freedom.
I came to the players and told them that they were to take care of their strengths, and I stopped them to be mutualer, the Sealenklempner Gress explained that so simple sounding success reception that had been timed under therapeutic Babbel but no more effect.
He deceived a certain magic, gave a babbel-beat for Jens Lehmann, "when a new impuls comes in the football, sometimes do things that you wouldn't have been able."
And Sami Khedira, who was in a weekly break after his dynamic progressed on the place to the best player, attempted to describe the founded "phenome" with the speechful "fresh wind" and the work of the new representative: "He is a man who crosses and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the present situation."
It was obviously missing under Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart is still not over the mountain, a sports representative of Horst Herdt
However, the VFB Stuttgart was especially constant.
Like Gross, players and Managers also protected the victory against a replaced and completely convicted disturbance of the Roman guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkuses at 0:4 the bad wake, Khedira had been reminded.
And the sports representation Horst Heldt suggested that a season target was achieved, but the other is still remote.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That heir at Â 40. Birthday himself after the first household since three months he was not after celebration, was at the events of the weekend, which were freshly experienced in a form of a television interview of Torhüter Jens Lehmann in the form of a television interview straight before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, the Held contradicted the hard criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown the proposal for the driving wheel and declined to change the tract on the pressure of publicizing fans.
Also that his free day has been driven after games, Lehmann is deemed to be a sign of violent sovereignty and disgusting.
Lehmann's statements were "prohibited by pure egoism," he turned back and announced consequences for the cluster.
You're not going to be friends for life anymore, two forty years.
However, they had always agreed with all others that without the processing by the draft tree team, the player and spectacularly strong imagination would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share in success", said the held and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic.
WM-Fight in weight
Hitziges Duell in Bern: Kevin Johnson World Master Vitali Klitschko has always been reprocessed with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard ones, the Ukrainian defended his weight title according to the WBC version.
The sentence of the Court of Justice was a vote.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains Box-Welt Master in weight.
The 38-year-old champion, by version of the WBC band, visited the U.S. Amer Kevin Johnson in Bern on Saturday by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the title defense after Â Comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was two times world masters of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the K.O., who everyone expected, didn't take it.
Klitschko builded his Bie's at 39 wins in 41 Profi fights, he had to be killed two times due to damage.
Deputy Johnson had to take the first delay in the 24th battle.
Before approximately 17,000 viewers in Berner Arena, the 2,02 meters of a big klitschko wanted to dictate the battle, especially with his left hand.
The eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, who had announced before the Duell the end of the Klitschko-Era, was still appealing to the fights of the world Master, so Klitschko could not decide to make his rights decided.
In total, passive Johnson made too little for a challenger and tried to come over the people.
So he operated Klitschko with words and gestures, but his shoes were only rare to meet the world master.
He was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, which with Klitschko passed over the full distance of twelve.
The challenger had provided some weapon before fighting in the Swiss capital.
He made Klitschko as a "happy zombies", which "nothing can be right."
At Wiegen, the champion then caused Johnson to shoot the sunrise from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth wins to Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained in the fourth battle after Comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of expiry, he struck the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and returned to "they" WBC garden, which he had to be delivered without war.
In this year, on his title defence, Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this battle, I just got a shot and I'm physically very good in the form, Klitschko had found the quick back in the ring.
His dream, however, remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the worldmaster of the WBO and IBF associations.
The WBA's garden, however, takes the British David Haye after he was able to decrease the 2,13 meters of the great Nicolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously rejected a planned fight against Vitali Klitschko in September.
Its promotion society is now the fight against Klitschko in London Wembleystadion.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Boss Jürgen Trittin, Guttenberg, Minister of Defense, has made a fake information on Kunduz business as liars.
SPD and Left requests a clothe from the officer.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the latest recognition of the air attack of Kunduz, the Opposition Minister Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU).
The Minister said of the death bombardement on two dance moves from September "sciently uncertainty", the Green Group Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD message "show".
It's called the landscape: he's lying.
The murder order was granted under the non-compliance with the rules of the International Protection Group for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report, which the NATO has sent to Mr Gutttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became that the attack was not only for a breakdown of the lost charger but also for the purpose of killing two Taliban leaders.
Dutch Kunduz Commander, U.S.A. Luxury attack, has been killed or hurt up to 142 people.
Green, SPD and Left requested the Saturday Bundescancer Angela Merkel (CDU) to express themselves immediately before the Bundesday and to clothe what Gutttenberg really knew about the event.
Ms. Merkel must be aware of whether the objective of the death is a part of the Afghanistan Policy of the Federal Government - and whether the Kanzle Council, the Bundeswehr and the news service have approved these new areas, Jürgen Trittin and Green-Colegin Renate Künst.
Governing speaker Ulrich Wilhelm has decided the criticism again.
The Bureau has not affected concrete units of the Federal War in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the representation of the Minister on the basis of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL information, the two Guttenbergs have informed correctly and completely about the bases of the Tanclaster attack.
Offectally it was said that they would have rejected the existence of the Nato-Barth and have provided sensitive details to the Minister.
However, in the area of the two officers, they had even mentioned the Defence Ministry on several reports, including a two-side document of the Commander Chief and a field-year report.
Included with a letter to clarify the matter, the "Frankfurt of the General Sunday Journal" reports.
He hasn't received an answer until now.
The Ministry did not express the prejudices on Saturday and refused that this would be claimed to the Committee of Research of the Bundesday, which wanted to be established in the next middle of the week.
Dreams
Some see pictures and hear voices that others don't see or hear.
Not only in psychological diseases and in the outcome, the limits between imagination and reality disappear.
As soon as it's sleeping, everything's okay.
If we lie with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must give us the most wild imaginations and fantasies.
However, whoever takes traumatic states in the west, sees and hears things that others don't see or hear, mostly in the modern west world is to be foolish or droguous, at least as special.
However, such images and voices are not only in psychical diseases or in the outcome.
The same neuronal processes, which allow us to build homes, to draw pictures or Romans, include the limits between dreams, holidays and reality.
Traumatised changed spectacular conditions can occur in the different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of a village.
Even if the exposure and effect may be distinguished, the visions of the mystery Hildegard of Bingen can be brought back to similar processes from the New Age Protection Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic incidence, psychosis and hallucinity.
Halluzine or honey imaginations occur when the equivalent of the neuronal bottles of the brain - all before dopamin, noradrenaline, serotonine and acetylcholin - is reflected and the interaction of different brain parts has been interacted.
Complicated hallucine and famous thoughts are very often raised during a skizopren psychosis.
Hardness has no power on him anymore
The association of wound and dream has been occupied with philosophy and medicals since the ancient.
Aristoteles described Halluzin; as a form of the tree in the wake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatries, founded in 1861 a "great likeness of irreseen with dreams", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was "a psychosis, with all unrighteousness, instructions, meaning of such one".
It's Herbst 2001 when Henning T. is converted into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quietschbunt.
The strength has no power over him anymore, he's weakening in the room cover.
He's looking for a tritt.
Back of him lying devils with blutrotes, deceased breasts, teeth flatting.
They follow him, catch him with hard, flaming steels, cast him against the walls, he looks on the pains of the whole body.
Audio, bad voices are thirsty from walls and radios.
He can't do it anymore, the voices that strike him and understand him.
Henning T. travels two cabs from the stereo facility, shoots them to a slider and fixes them on a cup on the cover.
He goes on a sound speaker and puts the shirts around the hill.
Shut up.
The slinge's.
This will be a teacher to you, the voices in the trumpet of the trumpet, "Go to the clinic and let you go!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first of about 20 years.
It was solved by LSD.
His diagnosis sounds shizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medicines, against depression, the many, the schâffrenie.
He learned to live with his sickness since three years he was married.
In the psychosis, I have found the worst and the deepest dilution, he says.
Trug images are cruel reality
Aproximately one of the population is sick at least once in the life of shaphrenie, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second of the most frequent disease after depression.
In a acute skizoprine psychosis, those concerned may not more distinguish between the internal and the outer world, they are made in a overrun state that can lead to Halluzin, sizes, relations or persecution.
The vote is spread - votes that command, comment or dialogue.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The concerned can no longer separate from an insignificant, the brain can no longer filter signals, which are overwhelmed by inputs.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the keys for a flow of ideas and fantasy, which deeper consciousness results.
The reality authorization in the psychosis is an entity, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Ober · the clinic for General Psychiatrie in the University Clinic Heidelberg.
The shizoprene is in the center of the event, everything has a importance on it.
At the same time, he makes a passive role, he will be, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and can't make it active.
So shizopren feels often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality synchronization is mostly not possible for them, the trailing images are cruel reality, the survey is excluded.
One time in life to have a Halluzination
Other than in the dream, says Fuchs, "but keep the sensitive and space structure of the reality that is taken into the psychosis."
The famous thoughts and hallucinations found in the reality, the promotion of experience is located in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain's capriolens, the researchers are still in front of race.
Exceptions may lead to the short loss of reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be given a genetic investment to schäferfrenie, but Twilling studies have shown that the genes are not the only intending.
Researchers determine that in the case of those concerned, the minimum brain damage occurs.
We believe that the neuronal reeffect of the brain is caused in a early stage of development by a virus disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, stated fuchs.
But there remains a rash, like the slinging of the neuronal system, which also does not manifest over many years.
In addition, environmental impacts play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a psychotic solution if the disposal is available.
In addition, hallucinity is able to solve psychoses because they are involved in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs heavy
The crazy is that psychotics suffer under their hallucination and cut your medicines to lose them, others give money for what to get, says the Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Kasten.
If trailing images are found as acceptable or unappreciated, it is often only a question of the position.
Castle has collected reports about Halluzin and traveling events for years, in the past year he has evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in our head".
Although hallucinity belongs to the typical aspects of psychosis, but also amazingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychological screening such as borderline or depression often includes diseases such as migrane, epilepsy, multiple sclerose or alzheimer and throumate.
Surprisingly, it is hallucinated under certain conditions even the brain healthy humans.
Halluzine, such a box, is set together from memory contents that are normally retained.
They occur when Hirnareale, in which sensations are being processed, are overactive or too few; if our brain is heavy or even if the stimulation fails.
● This status can be solved as brain damage or a psychosis.
But too, ray, stress, love rooms or other mental exceptions.
In younger ones, there was a third of the questionnaires to have at least once in life a Halluzination.
In Summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommers and visits the Gymnasium.
It's a very normal girl.
If there were no pictures and voices.
In the pause it may appear that a crazy boy with a long, dark hair matches it.
If he answers, the colleagues look at it surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
You're thinking that the sweet girl is for a stumbled dawn, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's wake up, she's listening and seeing this boy, just like she's listening to the girl in the bank.
She can even see his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
I'm crazy? She's sometimes asking herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other trucks are not real and gone again.
Last night the appearances are most terrifying
Often the truck images are also a burden.
When she sits in the class room, she may not be able to follow the teacher sometimes because the teacher just presents a new student in their eyes and ears, while he applies to all other, hearing and visiblely on the table of matematic comparisons.
The appearances are most terrifying nights.
If she waits in her dark room for sleeping, which is very rare and very late, she may often not distinguish whether she is wake or already dreamed, whether the images she see the breasts or girls with the bloody wounds of arms and feet, standing before her open or closed eyes.
Let me be calm, she's calling the boards.
Parents and friends don't tell them anything about what they'd be foolish.
Herbst 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She has been the Abitur in the past year and le ́ with her friend.
A year ago the Halluzin stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychological box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not foolish.
A residence is also an artwork of disturbance
If someone is socially isolated or suffers under railway, he has with great probability after a time of hallucination, says the box.
I think the brain is then busy and cares for his interview.
Sarah K., a single boy, had a little girl before other children, often played alone.
Her Halluzine began when she learned with 13 that the man she calls Dad since she can think she is not her body father.
Since the same brain areas are active in visual and acustic hallucination, which also process real inputs and sounds, it is hard to distinguish people like Sarah K. to distinguish trailing images and reality. "Each experience," says the box, "find in the brain place, the reality is there.
Halluzine is also pictures that allow the brain to rise, so they act so real."
Also nightly dream images shown boxes as a form of Halluzination.
The hallucinity of andes is not fundamentally different from those of a acute psychosis.
In contrast to shizoprenes, psychic and psychological are able to recognize their truck images as irreal.
Thus, the box advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinity also as a special ability.
Limit state between dream and hallucination
In our very conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly patologyized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chefar, of the clinic for psychiatries and psychotherapie of Florence-Nightingale diseases in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, suffering disease, but it also offers positive, creatives - the army is also an artwork of disturbance.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called uneurophid experience form, a particular form of traumatised changed guardian conscience.
Oneuroides are high complex, detailed Quasi dreams that keep the experiencer real and that he can also not distinguish from growth in the neighborhood.
The uneuroid consciousness occurs in the extreme situation of trauma or disease, for example in patients with polyradiculitis who experience a motor leaving in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, as well as by enduring, full movement incapacity, he replaces the life threatening reality by a own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, Schmidt-degenhard says.
A kind of limit state between dream and hallucination.
Since a reality situation is impossible, a world change is located, but the real situation is compared to the imagination.
A intensive form of sensation and sensation in an incomprehensive situation that allows us to make humans a personal ability to not take into nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
In addition to the Zurcher Kun Propertytoriker Peter Cornelius ́s describes his uneuroid experiences in the book "Herm Change" as the salvation of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a cardiovascular operation with the following heart transplantation has gone to journeys today, while his body is condemned on the intensive station for unmotionalness.
In a world of self-generated, visiting foreign times and places: he finds himself as a foolish, old man, at the board of a train sanator, a robot waits for his health.
In the early middle age of Adligen, he produces the output from blood.
If a Greek is cut off on the engine road in his home country, it surrounds with spital bed in the alpen's snow and mets a Korean mafio.
He goes completely on the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal travels are fundamentally different from every dream.
The dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys are overwhelming to me after years and in detail.
Increasingly and more intensive than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience spreads the Horizon of our other worldwide experiences, says the psychiater Schmidt-degenhard.
The last end shows oneuroides, psychoses, hallucinations and fuzzy, how useful our internal images of the outer reality are also in the watch.
Each change in the state of consciousness, the psychological box, can lead to a transformation of what we call reality.
A experience that can also be ambiguous.

Burda
Children should take the charge of 27 years
The new Challen Challen is a middle solution: Long-term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding will also belong to 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The Leader Hubert Burda sees his company long-term in his children's hands.
Both children have 27 years of heritage and have the firm will to enter into the company, the 69-year-old said to the SPIEGEL.
We have prepared carefully the details of it.
The question of whether they are active in the company is the first question.
In addition, the question is whether they can be able to do so.
You can't imagine 7500 employees of their children if they are not sufficiently able.
This also brings children to death and the company too.
Burda had given on Thursday that he returned from the president from January, and Paul-Bernhard calls to followers.
The 52-year-old call has been a representative member in Burda since 1999.
Once he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the company's capacity and after Jürgen's separation of death leaders also came to the direct marketing, foreign, pressure and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the transfer.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of calls also serves to overbreak "10, 15 years", as Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100% of the family, said Burda.
With a shock on the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that family enterprises are not safe before the end: "This is always the case of families who were hidden from a capital lowliness that had completely inspeculated and thought that they could rise to a very large player.
It was never my wedding.
He's gone "no world powers" like Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was springer, and I don't even want to play in the World Life with 'Time', these lakes have become too large.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in respect of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least what happened to El Corte England, which recently opened a loading business with a area of more than 1000 m2im incapacity space in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about the body management.
In the wellness area, which is in the eighth stock, there are some of the companies looking at such as Hedonai, providing for a training with Laser; Spaxion, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatment; Friseure Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness study or L'Oeutan with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that shows more than 130 different tea species through her tea house.
A relaxing massage together with your partner and having a fantastic cup on the main town, or for two hours to meet the relax area to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on your legs and then relaxing in the whirlpool or with massages and a white champagne, this is only a few of the possibilities that spaxion offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided to 12 spaces for the latest vision and body treatment and for hydrotherapy.
For example, for the qualification in the fight against cellulitis or with vibriating areas.
The Fitness Study also has this type of devices, and it is also a training treaty that takes care of the customers' training units and provides them a perfect personal training.
You are starting a training unit with the introduction of a personal password on a touch holding the devices.
Thereafter, various videos show you how you perform your training units correctly.
The leader of the fitness study assures that 15 minutes (including warmness and density) are perfect to train the body muscles.
And if you want to see the company Luis & Tachi after you have trained their body, even at the friseur salon, the company will be forgotten over a room in which treatments for recovery of hair, Gquelness and health for your hair will be offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusiveness seem to be the keys for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 p.m. to 22.00 p.m. 365 days per year.
The most different Dekoletes
Western nights are always closer, and therefore it is a chance again to copy the look of the stars and to take their firm clothes into our clothes.
The form of decolletés, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be taken into account.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen a overcome and very complicated decollete, which is only possible to abbreviate.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
The Energy Society endsa has created the "Live Office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistic for the introduction of the electrocar) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and take agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subventing, etc.
On the other hand, the project MOVELE is to be developed in order to promote the electric car and opinions and measures in the areas that are employed.
This is a trial to introduce the transport means of the future.
3 "Electric towns"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be shared in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three towns selected by the Government in the MOVELE project to clear the introduction of the electric car.
The Endsa Electricity Company has already undertaken a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generality).
With this framework Treaty, it is intended to promote the activities of research and development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These A’s are, among others, related to the energy and their ability to be eligible.
However, it is not the only initiative to participate in the endsa in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in the European standardisation groups and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT.
Zapatero sees "a Horizon of Rush" for the car sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, prophesied in the Spanish car industry, which is the gross exporter of the country, "one Horizon of the rest".
In the presentation of the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero reported once again the adoptions that the Government has brought to the support of the automobile sector during the Governing Year.
"Unless the plan for the competitiveness of the industry, we today would have a panorama of degradation and delay of some of our main production works," said the Government President.
"In order to produce this plan and the preparation of the car manufacturers, even in the future in Spain in a very competitive industrial wheel, we can add a strong Horizon for the future of this industrial wheel, which is our gross export industry," he added.
He also noted that the plan for competitiveness, the part of the total car industry plan (PIA) has provided 800 million euros for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers who have re-invested more than 3 billion euros.
The Governing Boss explained that these investments are determined for the development of new models and for modernization of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the Government's adoptions to encourage the application, in addition to the 2000E plan, applying in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Governing Boss , this plan allows the gases to reduce the average of 6 % of the renewable vehicles on the Spanish market, which leaded to a "forced growth" in the authorisations that increased in "40 %" in November.
On 200,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first exhibition of the International Classic Car Measures is made, a exhibition for Factory and Liebhaber of the Engine World.
This messe will be located in Pabellón de Cristal del Casa de Campo in Madrid from 5 to 7 February 2010.
In this case, 200 internal and foreign issuers will have their marks on an exhibition area of 200,000 square metres.

Mazda3 i-Stop: environmental sports
Mazda wants to prove that sport is compatible with the protection of the environment.
Therefore, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stop and control system of the engine, baptized on the name i-stop, a device that is available only for the 2.0 gas engine with 150 PS at the moment.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 shows its good notes on the total image.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, his challenging behavior, the mechanism, the i-stoop system...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
In the presence of the presidents, you can find that the first places offer an excellent economie and good holding.
Moreover, the game of the road is exhausted.
Moreover, when considering the unit consisting of the instrument table and the armature broad, it can be found that Mazda with a number of buttons and shields in the viewing colors is red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend is to be a future index design.
This style is partly reminding us of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without further that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, are declined from the neighborhood of the German cars, especially from the peoplescar Golf, whom everyone wants to overcome.
The train gateway of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the corresponding comfort so that four adults can be able to run with the car.
To all this, a gross and clearly formed coffee room comes.
The stop and control system is available until now only for the 2-liter benzin engine with 150 PS and a 6-moving engine.
This engine is a real genuine joy. He is struggling through his beauty, his light sounds, his powers and his small consumption.
And all those who do not run a lot of kilometres per year should take into consideration this i-stopp with the gas engine because of its grove comfort in the gain and the small consumption, even if Mazda is especially the most detailed models.
In relation to the exhaustation, the so-called Sportive model is a depreciation, since it has a significantly greater number of elements from the series.
In particular, the Assistant for Road Switch (RVM), which makes the dead angle, but also the components for the traction and stability, the speed scheme, the low-temporary internal level, the boardcomp, with a green screen, the sensors for parking, an independent climate installation, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and Audio Bluetooth, as well as the crossed 17-toll-screen.
This version also includes, as if it would not be enough for exemption, the package Premium, which contains for additional EUR 1.500, as well as additional elements, especially the learnable Bixenon Scanner and the sound system BOSE with CD loaders.
Error
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars of his class.
It is especially exciting about the materials used, because of its conduct and the condition of exemption.
In addition, those who don't leave a lot of kilometres per year can also buy the i-stoop version that is available only with a 2.0 gas engine with 150 PS.
The only negative at this model is a little high price that lies between 21.770 euros for the Luxury model and 23.270 euros for the tested model Sportive.
As contrary to this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day to the highest passenger.
A Premier with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls the red teppich of the probability of Penélope, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premium of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look like elegant and sexy more than ever.(Fotos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, disappeared for a dark "Lady" clothes.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is very limited, a device with which you can read only their emails, without a possibility to see certain attachments or to survive via the Internet.
It enjoyed his five minutes, when it chose the Time magazine to one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlike to see it on the straight, but the idea of itself is especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the artphones, Peek costs only very little and has a very favorable flatrate, for example, only the half of the price of the iPhone flatrate.
After the company has seen the success, it has brought two new devices on the market: one that only was thought for Twitter, the other with a long-term freezer for data, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six-fold price.
Fonpeek, which was presented last night at the event Le Web, is the version of this finding and therefore its version.
It has, however, the same limits as his opposite, have prepared a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, approximately 12 euros per month, includes roaming for all Europe.
Those who travel with an artphone around the world know what it means to disturb all the data to read their emails as long as you have overcome the country limits or if you are trying to find a café with WIFI (or an opportunity to connect to the phone).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is unbelievable and should have been since a long time possible.
It is true that some phone providers have already offered special contracts and prices for foreign residence, but my experience has already brought a doctor title in physics and a series of brilles to read all the small printed.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission regarding the urgent roaming tariff for all Europe remained almost always unobserved.
Outside the country, you always have to read their emails and it with right.
That a small device such as FonPeek (which it is always surprising that it is the name of the Phone, although there is no Wifi/WLAN日) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the phone providers must slowly, but safely reflect and start different options in view of how they can use their data network.
The childle is another example, in its prices, the download of books and other applications are contained in the Internet.
Without wheat and without haken.
It's a Internet capable device, and it's only one time you're paying for it, namely for buying, not for month.
And exactly this is what I also expect from FonPeek on a day, a purchasing opportunity with lifelong Internet access as the Peek already offers in the United States.
And it's not because I want to buy it.
I'm reading my emails with the phone, thank you.
I especially expect this because I think it would be a more suitable model for consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fatical color of Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the color of love of the first Lady.
Once Barack Obama was official, they appeared in a clothing and a mantel of this color and has chosen the same color again to join him in the second important moment in life: the deliveration of the peace noble price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has made very similar models in both events: avery that it was almost the same color - a glassing green -, the clothes of three parts - clothing, jackets and mantels from the same substance, and thus wearing something gross-formed or a cockpit.
It is also so much that in the first view, it appeared that the first Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the princess of Asturia and had decided to make the same clothes at more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the substance from which they are determined.
When she was introduced, she brought a clothing from spit and in Oslo a sampled seed.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shields with half-heavy depths and for the second time a different model, but gold colours.
Even the frisure was every time different: The hair were thrown up as a hairkranz at this occasion, before she was opening the hair.
75% of the famous mothers have received problems in the work because of their motherhood.
The discrimination in the work has increased in the last years, especially in the younger women who want children.
This is the result of the CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women "Freeability and Care of Women in Spain".
The investigation under 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years has no doubt: 75% of the women concerned see their care accounts for the work of their motherhood.
The Property shows that there are serious subsequences in the decision to consider a family and there are the number of children, after whether women work or not, and if they exercise what kind of profession they exercise.
Those of those who do not work other than the house, work only a half day or have a fixed work contract will be better than mothers and children.
In contrast, women move with a firm opinion, especially in the public area, the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have less children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years, with a firm opinion, receive their first child only in the average of 3.7 years after collection, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with firm opinions that have longer needed to achieve this and collect it and have made the first child much later.
Auberdem also has a gross impact on maternity, even less than the calendar for receipt," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another Propertyor that must be taken into account in the age of women in the marriage and the first child.
According to the question, the age in the date of marriage and the first child is about, each level of education.
This subsection could also be found in women the same age.
For example, women in the group were between 35 and 49 years, after they had only the primary school conclusion or education, in the average of 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
Moreover, after their education level, there is another difference between women.
As women with the main conclusion already married before their first establishment and received their first child, they make women with a middle or high school conclusion differently and seek a fixed position and then marry and then get their first child, Delgado sets.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oreal Paris has recently given a new name to the new list of new newspapers of his part: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German shower will be the image of various products of the mark and also say the general public order "Because you're worth it".
The main representative of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant games at international level, will become a more famous exhibition as before its Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope.
Before her, the latest who had been able to attend this exclusive club were Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freeda Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For men, the cosmetic pharma has only boots: Patrick Dempsey (Grey ́s Anatomy) and Matthew Fox (Chaud Game College of Evangeline in "Lost").
The distribution of prices of the British industry
The britains have a significant root in the world.
Their highest representatives - designers and models, both of yesterday and today - met the annual price delivery held in London in the Royal Court of Justice.
All of them were shot in this case.
The ex-Modell Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, selected for the best model of this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent is presented in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, images of Fernando Vicente) to the three-year-back images of writers who have joined him in literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearful genre (corchbiografie, life and work), but seeks an equivalent to the glorious heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent doesn't spare fears or lights.
Avery that this book is a skillful reader, it is also a moved request for reading and reading again.
Here's some extracts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his sides, I found that the Mediterranean is not sea, but mostly a spiritual, almost sensible tribe, just as I have always found it, without having found words: the joy in contrast to the unhealthy shickhall, the moral without fault and the innocentness without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allgoric Christ, he wrote about what he was in the blood, not in mind, had, between the incapacity and the uncertainty, with a broken poetical humor, without any sense, like the murderers who had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was joined by this woman with a patience that has suffered for three years, so in her bank, in which the emotions were associated with the pleasure of the marriage, a spiritual privilege that was in it to come to heaven on the road of the destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was issued in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach, which is one of the 8000 gipfels in the world literature, you must be able to hang down on the north wall, on the wall, where you still try to renew the best mountains."
About William Faulkner: "It was a funny curse.
Sometimes he told himself that he would be the inheritance of a good owner of the grave, and again he said that he would be the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams came from a certain grave."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the town's cry, which was thrown out from a bridge from that personality of monkeys, so that his echo to deeply stayed in the night of the 20th century in his literary way. This he made by a traveling on which he fled before himself and with a speech of full violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "Every day she kissed herself and prayed: my worshipper God, please do all that is in the power, so that I can stop to write a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On the grave these versions of Spencer are engraved: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the victor of the towns,/ the rest after the war,/ after a sad life, you find a pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her package, she always had her depression.
The husband took it with full normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spioned between the Azaleen or the birds sang in Greek.
There is no other case, where the man had so much patience and had been in a neurotician whose literary talent was still much greater than his foolishness."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do instead of trying to enter Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet mean if he didn't bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
So what did this do, except to destroy the glory of that man so that he might put himself on this potter?"
Agression Feed
My 70-year-old mother went the last week through our city part in the village of Fuenlabrada, as suddenly a group of young people from 15 to 18 years beside her and our dog, our dog is a mixing that we have taken out of the animal home and weighted just six kilo, and then they lost him two footsteps and hurt him hardly.
Our disappointment is not able to believe in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, since the spass should be in a favorable aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was, of course, carried out on the line.
This is still the survival attack that a woman who was able to spaciously received when she wanted to adjust these persons because of the case, she was even afraid of her own life, because if such a living person attacks a dog, he may also be the same with a woman, a child, a older lord or probably with any one who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a normally strict city quarter at five hours after midnight on a totally normal Sunday.
The dog has healed the whole day.
Of course, in a nearby police office, we have a big doubt of whether this will be done and to predict any prejudice from the beginning, we would just want to clarify that the fair criminals were Spain.
Our disturbance on the event has allowed us to show this case.
We can't understand what the heads of these young people need to happen that they find a pleasant attack on an unhelpful animal, on a animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't know where the education and respect have remained in respect of animals and persons.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helm
In cooperation with the Spanish Safety Station (Fesvial), the road manufacturer Michelin has called a campaign to promote helm use, especially in the younger engine railway drivers, such as both companies today.
This initiative wants to focus on the importance of heat use, since it is finally the only protective element that can prevent head losses or even death in the case of an engine railway accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is a part of its commitment to the security of the process, which "includes much more than just the design and manufacture of products that will always be more safe with each day" and continued to confirm that it is also with other actions of phedagogical and informative characteristics to draw closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign for the promotion of helm use on the engine road running under the Slogan 'To be or not to be' will be distributed in a first phase to more than 500 engine radiators to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the security of the company is "continuous concern" and just because it is always committed to be a manufacturer of river for two-road vehicles that one of its main objectives must be the development of more safe products.
The sale of small ships grows again
After almost two years, the car for small transporters finally starts to see a light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November represented a increase of 12.6% in 2008, and, more important, they are the first growth at the same time after 22 months of continuous decrease, including the numbers presented by the Manufacturer Board Anfac and the Ghanvam car trade union.
However, these good numbers are only to be decreased in time with green perspective, since the reference data are compared to November 2008, which was a particularly bad decline year with a decrease of 60 % in relation to the previous year.
However, it must be reminded that, unless the growth in the last month, the total amounts of these 11 months are still 40% under the sales of the previous business year.
Since January, a total of 95.853 vehicles have been overthrown, but there are all vehicles from which the small transporter contains: car rentals, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter layers/carriers.
Moreover, the same clouds in the sky are still the same, which take the question most in competition, since even if some of the vehicles are covered by persons, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which, in almost 100% of the cases, are purchasing the purchases with a third financing.
In this way, these restrictions, which are the results of the returned funding of the credit institutions, must be included in addition to other employees, such as the increase in the rate of unemployment or the duration of the bad economies.
In this panorama and in the subsequence of the personal power cars, the financial support has been lowly helped to buy a vehicle of Plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only determined for individuals, but also for self-determined and small enterprises have a right to buy a small transporter up to 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 output that cannot exceed 160 grams per miles per mil, but the lower sales are speaking for themselves.
Ghanvam had noticed that it was necessary from the State to take special attention to these small layers and, of course, to the industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The car trade union prophesyed for 2010 a year similar to the past, for which it was calculated by 19% with a sale outcome (a person’s power cars and a landing car).
The support for brems management in critical situations is now obligation
As the ABS anti-blocking breaming system now and as it is now using the ESP stability control, the help systems for breaming in emergency must be an obligation in the busy cars.
In fact, they have already been responsible for all newly authorised personal power cars and easily small transporters, for the remaining vehicles, a care period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The reduction of the Union is aimed at improveing the protection of fuels, but these breast systems can also help to prevent many accidents.
The task of the non-brems assistant is to carry out more pressure on breaming in the case of a critical breammanagement, which the system will be recognised based on the braking force of the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until it is closed.
According to one investigation given by the component manufacturer for bosch vehicles in order, a third of the drivers in an accident, before the composition, had no longer reached the bremspedal and the help of them had not been completely disrupted.
Up to 1.100 accidents
Nevertheless, the breaming assistance takes with maximum power into the breaming system and reduces the breaming time and thus the breaming distance that a car returns during breaming.
According to a EU area, up to 1.100 mortal accidents, in which fuels are injured, could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of non-brem assistance.
There would be even less accidents - it would be estimated that every fourth accident could be prevented by personal damage - even if the so-called intellectual nobrem systems become .
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that recognises barriers (over radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while it is already exercising a easy pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts to it, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the bremsepedal if necessary.
If the driver doesn't respond to the warning and even if the composition is inevitably, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes to maintain the damage as less as possible.
General Motors separate the plan for Opel to January
Since the opel work in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first week of April, probably on 8th, says Javier Ortega, the vehicle manufacturer shows that he needs more time to complete the opel salvation plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants to see that the side concerned already agrees to each point of the plan.
And this could be the reason that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be moved until the beginning of 2010.
Therefore, since GM, it will be assured that in the next days a decision on the sale of Saab will be taken.
It is not amazing that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the Ananian carrier so that this may make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows you to contact some new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, however, wins the option of the Netherlands Sports producer of Skyper, which has a Russian group of Converg back-decking.
If any of these buyers should come to an agreement, GM could overcome some actives to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to break Saab's end of the year, if it has not been broken up until that year, will continue to be maintained.
The tax of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
The engineers used the Boxster S as a base for the development of their latest and very tired juvels and actually made it easier for 80 kilo, which now brings only 75 kilo to the waage.
In order to create such a thing, they first declined to the automatic exhaustive deck that was replaced by a cell inch with manual operation, so that it was only 21 kilo; thanks to the gaps used in this model as the GT3 "from" again 15; by the exemption of the aircraft again 13; in addition, it was reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so they were split further 7 kilo; by the building of sports bacquet sites again 12 times and with the easily 19-tolls.
Then, by the delay of the audio system CDR-30, you have reached six kilo less and by the exchange of door attacks through grips of substances, you have reached the wounding kilo.
Although he is also available with the double-grouped PDK, the test chain was carried out with a vehicle with 6-handed hands, mainly on the smallest country travels of California, on mountain streams that actually have been very cursive.
If you are conducted, you can only give him the note free.
However, the reduction of his weight has no longer resulted in that he would no longer be so safe on the straight.
It is the opposite of the case: since a long time we have no longer tried a small and light model, but at the same time there is a feeling of gross security in the curves, even in high speed.
He is a small atlet, able to make his muscles warm at a low course in the necessary time until we give him the orders to raise, bream up and then get everything out of the Motor...
He's doing everything you're saying to him, the car does everything we're doing with his hands on the board, thanks to his binding, which is just as communicative as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a chirurg.
A motorsound for all shadow directions
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the boxster S) has been learned and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option and using a system that can change the engine sound that already came to use at the Panemra.
The accumulation facility is inappropriate, insufficient, whether out of the stage or renewable.
The Federations are strong, but not hard or unbequem.
The asphalt on the country roads on which we carried with the Boxster Spyder was already adequate, but the car was well-mastered.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do in the whole streak, and that, even though we found in some of these curves of iron in the morning green and roll splits in the morning.
Comprehensively, you can say that it's a ultra light car, a car with which you have an undescriptive driving pass, how it may be more rare and there's much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 EUR.
Tile
The song, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of Coco Coco Coco Coco and an opportunity starlet at the mode view of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same heat speed as their shoes of Chanel.
More than "Bad Girl" or "The Girl", it's a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia himself wins a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many famous players in Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 attended in the complicated fubball field of Maccabi Electra, and thus comes to the first place within his group after the gross emergence of Mirza Teletovic, who was eight triples of the best of his manship (29 in the assessment).
The Vitoria community could replace the significant accidents of Mrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a gross dose of use and team work, even though they were moved to wait until the bitter end of their victory.
The excellent matches from the perimeter with 16 evaluated triples contributed significantly to their final vengeance.
The game started with the driving of the blaurotes, which set up on the top on the display table from the beginning.
Since the first four corners of the community from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, it was already able to notice that they were coming to the game field with well-heated hands.
There were English and Teletovic, mainly responsible for the 18-20s at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was almost different, only that the family from Álava was dismissed for a internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received at his back to the community with pipes and applause, which is his house to continue to build their benefit until the pause (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to highlight as the best of his family with 13 points, even if the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter has already been noticed that this would not be the best evening of Brazilians.
Nevertheless, the game was not determined, despite the clear advantage in the pause, and the Maccabs wanted to remind the Vitorianers again that nobody won't at their game field, and thanks to the continuing to attack the "Hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini were decided to make the "Gulden" turn the ruder (50-49).
More Negatives
The team of Ivanovic, who was deceived, but everything else than dead, had to prepare a few games with travel security to get air again and suddenly came with one of them the guns of Mirza Teletovic, which with three nearly following triples and with support of English and Ribas, ensured that on the display table was shown a renewable distance of (54-67) which the guest provider could scatter with (57-67).
The Alaveses were blowned in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to leave them the victory they had deserved honestly in the first three minutes.
On the contrary, Pnini and Eidson, who are not the best of their community and are trying to return their community through three points from the line (70-77).
Yet, although splitters were placed from the place because of Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not defense himself well, and even if the Israelite retained in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aë for the first time in this season.
Damage prevented Unicaja to offer the steel
Unicaja lost a sound force in Greece against Olympiacos and the leadership in the group B of the Euroliga had to go to him, and it was known in a game that was made easy by the accidents of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially during the internal game.
The community from Malagasy had no longer vote in the peace and friendship Hall or in the gender society, which may be one of the strongest Europe and a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered games in the first quarter, the Andalusiers were able to begin dreaming. A aggressive defense and three follow-up three times, two of them through Omar Cook and one by Guillam Rubio, the guests blew with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, even though the domestic community with a internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Scortitis was made that the display table showed to their benefits in the 13st-20 minutes, the minute in which it would have come nearly on the basis of an action to the interruption between the two Americans Beverley and Williams, and why both were disqualibrated.
The Greek team began finally to become warm and his overcome on two play halfs, while the divorce of the English Joel Freeland due to a damage and the three caused mistake of Carlos Jiménez in Unicaja.
Under their players in the interior field and the Lithuanian prejudice Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their benefit in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A refrigerator was unable
The game quarter ́s out of many attacks against the community of Olympiacos, which showed himself despite his 19 losses, and it even succeeded to compare the subsequence of the game exhausted in Malaysia with 66-48 in the 27 minutes.
Unicaja tried to move over the many accidents and the distinction of the damaged shots Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disagreements for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, the Federation and the three-fold Cook and the use of Lewis returned a little hope to 66-57.
However, it was impossible because the Olympiacos, when he attacked and showed his overcome with centimeters within the corb area, was not to breathe.
The Croatian Captain Nikola Vujcic made it in the 37th minute to increase the corb difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be struck and had to fall down the flight of Olympiacos.
How much should you deserve because of his profile in Facebook?
Facebook users can now be able to learn their contents, which they should deserve due to their profiles, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search machine with most displays of immobility, stations offers and cars in Spain.
The Tool "Why Do You Deserve?" calculates the users' holders on the basis of more than 140,000 postal offers available at Trovit in Spain. The users are available in Facebook for their profession, profession, age and the city where they work.
Just after a week after the application was first available, the search machine found that the Spanish worker felt "will be paid" in the average, explains the responsibility for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press communication.
The Spanish are the worst paid by the data made by the Trovit through its search machines in Greece and France.
A British programmer receives an annual brush content of 45.226 euros and a French 31.059, rather than the 24.000 euros, which deserves a Spanish.
As a result, a Lkw-Fahrer has a yearly net content of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the less paid work in Spain is the work of a Kellner with 11.592 euro netto annually; followed by the work of a seller with 14.725 euros and the employer with 15.667 euros.
The most visited staff on the Internet in the last three months are a driver, a half-day staff and social worker.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a term for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The Chairman from the Office must leave the diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January 2010, when its mandate officially executes
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian message in the Honduras main city, visited the television translator Globo that "Mel" had to leave the message since 21 September Asyl before that date.
"He's claimed that he must go on 27 January, since his mandate is running on this day and he has to seek a new arrival."
The sender also cited the ex president, who had the intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the return of the Government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Portfirio Lobo came as victors) Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried this week to get refuge in Brazil.
This, however, dismissed the refusal of Zelayas to recognize the status of a asyl seeker who wanted to force him the "the facto" government under the president of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you!
After the lostest days since the past year, where the inflation of the activa was the pre-governmental vote on the markets, the markets returned the uncertainty, which is not wonderful, because this is their natural state, in a field where the Maker makes decisions about one of the nature of the uncertain future.
The debt applied to stabilising the markets was to compare the debt with the direct cover of assets and to allow indirect free hand of liquidity at rates that move around the zero to buy the Activa banks to cancel.
The central banks have already concluded that the direct buyers of Activa have been completed as well and, without putting their heterodox in question for liquidity, start to stretch some sand into the wheat, as the ECB has already formed with its annual increase in the next week.
Therefore, investors are doubting about the ability of the world economy to maintain the economic recovery without these herodox changes, and we are just going to be witnesses of a conversion in reducing risk premiums.
The flights of the bourses and the differences in the business boni are again, even if they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states looked forced to conscious the private risks and the state debt again.
Currently, the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred refugee place of investors, which leads to an increase in the differences of the Eurozone countries in view of Germany.
Spain was not yet affected by this episode of instability, but then the Standard & Poors came and threatened with a new review of Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not damage to bring the defensors of the moral risk to weaknesses that have reassured the world economic policy responsibles to make a consciousness of what they caused, since they had disrupted the devastating effects to which the limitation of credits to lose jobs had to be dismissed when they had to dismiss a new day of thanks.
In contrast, what is held in Dubai, it is a tribe war between the Emirates to restore the power to the emirates and the development in Greece was also previously predicted.
A government that dismiss the State debt, elections and a new government that goes on the same street.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It doesn't mean that Ecofin Hungary will save the beginning of the year from the non-reservation of their foreign payments and therefore allows a Euro Member State to not carry out its obligations anymore.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to take his citizens in the need of abnormal deficiencies in order to maintain the stability of the State money.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some extent too high, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to be anxious as long as the differences in the state debt are increased by the same speed as the company boni.
However, if the subdivisions are decreased and the Spanish continue to grow, it would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. Currently the previous indicators force a major part of the market research institutions to provide their scenarios for the recovery and correct their scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which returns to a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, does not promise any long lifetime, despite warnings.
Repeat, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish action, although it is indicated at the moment "Previsible on Road".
Associated Frames
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was first before the subcommittee of the Parliament, where in these days the debate on the energy supply of Spain is discussed in the next two years.
Following the presentation of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán of the Presse gave some points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee closed doors behind.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and more than 60 billion dollars from this date to 2030, with the prejudice that the current atmosphere is still in operation.
If this is not the case, the needed investment would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that no longer should be invested in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
Since 2020, the question will be changed and the performance should be increased.
His proposal could be addressed both on gas and carbon works with engines for the start of carbon dioxide, and, in particular, on renewable energy.
In this case, it determines that 18,000 MW are needed more, naturally by other "support energy".
Galán, who believes that the draft for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the Government, is on a line with what his undertaking requested, in no way would say something against this law, how to create incentives for the national carbon consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political issues in the fight against climate change.
See Opinion after "the long-term point is clearly placed on this direction, despite some of the individuals", as she dealt with the president of Iberdrola.
If it is like, Galan thinks that the decisions on investment should be taken now, even if these are long-term, because it will take some time to create a stable payment framework to attack them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus on → Airports
The daughter company of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss Switzerland, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flu Society Aer Lingus for the packaging service on the airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussel are some of the most important.

Acciona competites with high quality and Bouygues about its first car building
Acciona is concerned for the authorisation of its first car rental, a market where they are already represented as energy and water undertakings.
The building for which it is, is a tunnel which will cost 1.7 billion Australian → (only 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German High Title are his competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian town of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish themselves in the country as building companies and carriers.
The city manager wants to complete the building end of 2014.
After the administration of public-private cooperation (PPP has decided the English decline) to prepare the project in accordance with a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for building and murder management.
In the expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment is 1,7 billion Australian Property (1,047 billion euros), which, in the last phase, competites three consorties, especially from building companies.
The group named Transcity is indicated by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the gross building companies, while the second with sitting in Italy is one of the best specialists for deep building.
In contrast to the Team of Acciona, the Consortium of Northern Â is designed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues building group.
The consortium, which is in the stronger choice, is also called LBRJV, designed by the capital of the Australian Leighton (the daughter of the German building company, which belongs again to ­S), which also includes inhemic baulderstone (in possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Rosel, which has specialized the public building.
However, the Australian infrastructure market promises a number of building works and Implementations, has to overcome a force that applies, because only the purchasing of an internal building undertaking is accessible.
A position followed by the companies referred to in high-top or bi-finger, in the case of Asian references, and the Spanish builders must be pursued.
On this market, it has only reached access by 30% of its share in high depth, owner of the Leighton.
Millions in Active
In this geographical area, the Acciona is of greater importance for the breach, where it is already very important because of its activities as energy providers and in the dealing industry.
Under other actives, it has already been in Victoria its gross windmühling park (192 MW) and leads to the group of companies that have been assigned to build and manage the Adelaide dealing facility with a budget of 700 million.
His purpose is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies in order to obtain access to the areas of building and infrastructure.
The underground wall streak, which is promoted by the town Brisbane infrastructure office and the Northern Link (Northern Maker), has the purpose of connecting the west car rental in Toowong with the roadway in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 km through the tunnel. This is the gross degradation of the brisbane streets.
The road plan issued by the town administration is the delivery for Sunday 2010 and the start of building work in December the next year.
Even if this wall line is already to be opened for the transaction in the last months of 2014, the building work will be performed until 2016.
The tunnel was exhausted in 2005.
He has two tracks in each direction, a electronic wall system and a complex floating system.

More than 63 million for France Télécom because of the disruption of competition.
France Télécom has established a penalty of more than 63 million euros for the anti-governmental behavior in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, the phone provider has restricted the competition on a fixed network and the phone through the signature of exclusive contracts, price plans and faithful programmes for consumers at the border of the regulation.
Along with this sanction, the former French Monopol and still government companies have collected more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 because of the prevention of their competitors.
The penalty that was raised last night has been even increased, since the authority waiting for competition is the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar destructions in the past and therefore has been renewed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company’s daughter company followed the example of other phone providers and opened on the Internet a trade site for the phone.
Basicly, this site of instructions of oranges in France and the United Kingdom is active.
It must be waited until 2010, until this site is available in other countries such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning 476,4 million.
The Champions League has since 1992 developed a reception source for the Fubball clubs.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken from 476,4 million, which brings them the fifth place of the Fubball clubs, which have deserved most money in the Liga.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The Champions League of the EUFA is not only honoring itself; it is also one of the main sources of the large units.
The EUFA has distributed up to 5.362,5 million euros to the 105 memberships (12 Spanish) which participate in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 session.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The woman Club is at the place of Europe, who has deserved most money by his participation and the only one who has won the Trophee three times besides Mayland.
The official Catalogue Master and the last winner of the former European Cups 1992 is the fifth place.
The list includes Manchester United and Bayern München, two communities, which also participate in the past Champoins League.
And that, though they lost against Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only at the position of the countries who could take money by the Champions, although it has more titles than all other (five, contrary to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious opposite is explained by the complicated financial distribution procedure applied by the EUFA.
In this business year, the organization whose president Michel Platini has received 1,090 million from the Champions League.
From this money, EUFA 413,1 million for fixed payments provides: each of the 20 football clubs that participate in the qualification forward (including the Atletico de Madrid) received 2.5 million.
Moreover, those who faced a participation received 3,8 million through their flowing presence, together with the 550,000 euros for each game they play.
There is also another bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a divergence (400,000 per humanity). The clubs coming into the eighth finals receive three million; the four came into the quarter finals, 3.3 million.
The last four gets four million.
The winner deserves 9 million, rather than the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus a fubball club has at least 7,1 million and at least 31,2 million income.
Barça again deserved a victory at the supercup in August 2,5 million.
However, there are still the variable payments for the 337,8 million.
This money will be granted proportionally to the value of each television.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has four places assigned.
The master of the last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's date.
New Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9 % share in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has made details about the acquisition boat of assets that will purchase a maximum limit between 25 and 29.9% of the Sos capital.
A prosecution that does not force it on the basis of the number of actions to make a public statement (opa).
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per action, which is paid for years and with a rate of 1 % per year due to this movement.
Tonight, the socioeconomic activity concluded with 1,85 euros, therefore Nueva Rumasa evaluated 18 % under the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1,50 euros reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The boat is related to the name of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives the actors a period of 15 days to inform their interest in the sale of their actions.
CNMV assured that it was not informed of this boat, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been contacted with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the payment would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sus 254.27 million.
Sos continues to structure its business management.
In trying to stay at the border of possible purchase boats and the judges of his ex-Manager, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar gave the name of Maria Luisa Jordan as leader of the internal book check.
A decision to be the first woman who has a high post in the food undertaking.
This is a newly created post which is directly subject to the President of the Group.
This is all other than free of Polemic because the company is in a judicial battle because of the decree of the conversion of more than 230 million Sos in other societies of the family Salazar.
It is not possible to be excluded that the sos varies more capital within the next months.
In view of Salazar's credit, the ex-Brater Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) came last night before the National Assembly and assured that they had approved the division of 212 million without recognizing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exemption of Paternina
The National Börsen Commission (CNMV) approved the public claim for Federico Paternina from the Investment Society Mer last 9 October.
The supervisor explained that it had approved this claim after it had been demonstrated that the conditions were complied with the legal laws and thus the content of the stated additive, after the amendments of the last 2 December, could be considered "suficient".
CNMV also reported that this boat on the acquisition of 550.008 actors of Federico Paternina aimed at the price of 7,65 euros per action, which is 8,95 % of the company capital, which consists of 6,142.786 euros in the rates of Madrid and Bilbao.
Auberdem has yet been reported that 5.592.778 million actions have been established, which cannot be overcome until the claim is concluded and their price of Federico Paternina was established in accordance with the rightful laws.
New programmes for the use of vehicles
In these days of accidents and accidents, not only the KFZ legislation
Each day, thousands of vehicles that have been developed in an accident will be dragged into the workshops where a guest must evaluate the expensive damage and the costs for the repair.
No only accident is equal and the costs for parts and worktimes can be a long and complicated task.
The restructuring of between 200,000 and 300,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
However, it is a question of minutes with support of the latest information tools
Therefore, almost 100% of the guests use these types of systems.
The service providers and applications for the assessment of accidents and institutions collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex is part of the Group of Solera, the market leader; 80% of all views are created with its products.
The two other companies competiting on the Tool Market for Appreciation and Development of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is all other than easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the seller of Audatex, is associated with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of them provides the information in another format.
Moreover, the quantity of data to be edited will always be grew up until the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engineering have come on the market than in the past five years.
Once a new car comes on the market, the company starts working.
It is a fair task, because each of the thousand vehicles must be catabolised and entered in its price.
At the same time, each model creates a "intelligent" graph image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a very well-increased model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure is quite prompt.
If it is a less profitable car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently Audatex is 99.2% of the cars broadcast in Spain.
In the exclusive models, for example, they have information on porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the straight, it is more than 99 %.
For the implementation of documentation works and the production of databases, Audatex has been distributed over eight worldwide (Spania, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has been specialized on certain marks.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There works more than hundred technicians (usually mechanical facilities) simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they receive 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates each second day.
The development of this large information flow allows companies to use them in different ways and to provide different products.
The most common use is the use of repairs and arrangements, but there is also a tool for the administration of crash parts or for the error or operational value of a car.
The only company that reports the value of the vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this boat in Spain but in the United States.
In the review of the products offered by Audatex, you can easily provide a review of the type of support it provides to the branch experts.
This company offers different tools, where the AudaPlus product star is, a standard solution for use of accidents for the advertisers.
It includes vehicles, motor vehicles and light and hard industrial vehicles.
Aver the costs for the parts, it contains the repair periods estimated by the manufacturer or the lacking prices.
This tool will be paid after use, e.g. for each opinion.
It will be used for customers that rarely use it, maximally times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
However, each insurance company, which offers thousands of observations, negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products such as AudaVIN, you can identifie a vehicle and the equipment with which it was carried out by the mount band only by the vehicle fixing number.
