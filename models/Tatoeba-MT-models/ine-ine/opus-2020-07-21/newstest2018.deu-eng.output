München 1856: Four cards that change your cup to the city
A misunderstanding, where youths are to meet today.
A throat capelle, which is now buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small garden manages the only reason for builders.
The oldest official map of Münchens promotes stressing stories at day.
It's nervous if the land maps are not current.
That is what everyone who had to get up once because the car-navi placed a surrounding road showing a green wheel.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlases, a boat of the Geoportal Bayern of the Government of State, are all other than currently - but just so very clear.
If you compare them with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how towns and communities have changed in the district of Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flack-up that you do not recognize as such.
In the large survey cards, more detailed cards were included for cities and communities, such as substitution sheets.
These occurred according to the Bayer Measurement Administration between 1810 and 1864 and resulted in the first measurement of Bayerns.
Your employee: Napoleon.
The French military leader had been occupied by Bayern since the early 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted a review of the occupied country and gave a topographic record of Bayerns in order - naturally for military purposes.
Even if the French troops with Lunéville's peace from 9 February 1801 s日: There were today's neighbors who created the idea of a boarding Bayern card.
As a result of Max IV. Joseph continued to run the project, the "Topographic Bureau" founded and thus the Bayer Measure Management.
The München's positions table comes from 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bayer country library.
The comparison before/day is the most impressive of the country's capital.
The city has expanded himself in all directions and has grown together.
An example for this is a subsequent, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sending was 21 years after the card was created, so 1877, as Münchner city part.
Today, submitting is in the middle of the city.
The home submissions could be held in 1856 by the current planning road, which was called to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bayer builders against Austria 1705.
Where the West Park is today, there is nothing to look like fields - on the first corner: In zooming, a smaller map appears with duzening lines and numbers: manually numbered flurrrows from the so-called "support" from which the basic tax was removed.
Small parcells today have no farmers - but small gardens of the "Country in Sole".
A large green area is off north of submission.
The Theresian indication, since 1810, of October, was actually a widow and no beton wilderness in the 19th century.
On the other hand of Isar, the historical map gives an insight in the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the present area of Au-Haidhausen, the street name "em Gastig" is not only read in the area of the area of the Au-Haidhausen, but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfield Street, people were locked with an imagination.
There was 1858/59 the Münchner Circle Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lights".
Since 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Godden led the establishment of the psychiater, which is brought to the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time, for example ended the review of the so-called mistakes.
He has subjected the staff to apply violence against the insects," says Hermann Wilhelm, leader of the museum Haithausen, who has been employed for an exhibition with the staff.
For 280 patients there was a place before, it was extended to 500 places later.
Sometimes, this capacity is no longer exhausted - the reason for the building of the circles in the hair in 1905.
There is the Isar-Amper-Clinicium-East München since 2006, one of the largest psychiatries of Germany.
In the area of the former aurist, youths are now meeting in Münchner Salesianum.
The order made the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a young house with training operators.
Westly, the football place of the TSV München East is residents from the 1980s.
2015, Casa Don Bosco, the childhouse, was designed in the textonary accommodation to the original building of the Ireneanstalt, which was decreased at bomb attacks in the Second World War.
The Marine Place was in 1856 as "Haupt Place", named "Kupinger Gas".
A decisionable change was also made by the Second World War in the heart of Munchens.
In December 1944, the Alliated bombs rided many lowers in the town.
A big thing remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, Small Business Houses, and a cropscape from the Mediterranean were only at the Marienhof, where these days the processes were performed and on 5 April 2017 the Spaten Stink for the second S-Bahn staff streams.
With the shooter, the old Mountain Card can be compared to the air picture of today - and fill the lock on the Marienhof.
Civil rights group published Travel Warning for Missouri
The national unit for the promotion of colorers has made a warning for colorful people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory and racial attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advice for the Federal State Missouri, which will enter into force until 28 August 2017, requests African travelers, sugars and missourianers to take special attention on travels through the State and to give greater precaution, since a series of challenged, racially based events are recently in the entire State and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently rejected law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to win discrimination institutions, as well as the criminal persons of the State, which are unrelated to minorities, allowed the group to give the travel warning.
"They have damages of civil rights that make people.
They will be arrested because of their skin color, they will be joined or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear claims in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first warning that the organization for a state in the United States has issued.
The group quoted events such as racistic offences against black students in the Property of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no benzine anymore during the trip by the State and was kept in charge by Missouri's police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also refers to a recent report of the Office of Missouri's State Advocate General, which shows that black cars in the State are held more frequently than white.
"The recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families, friends and workers about what could be done in Missouri," Chapel said.
"The people must be ready, whether it brings cash payments or let the relatives know that they travel through the State."
In 2015, Missouri decreased 100 hatred crimes, after the latest numbers of the FBI hate crime reporting programme, which set up the State in relation to the number of such damage on the 16th range of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to deal with an undertaking for the discrimination of apartment or employment.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Ar faciena after the States had prescribed immigration laws, the local criminal prosecutors were committed to arrest people for immigration crimes, which would, according to the view of the EECLU, to further race profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have set the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Next project is elements
The fisherman Weidezaun project is a successful project and continues in the next year.
The CDU-Bundday Coordinates Peter White and Cordula Kovac have made a picture in place.
At the right-group head of the family Schwendemann, the representatives of the CDU location associated with the citizen Thomas Schneider and the two lawyers.
Markus Schwendemann granted insights in his operation in which he managed 55 hectares and 40 hectares of Wald, 40 milk boys and also many young animals and stayed in five apartments.
The "shwarzwald milk" is the alternative way of departure for the milk of his kitchen, such as the woundman.
On the table of the guests comes out of Regional.
Since he is also the BLHV president of the fisherbach, he repeated the project as "elements important".
I can't win economy on such steel areas.
The Greenland area provides a lot of work, and many things must be used with the engine.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and toophography," stressed the woundman.
2003, he has taken the older operation and managed it without chemical pf protection and donor, even if he doesn't carry out bio-building.
For citizens, Thomas Schneider was clear: "The community recognised the importance of the weather project and is glad for the Leader Promotion."
The costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare should be supported by agricultors.
It is hoped that the enhancement of the areas can be broken for a long time.
"The greatest skate we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to carry out their operation," pointed the citizen master.
The agricultors are often due to promotion in the criticism.
In 2013, 25 parts of eleven participants were included on the basis of the promotion.
The opening area is therefore 40 hectares that cannot be added to at least 2023.
From the total amount of 71 500 euros, the aid was promoted over Leader, and a fourth of the fisherbach community.
Thus, the agricultors remained 12 610 euros that had to invest in 16,2 miles.
"The great benefit is the long-life of the tongue," said the woundman.
Cordula Kovac pointed out: "You do a good job, without farmers and farmers, it doesn't happen."
Moreover, for Peter White, "The best food is produced here."
Agricultural speedline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the State support of Weidezones.
The goal is the opening of the Black Wald.
The conditions are the case of a subsidiarity covered by the LPR.
 the injection area should not be able to be driving (hypocrisy over 35 Pro >) and must be threatened by the enforcement.
For the Fisher Baker Weidezaun Project 2018, the request of eight participants with 24 parts that want to build almost 16 miles of pounds.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares, calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Isn't anything anymore?
Now the white house of Trump takes the freedom state
The most safe sign of a regime exchange is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans also appreciate this as any other - therefore the carefully installed Sarddam Husseins street in the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideals of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axt in a fast fight with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to drastic restriction of legal immigration with freedom.
To remain fair, Miller doesn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty immittors would have linched him if he had done it.
But he accepted their importance, and in particular the importance that was given to her, when the famous weight of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the fulfillment of the mind, was given his base.
As Miller Acosta, "I don't want to come here to a complete thing about history, but the freedom state is... a symbolic freedom that lights the world.
The shadow that you are concerned, which has been given later and not part of the original freedom state."
Miller is really right, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.
It's about the modern resonance to the rebellious words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a State enters not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your poverty, your arms, / your troubled mass, which seems to be free, / the poor waste of the rich costs."
There was never a time when the "learning waste" was better to see on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he cleared that these people in Trumps were not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a larger political and cultural complication: it is actually a conflict with the importance of America.
Lazarus - and their friends who were engaged in placeing their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they had a high-political action.
The culture should show the connections between the French and the Republicanism by representing women's freedom in an unused classic image presentation.
Lazarus changed this importance: In her face, the female figure is no longer abstract - she received a voice.
And she gives herself a whole other name: the mother of the Exilants.
The connection to the face with the image is a feminist coup and an increasing attack on the Nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right floor for a long time.
The big Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptizer for the coming of Trump, argumented that the state of freedom is not invited to anyone, but also a former neoconservative, which brings the flame into the nearnight world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.
It must be the factor of freedom from the United States in the world.
The fakkel shall not light the way to the United States."
Very unusual Libaugh is shot on something here.
The importance of the statute is a question of the position of acceptance.
The great fancy fact of Lazarus was to see them as they were created, weak, but hopeful men after long and often terrible travels on the cock of ships.
It is in real sense to see the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and a chance to improve their life.
Their statute speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And, of course, this is not the perspective that the Miller and Trump will ever recognize.
Their face should not light the way, but the hate that is its only source of power.
World Mastership 2017: Neil Black lo日 Scotch members of the team of British
Eilith Doyle reminds himself of a time when only two shots belonged to the team of the United Kingdom
The Executive Director of the Leichtathletic of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-country Scotch quota in the World Mastership Cade "a massive contribution to the team".
A number of Scotch athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "you have something specially developed in Scotland" and the light athletic of the United Kingdom must learn from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we'll continue it until we find it," said Black.
"I'm talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
The Scotch Athletes think there's something to do with what they've done.
British Light Athletic: It has something to do with what they have done.
And with the guy on the street.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely .
Many of the Scotch athletes are medalans, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will be attacked against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m streets, while Eilith Doyle was chosen from the master to the team captain.
"Elith is quite smart.
Your Captain's talk was incredible," says Black.
"A series of atletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The patience and the real feeling that Eilith was, of course, were wonderful."
The Commonwealth silver metal winner, which will be at its fifth world masterships at the 400-m hairs, says that it is "increasing" that 16 shots are in the British community.
Scotland’s best total number of athletes at the World Mastership was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The Mediterranean Moir leads on this way and has set five British and two → records in the past year.
It will be shared in the 1.500 m and 5.000 m woods.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another shot that should be watched after a great season that included the winning in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle reminds her first world masterships when the only other shoot in Lee McCon.
The Home Captain says that she "enormous proud" is the fact that many of her people belong not only to the team, but in some cases they will also be mixed with medalans and finally.
"The behaviour of being the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was also a great honour, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me, it makes it something very pleasant for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the shots belonging to the team.
It only shows how far we've come.
And they are here as statured atletes, Athletes, who want to rise on the podiums.
What about my speech as Captain?
Yeah, I think she went good.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home-wide mastership.
So it is really important to put on this household and benefit from that we are back in the Olympia station.
I get a second chance to go out and competite there, and it'll just be a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not check for a public office if you can't forget the unity of electors
The father of our country knew something about bad pressure.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long until the journals killed him because of all, from the internal policy to its political principles.
He switched in the criticism, sure.
But he didn't make his critics weak.
For in 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of relief can be removed - and, stupid and stupid, we will be brought to the slaughter like the sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's workers have blocked and removed the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union complained him about the beginning of this week.
The staff of the Governor rejected the complaint as free, and the online comment was full of an opposition with "No, and"?
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a republican Governor in a overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular.
He has the secondth agreement of the 50 governments of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hithead.
He has shown a firm hand in the drive of his state and strong compliance with the principles.
He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his electors and play his free head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Government - which is a public forum, which is officially used and of workers paying with public tax dollars - unnecessary and finally.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argumented that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a procession.
But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spamers or hatred people who are on-line swimming the pitches.
The post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only true people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a teacher, a teacher, and a guardian, no trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, mental and not profane.
The pharmacist quoted the Bible in post and invited Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Avocate Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked for hate crime.
"I had a comment that I was deceived that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current messages," she wrote in the comment area of the "The Post" message.
"I don't even appreciate this idea, if a number of people takes place to the same subject, then some of them will be missed by such a colleative use and not as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the Governor's employees included as "concerned spam attack" would probably be called "For" others.
The Facebook era makes it easy to draw a message by simply blocking a critical or deleting a negative comment.
It is much more cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same thing that workers were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines or to arrest demonstrators and bring to weakness.
But that's exactly what's going on digitally.
Hogan is not the first public officer that criticizes that he has taken Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is distributed by Twitter users blocked by Twitter Feed.
One of the first milensteins in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The President of the Board of Supervisor of Loudoun County hurt the first amendment, according to the US Visital judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she sent a chooser from her Facebook page.
And in Kent日ky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received an eyeuch from the LU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
At Washington's time, the time of the emergency ports had similar effects like the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters shot on his head.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People who used pseudonimes such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", write all letters to magazines that reduce Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and the ship carrier with the United States, overcome its office, as stated in the history documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project.
But he didn't bring them to weakness.
Freedom, opinion differences and talks belong to our nation.
And true lead means to accept it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in Renaissance Club
The former Europeans No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoped for home comfort in the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is the 25th issue of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led near the past year in Archerfield Links to the end, before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new exhibition site and works as tourniers in the name of the United Funder and CEO's Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he reached his glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry made a great job when he set this place.
He's an intimate defense of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great creation window for this course."
The English Eales is pleased to defend a mastership for the first time, although he has won in his 32-year-old Care both in the European Tour and in the European Challenge Tour.
"It really feels special," said the secret player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open, since it was taken from the program in the year after I won it.
To return to this part of the world is magic.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The reminders come back from the last year, and it was something good for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after 50. Birthday in this year, returned to action on home grounds.
This event will be his first Scotch event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more if you play home," Orr said, the man from Helensburg.
"You want to do it well, but you're also pulling this added pressure.
I really enjoy playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad of how it's gone."
With the Trio on the field, the former Masters Siger Ian Woosnam and the older Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are the former Champions.
Orr and the former Rider Cup Captain Sam Torrance belong to the six shots on the field that others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The income is free, the parking place costs £ 5 per car with an insect and £ 10 per car with two or more insects.
All redemptions go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Lower long cancer by passengers
In the past two years, less people have died because of passion cancer.
This is the result of the University Clinic of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in an area.
"By our bills, 167 Lung cancer cases are going back to passengers per year," said Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he took a personal view of this topic in 1994.
At that time, 400 long cancer accidents have been given in Germany for passengers per year.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home accommodations are very complex
The building work in the Villinger Street is completely and "leaving some ways in the time", as the leader of the building of Fred Heinze.
In the field of households, the situation is more complicated than thinking, since there is much hidden in the underground, which is not marked in the plans.
The vere, which always prevents the building, is a great problem for the building group of the Stumpp firm.
"The ignorance of the car vehicles before red amples and abortions is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The street is locked and only the line buses are allowed to carry out.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been employed for weeks with the work at the bridge.
"The worst days were very stretching.
But for happiness, we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cold mineral water," said Marvin Kostorz.
Army and death in Indonesian Gold Land
When Bardina Degei buys the dinner, she doesn't use herd.
They even use a top of rarely.
In its holzhaus in Enarotali, the capital city of the Panai Government in the insufficient Indonesian province Papua, the housewife usually sets a sweet cartoffle - locally as "nota" - directly in the camels.
After a half hour, the cold node will be taken and cut off with fresh, unweaked hands.
Degei is sitting on the lehmboden - she has no mobile - where she also performs its daily work, for example clothes with thick water from the nearby summer.
A egg in a dark room serves as latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned to fields.
Polygamie is usually here.
Of course, it can be late to work: most village men are unemployment, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one waits to run in the village after 17 hours," she says.
It is a rare view of the daily life in Papua, a former Netherlands colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a conflicted referendum in Indonesia, as only 1.026 elders should vote by a public exhibition before the occupation forces.
An existing movement, which took place for independence against the Netherlands government, was quickly turned against the Government of Jakarta, which subjects control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal overseers.
In 2003, the province of Papua and West Papua was divided, whereas the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the part of the island.
The travel includes a 90-minute flight from the province of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning five-hour car car with the car.
There's no public resources.
The town with approximately 19.000 inhabitants is from wood houses that are surrounded by bambus sons, and from well-blech decks converted by rose into different green tonnes.
Only a few Indonesians have made their travel here, except journalists and practically no strangers.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans glorified a god named Uga Tameee.
There were also other changes.
"We were not used to take this clothing to →," Degei said, "and dealt with their lively, hand-weeded turban, their dark hair and their light rock.
"Before we had only tables on our body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28% of people live under the poverty border and have some of the worst children's death and alphabetization rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian Goldland.
The biggest and profitable goldmine in the world, Grasberg, in the owner of the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles away from Panai, a hochland provincy in the size of New Jersey with 153.000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015, Freeport has built 3,1 billion US dollars Gold and Buffer.
Moreover, Papua over wood resources in the value of 78 billion US dollars.
However, these riches are a source of damage for the Papua that ensures that Indonesia’s powerful military keeps a strong presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military citizens and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million dollars, including up to 150,000 US dollars to one officier.
Papuanic requests for higher autonomy threaten these golden hairs and are treated freely.
According to activists, more than 500,000 papers have been killed and thousands have been managed, followed and arrested since 1969 by the Indonesian military.
In the 1970s, mass deaths in Papua Stammehochland were made in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Commission for People's Measurement.
Only in the region, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3.900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We are all loss" means in a report of the Brisbane Erzdiose from 2016, which contains the reports on the Greuels of the previous year, such as unusual instructions and folters - management and electroscopes are particularly indicated according to another report - and the brutal reduction of peaceful demonstration.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, since every week events," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened, since Papua resources bring a stream of seedlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3,5 million people in the province is critical to 83%, but the demographic development changes, since muslim economic migrations from the popular islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanesian warning cantics overflowed hahn and Gado-Gado, serves a mixed tree with earthquake.
Local people fighted to keep here.
"The migrants have started to overwhelmed the traditional market coins and vegetables more likely than the local Papua," said Abeth You, a 24-year-old Panai-inheimer, who went to the province of Jayapura to work.
"It has made the inhabited Papua - Mom [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian State President Joko Widodo, in the peoplesman as Jokowi, spoke to take place the inequalities and legal damage in Papua during his election battle 2014.
The former roomman assured 27 of the 29 areas of Papua - ́ Panai on the road to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, a little change has been, and today the inheimians feel disturbed.
"Our hearts have been broken because we voted for Jokowi 2014, with the hope that he will fulfil our hopes that the righteousness will be restored," says You.
In fact, Panii only two months after Jokowi's dedication in October.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang birthday songs before a storage fire in Enarotali, as two Indonesian soldiers on a motor road through the darkness.
The wounded kids told them that they should activate their winters.
One of the soldiers took anxiety to his sound and later returned with four soldiers, so the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking, jaging and killing the group with their wheels, said sacrifices and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers celebrated in the group of children.
A child who was 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo was so harsh that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby Government Commission was placed in fire and the things were scaled next day.
Nearly 1,000 young papua men, women and children gathered themselves at a football place before the local police station and the military order to request justice.
They brought the ceremonial jailbows and brought the Waita-tanz - running in the circle and imitating a bird song - from the Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to light stones on police and military posts.
When the vote was discouraged, a command was sent to the soldiers on an internal radio: "If the mass is more than three times of opposition, they shoot them to death," it says in a official document of TIME that has not been released the local media.
Jeremia Kayame, 56, leader of the Kego Koto virtuals of Enarotali, saw the silence and called to rest and asked the multitude to return home.
No one was listening to the vote.
"When I turned back, I was suddenly shot into my left handsheet," he said TIME on the veranda of his bullet woods.
Kayame still doesn't know who has earned, but he says that the kitchen came from the series of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overfighted, many shoes were earned," he added.
The inheimian man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, the Witness of the shooting.
"I traveled to him and investigated his body to make sure that he was," said Yohanes, who brings just a name, the TIME in dark voice.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The director of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, reporters said that his officers wanted their station only "secure" because they would be attacked.
"We must defend us if people are trying to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more hurt.
The messages about murders came to Jakarta only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks Jokowi in Jayapura maintained a suffering talk in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and sweared to get the historical disasters in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately, so it will not be done again in the future," he said.
The Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an exceptional mechanism for the introduction of historical human rights damage.
But the expressions started almost immediately.
"The most damage has occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s.
The point is that we have committed us to commit these crimes, but there are processes to be carried out," he said.
Then Wiranto made a backtrace when he spoke with TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a demand mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All things are legally regulated," he said.
Wiranto, who has accused the United Nations of "kriminality against mankind", which requested more than 1.000 death victims in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights damage in Papua have already been added to the Panai incident.
The family of the Panai victims took such anxiety with angry unbelieving.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm worried."
He says he's still in ́s years later.
"I have," he said.
"I have to be arrested by the military, have been killed."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Panai have the best to discuss the event.
He says he was killed by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"When I buried the body, the military looked for me," he said.
The shooters haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police took place in the villages in the Neighborhood of Deiyai.
With regard to a conflict between village residents and the Manager of a building pharma, who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, a person died and 17 others were hurt, including children.
The man, who was born 24-year-year-old Ravia, who was drunk when he was in a nearly located fluss, died on the way to the hospital.
Inhabitants of the village protested before the company's town office.
The police said that the villages were cutting stones on of guards who reacted to the warning.
But mystery says that the mobile brigade (indonese paramilitary police) started to shoot the multitude and killed a murder.
"We were so in Panik, we have got that there will be a race," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and was witnesses as the lost ones have been delivered quickly here, as the TIME.
"I have hidden two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parlament has called to take the shared officers to account and to remove the mobile brigade of the police from the area.
Panii was always an insult for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of sensible development strengthens the uncomfortableness of the staff of the sea, Moni, Dani and the daily living in the Green Hochland of Papua.
The "Free Papua Motion" (OPM) agreed, the rebellen arme, which claims to defend Papua's rights by attacking sporadic attacks and delays of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Panaji, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In the past years, thousands of people in Panai were arrested and willingly kept in warning under the "Secure of the National Sovereignty".
Some people never get up again.
Among the people in Papua, Panai is "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens incompatibleness.
The little trip that is crucified in Enarotali is too high for inheimic.
The bread is too outside the river.
People here build everything they eat, especially note and fruit and sheet.
The agriculture is the task of women who can be managed by four or five fields of the sweet carton.
You keep the majority of the springs for the family while the Property is overwhelmed on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rupias (75 Cents).
During the time, economic inequalities have grown between the inhabited Papua and the new migrants, which have reached in greater number since the creation of new aircrafts to Nabire aircraft.
The small workplaces in the region are usually to the better educational and well-leaving migrants.
Papua often has the capital or the necessary capacity to lead their own enterprises to competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the tribe Council of Panai.
Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua.
Furthermore, the restrictions of the reporting of international media are stressed.
In the beginning of the year, the French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of the lack of coordination with the associated institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare authorisation to film.
According to Phelim China, the co-president Asian director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis' election fight were not realized to highlight the restrictions of the reporting to promote transparency and development.
"There are new complaints for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's most insufficient regions of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusing and a black list," he said in a clay.
No pressure control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the direct neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and far-breasted damage" in Papua, the Panai shooter.
The same countries have historically seen the OPM support.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Minister Arrmanatha Nasir replied the prejudices of the group and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia still applies a democracy system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to intercept the evidence of human rights."
The people want to know that more foreign governments do this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leading of the human rights bossman Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on 4 May, the inhemic inhabitants of their weaknesses and enquired him "We want freedom", according to a source that also wants to be shared in the session, but anonymously.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua says they will probably not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are shared in the Panai shoes," says Gobai, the president of the tribe Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Panai Popular, except that it is under the continuous threat of a ruberian military, is in armed education and health services.
Gobai says that the Panai-Luutes, such as other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a "shuld" that he must pay.
"You don't need money, they just want righteousness," he says.
Despite the pressures and inquiries, the families of the Panai-schouss sacrifice made a last symbolic act of the trost: the body of a victim was buried on a territory exactly against the police and military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least they will not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with a deceived head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire takes the 'Torch' cloud shorter of Dubai for the second time
On Friday, a fire found in one of the highest villages of the world in Dubai his district and forced hundreds of residents to flee from 337 meters high, 79-score buildings.
It's the second burning that takes through the high house in only two years, which will eventually be called the Torch Tower (Fackel-Turm).
The building was evacuated, no damage was reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We have slept, and we have risen up in the alarm of fire and when the people cried.
We traveled down the steps, and it was about 10 minutes to come from the 50th etage to the bottom," said a resident who called his name as George, Ree.
Dubai civil protection auditors said that the units of fire control at 4.00 p.m. (00.00 p.m. GMT) removed the fire and coaled the building.
The Government said she worked in providing subconsciences for the employees.
The case may re-release questions about safety of materials used in external areas of households worldwide.
A study through the management of the Torch building after its burning in 2015 indicated that the largest part of the damage came from the clothing, the outer clothing for decoration or isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said she believed that the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Greenfell Turm in June could have been appealed to the quick spread of a burning system, where approximately 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best of Five
The President of the International Tennis Connection (ITF) has passed with a large Davis-Cup-Coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was supported to play Davis-Cup only on two winnings, not only by the needed two-third majority.
Although they are often very long, but they also have a very appreciated five-satz-classicians remain in the traditional request.
63.54 Pro · Member States agreed to the reform, therefore the aim of the President David Haggerty was only a little defect.
"We respect this decision, but we are convinced that our members have not adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the requests.
The proposal was not only to vote before the proposal for the final end to a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only smaller details: Thus the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the guest right in the next year in the first place.
To decrease the costs for the employees, the requirements in cases of training are facilitated, etc., and the players need to solve less of media terms before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft, find a survey
A survey under flight passengers showed that more than 20% of the objects of the control points of the US Transport Safety Safety Security of more than 6%, including the aircraft while they carry out delicately prohibited mixtures or other objects with closing.
Less than 1 Pro ́ claimed that they had discovered later that they were irritablely traveled with shots, munition or splitting.
The investigation of more than 1.000 persons, which was carried out by a Jet Charter Service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also stated that younger travelers had already lost the rules.
From the questionnaires who claimed that they were wisely trying to flee with something prohibited by the TSA were 19.7 Pro ́ Millennials compared to less than 15 Pro ́, members of the generation X.
The most common items that have been claimed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent were allowed to have knownly subjects with sounds through the safety control, while 2,2 per of the women's questions and 3,7 per of the men's questionnaires had also been reported that they would have brought to the aircraft awarely prohibited.
The company said that it had asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many deceasingly smuggling software would have brought through the aircraft security and how many would have made it clearly.
It's not surprised that people who are in the first smuggling software - scientific or uncertain - by security → were those who were most often flying.
However, the company shows that the TSA guidelines are something complicated and confusing.
People often are uncertain about what liquids they can take or how much of them.
It is therefore not surprised that the largest quantity of liquids prohibited by the TSA.
A long time the people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggleware.
Flights are allowed for internal flights, but not for international flights.
Elon Musk is not mattering: Ten thousand Tesla kids strike order
Electro-Thusandsassa Elon Musk please specify the large number of orders for his new tesla "Model 3".
In this case, he has concluded that some of the customers have already returned their independent reservation.
Besides the always triumphal numbers of conversion increases and more gigantical paragraphs, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has first translated a different, less equivalent number: which of the storages in the new mass model 3.
Musk had often performed more than 500,000 orders for the new car in the past months whose delivery just started.
Now Musk is released: From the total 518.000 orders have already been returned 63.000.
Criticals have always remarked that it is only incompatible reservations.
In a storage, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom) "Reservation payment" completely.
Currently, 455.000 of such unbinding reservations have been presented, and the museum was released in a phone conference with analysts.
The fact that the storage of up to 12% of all orders could be a problem, however, the Tesla-Cheef does not believe.
His argument: The challenge to the equivalent growth goals is not at the request, but on the production side.
In the past year, Tesla delivered 84.000 vehicles.
2018 - all models together - are 500,000, 2020 a million.
The question is obviously there.
Musk says that the bookings are currently available per day 1800.
Whoever commands a "Model 3" today, first in the second half of the year 2018 can be calculated with the delivery - if Tesla is able to carry out its neighborhoods, never in the practice tested production paths without greater interruptions with maximum loading.
Experts doubt that it is possible.
However, if there are more delays, the obligation of reservations could be to the problem of Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent uncomfortable customers from escape.
EPA-Chapter Pruitt turns back because of the delay of the rules of Obama Era to reduce emissions
On one day after he was delivered by 15 States, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environment Protection, returned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama-Era to reduce emissions and caused aircraft.
Pruitt presented the change when his Agency showed the needs of the State environmental auditors to respond more rapidly than to the current administration.
He did not recognize the complaint which was raised against his previous position in a federal court.
It is a period for the States to comply with the standards of 2015 for the land near Ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would continue the compliance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "reduction in local decisions or economic growth".
Pruitt, who was before his name by President Donald Trump State Advocate of Oklahoma, was a long time a reliable enemy of stronger environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival to Washington, Pruitt has recently passed to block or late regulations which the chemical industry and the fossile fuel industry are opposed.
The sudden environment of the middle-week is the latest legal recovery for the Pruitt regulatory Rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court in Washington decided that the EPA manager had exceeded its authority when he tried to suspend the implementation of a rule of Obama Administration, committed the oil and gas undertakings to monitor and reduce methanlecks.
In a middle-yearly published opinion, Pruitt suggested that its turnover at Ozon standards simply strengthen the preparation of the EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of modern heritage of new standards.
"Until previous administrations, the EPA has often not held the terms for implementation and then expected to be accused of activist groups and other groups, and to set the date for implementation," Pruitt said, who complained the EPA more than a thousand times in the previous work.
"We don't believe in a regulation by judicial procedures, and we take a serious period.
We also take seriously the law and authority we have."
However, the EPA's opinion stated that Pruitt would sometimes use its "compliance for lacking and all other powers that are legally available" to ensure that the rules are "based on a solid and best available information".
The Republicans in the Congress insist on a comprehensive recovery of the Ozone rules.
A draft law adopted in the last month shall late the implementation of the rules of 2015 for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted in the senate.
The New Yorker General State Advocate Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states who had committed the EPA in this week, said that the group would be able to maintain the legal pressure.
"The environment of the EPA - after our claims - is an important profit for the health and security of these 6,7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the aggregates," Sneiderman said.
In this case, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, 日, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the district of Colombia.
Earth ozone occurs when damage from cars, power works, oil raffiners, chemical devices and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The occurrence of age may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and thousands of previous deaths each year.
Representatives of the public health and the environmental jubelt over the surprising course of Pruitts.
"It's unfortunate how much pressure it's done to this reasonable step from the responsibility for the protection of the air that we receive," said Lori Ann Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue fighting the ideological cross-border of the Trump Government to offer the environmental pollutants and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: Approach of the Jubilee ́ of the mountain church is invited to the old Friedhof Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 16.30 a.m. to a serenade.
Whether his idylic situation and beautiful looks on the village is the historical St. Hilarius facility a popular place to defeat.
The sugars of the sixth benefit searades can be cleaned from this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the place has made the friends and promotors of the tumling to their offer.
Walter Martini states: "It's a unique little little."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was urged first in the Württemberg Urkunden Book: Graf Hermann of Sulz was embraced "the mountain with the existing chief church to Tumlingen and Vogtei" to the Master Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Marks Silber.
The text of the urkunde followed on the Tumling Mountain, outside the unique parking church, was also a famous court to which the church or the patronat law belonged and was not circumcised.
So there were people there.
According to the description of the town of joy in 1858, near the underground and topdorf, which are still to be recognised in the image of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the Family, the famous seeds of the village.
Old cards from the time about 1600 undermine these historical events.
The patronat law has come from the early age of the church's own right.
A lord who built a church, repaired and occupied with a pharmacist continued to be owner of this church and could also devote this own church.
This was the right to use a farmer or to propose a new bottle to the Bischof.
There were three altars in the church and two hours on the tour.
The size of the two is drawn to Wednesday 1673.
The newly created clock was then born first in 1692, but later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648) the window ships were injected and shot the locks.
The dach was unexpected.
1796 French troops stood near the church.
They set out the cancer and church halls and used them as burning wood.
The rest of the Church dropped in 1809.
By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-F ́hof also served as the last rest for the dead from listeners.
1823 the Friedhof was extended and the Hilarius shirt was cancelled.
Only the church turm was allowed.
In the New Year’s night of 1834, a storm split the church turm and the middle.
To prevent a disaster, the tour was canceled.
Only the present tourist remained witness to the 750 - year - old church history.
Today, Horst Kalllenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Shaffing Rentners" as followers of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius facility.
As agents, friends and promotors of Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade on the old Friedhof to St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is made by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium and with the words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The local president Hartmut Romann says the conclusion.
The programme starts at 16.30 p.m.
Income is from 15.30 p.m.
The Serenade will find a retreat before the Friedhof.
"Get a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the white cup over wheels to the forest," the contemporary shows the fantastic look.
The Serenade's only located at a thick weather.
The agents hope for many subtitles to obtain the historical St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumling and listener.
The friends and promotors of Tumlingen feel especially committed to the home manager, as Serenade-Organizator Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to verify the authorisation of wind droppers
"Boisheim turns back" does not see legal conditions for the building and has therefore been linked to the country Council.
The "Boisheim" unit invited Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to restore its authorisation to create planned wind power facilities in the Boisheimer network.
She's been legally successed.
The United States argues that at the date of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Network, no wind power facilities could have been approved, since at the time of four in the city limit to Swaalmtal, there was only a wind power control zone.
Inside this consolidation zone, the building and operation of wind energy equipment are fundamentally possible, but the consolidation zone will also result in an exclusion of the wind energy extent for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are to prevent the landscape of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had a few days before, by amending the plan of use of the area, a second wind power control zone in the Boisheimer network - which had not approved the district government Düsseldorf due to a form of error.
"In the lack of the planning legal condition, the authorisation scheme has been granted as before and therefore to return, and therefore," Christoph Erkens, president of "Boisheim turns back."
Current state of the things: The city Council has re-started the windkoncerning zone in the Boisheimer network before the summer pause; an approvement of the circle government remains.
Recognization: "In this case, the authorisation for the creation of wind energy equipment is legally excluded."
The circle shall confirm the income of the request.
"The corresponding writings have been entered in the fourth round since last week," explained a speaker.
The circle takes it to be able to review the matter again.
However, they are probably not to lead to the procedure.
With a choice on running procedures at the Administrative Court, the circle would not be expressed on Thursday to the argumentation of the Boisheim Association.
The NEW Re, a daughter company of the NEW, plants on a area on the Boisheimer Network the building of four per 200 meters high wind trees.
In the past year, the company in which the city of 4esen was directly assigned had concluded Pacht contracts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of large lands.
With the creation of the four wind energy facilities, the energy need of approximately 11,400 households will be covered, which corresponds to a fiveth of the energy need for all four-year households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
In the past summer, the fourth city Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power facilities in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen and a share in a wind energy facility in Übach-Palenberg in the cycle Heinsberg.
Car and tractor break together: woman stir-- in a terrible accident
A terrible disturbance accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 hours at the L 333 between Netherwall Menach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Creis).
One woman was deathly hurt.
Two other persons were easily hurt.
The countrystrate remained locked over hours.
Following police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her Pkw, in the context of the driving with her 53-year-old mother, carried L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and handlers plan "Hoimat-Shoppen" weekend
Bad Langsalzaer and people from the region will re-detect the possibilities of purchasing in the city in September.
The conference and the town manager want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to locate the inhabitants in the town.
As the President of the Conference, Christian King, announced, the "Hoimat-Shoppen" clients will have the weekly for which offers the city without the usual Super-War.
It is therefore planned to be a market with regional suppliers, similar to the week.
In addition, home companies should be presented with their training places.
Furthermore, the businesses of the town will be invited to "Middle-Nights-Shoppen".
This involves not only the inhabitants of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation, advertising posts are in the radio, a Internet video and printed beaches, which indicate the end of the action week, as Christian King.
City management and construction cooperation with the Industrial and Commercial Chamber.
This is what the conference and the town go to another stage of the "Attractive Inner City" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "active Day" for the breakfast, as well as the surrounded Sunday, interviews with all operators and producers to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the trial of parking taxes this day are part of the concept.
Moreover, customer potential should be re-completed or re-completed.
This belongs to curguests and tourists.
But many inheimians would also have lost the town inside when they were purchased from the cup.
At the end, everyone should live in the town of the town and the Uniteds, until the town's operations are devastated.
It was able to overcome a network the lathargy, which was partly broadcast, the King said in the early year.
Birgit Streich, leader of the IHK Center in Mühlhouses, shared in the "Home Shoppen" day, first five towns.
Besides Bad Langensalza, this Weimar, Sömmerda, Sanhedrin city and blackrode.
The day is to "build its importance for the value of the local trade and make it more important for the common election of our cities," as a street.
The action under the IHK Federation and with many partners also shows that every citizen with purchase behavior can influence his own direct environment.

Trump pressed after transcripted transcripts of phone call Mexico for payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and ́en were published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump asked in a phone with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border.
The U.S. Chairman's complained with him because he had already approved the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "This is what you can't say to the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise of creating a wall at the southern border of the United States, and swearing to shut Mexico for the project.
The transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and enthousiasmed an approximate exchange.
Mr. Turnbull said that a trade for the United States refugees, who were emigrated, would be "laughing", "mies" and "em" and that the existence of the trade that the Government of Obama was delivered would allow him to look like a "depp" after he had proposed a prohibition for the transmission of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unappreciated call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massaker: Activists lead racial Lynchact as a call for justice again
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of surveys in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and spread to Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, who had four black passengers and a white driver, could get the bridges, a group of white men came up with warp to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a middle-old man in a neck streeping ticket - took a long move on his cigarettes and looked at the wind protection shield.
Drin's insects were weakened in fear.
"We want this n ----r Roger!" Bruced the man.
"Hold him out of the car!"
Crying down the silence when a young black man was cut off from the carrier's seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, played on 22 July, is only a imagination.
But then, when a slinger is thrown around the hill of "Roger", almost everyone in the public is cut off very real seupers.
Since 2005, citizens returned to Moore's Ford Brie to follow the night, in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - from Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of murder.
"It is really unfair that in all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the organization of the opinion.
"It's a bullet on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congress Deputy of the State of Georgia and a long life of citizens.
For him, the opinion serves as a dramatic call for action and presents an annual memory to the Monroe Community that a crime has never been corrected.
"We want criminal persecution, we want the end, we want health, we want forgiveness, but first we need to receive justice," he said.
"We can't get to health and refreshment until we receive justice."
A court medication of 27 July 1946 provides a seal on the body of one of the victims of Moore-Ford-Linchen.
According to the FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding grafics in the Lynch process were deceived.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although the contemporary remains on free foot since years, citizens say that the double motivation for the Lynch action in the whole city was always: and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia to take their vote for the first time in the pre-elected battle in Somer.
In the same time as the choice, the black farmer Roger Malcom, a white base owner, Barnett Hester, was given to the FBI, while a battle was lower - fairly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the town's wedding was that Hester was sleeping with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she brought was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white land owner, was paid to deliver Malcom from prison as the FBI.
He was joined by Dorothy and their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey in prison.
But when they went away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bri ́, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"How it seems, it was Harrison, who prepared and ordered the murder," a FBI report is locked out.
"It is also obvious that there was a complex between the state and local criminal persecution, which was not only shared in the murderers, removed evidence and disturbed the ability of witnesses."
Brooks forms it still more pregnancy.
"It was a choice masker," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this Community: "If you let yourself register and if you vote, this will make you."
Almost a year ago Cassandra Greene has led the annual view of Moore Ford Bri ́ Lynch's death.
Its presentation is visible, attractive and is based on a kind of deep racism, which many want to believe that it does not exist in America anymore.
It's hard to look, and even more weak, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about the linch, because then we are confronted with his cruelness in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not listen to what I've been through."
The tests for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 white players - a duty white and the Family - were in a room and laughed when Greene started a well-speaking overview of the track.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-register.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member since years, but he said the role would never be easier.
"I feel worried because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to get this story in life because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other hand of the room, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried to play their lines.
The track begins with Malcom, the Hester cried and touched him, wow, he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, go away from my own!"
Rascona's going to burn the fire.
There's a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black players) is cut off in lights.
Greene laughs the soundest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still kissing.
"I just don't think the white people said a -- he's."
"But," whispered one of the other black representatives.
"You just have to get the hard R.."
And exactly there is the energy in the room, a feeling of the camera delicately replaces the unbehaviour.
Everyone is busy to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he's saying it scarce and with pressure.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repeat ends violently and quickly.
There's crying, shooting, and then silence.
A woman who dressed with a tremendous clothing is over the body of the players and carries Billie Holidays sucking lobred "Strang Fruit".
Your voice is at each second word.
There are some hundred meters behind, a group of approximately four decades viewers switch and trees from the eyes.
The public is almost equally divided between black and white.
A couple is traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the exhibition, many just come down the street.
They all have almost eight hours of pressure in Georgia when Brooks lead them on a pilgrim travel to the graves of Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the murder remains an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch death was found, the air feels spently.
When the last notes of the song appear, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspecte the body name.
Children hang on their heads, register the old blood and the silent body and flourish each other.
"You're not really dead," a little boy murms like he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the multitude - and suddenly it's over.
The sight players throw the linch shel off and remove their trees.
Bradshaw wounds Marbaugh, the man in the coat that played the member.
Nick Rascona swallows two of his fellow players and then weeps together in their arms, the emotional burden of the instruction is stuck with him.
"It's okay," one of the women claims.
"We know that this isn't in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later the public will be together with the players for dinner.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta packs over the imagination with a black couple that they just have learned.
Denise Duplinski was trying to find words which have left the instruction.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions... from people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said.
"What really does this with me, let me believe that the linch is still going," she added, "this is just the police shooter today."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof holds on table, he eats and reminds of citizens' rights.
He said he had already started planning the training in the next year.
"The idea is inspiring in a certain way, because she describes the fear of what we have, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we're not learning anything from it, then it's possible to do it again.
Whoever doesn't study his own story, who doesn't know his own story is condemned to repeat it."
"God's darkness" gave the waggerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagners' monumental work, director Frank Castorf places a bunt-frivolous inscenation before gigantical, six-style culies.
The tournament (built by Aleksandar Denic) is probably showing a shadow road neck, as well as the wall residues and debtors in Berlin, a "plaste and Elaste" log from DDR-times or the New Yorker Bourses.
Before this, a open Mercedes Old Time is parking in which the daughters are placed as Rockergirls, or a alternative of Isetta.
Stapeled oilfitters remind Castorfs Guitmotive - money, power and gier - which goes through his "Ring" inscenation.
The three neighbors - sing by Stephanie Houtzel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Ste日 - harmonize as well as in the "Rheingold".
Kess they transport Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), cast a body in Hollywood Manier and give the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sing the beautiful flight garden that the Aura is around a weight boxer.
Brutal's scenes when he's getting a severe freedom.
Later, Gunther (Marcus Eiche) must also believe.
The public thanks to the enemy with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Winke and Directive Janowski are stumbled, which forms the hands to the label road.
There is a big incident for the festival orchard, which is first shown on the top - face of the great hit again in a military free time clothing.
Expansion was expected by Frank Castorf and Family Team.
If he had to have made a more worthful petrol concert in 2013, there was five years later a big jubel in which the assembled "Buh" roofs were undergone.
Katharina Wagner's office may have enjoyed it.
"Man notices that the public has been grown together with the "Ring" in a certain way," she said shortly before the introduction of the dpa.
The public has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it is also a understanding for its view.
I'm going to make a positive summary.
Max Quantge 日 as volunteer
They work in their voluntary year at several places.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the mobbers, once in the week I'm helping here in Greven in the mobberry.
And I've already been at school all day open.
How are your experiences?
A lot: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with youths, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old, so a late volunteer.
How's this going?
A lot: I've made an abort.
And then a building study, let's say, cancelled.
I realized for me that it is the fake for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked me what you're doing.
Make a social year, there's an insight, you can see how it is before the place, in the focal point, maybe it's really.
And that was what?
A lot: I collected great inputs.
I'm going to start my halt in the wintersemester.
I'm gonna study dual, probably make a social worker training and students in Hamm at the school.
Is it not unusual to have several different types of application during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it's very variable.
I think it's always going to do where to be FSJ.
You can do it from old home to youth work - in all possible factors of social work.
It was very divorced with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so afternoon.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that hurted me.
I could recognize my own forces and see how it really happens.
Other than in the building study?
Many: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
There are always other people who have a whole other story behind themselves.
Whether a refugee, or a youth who has been removed from the family, must always be individual.
Very interesting.
And you haven't had any treasure?
That's why I'm not the guy.
It's a area that exists a lot.
Property Love, a lot of friendship.
There are even negative moments, but it's the same life.
Pearson shorts more 3.000 jobs and shorts the divisions to restore the business
The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday, it will build more 3.000 workshops and shorter their interdependents by 72%, since another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is confronted.
The office destruction, announced by General Director John Fallon for the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, comes to its previous restructuring, where 4000 posts were already lost.
In May, Pearson announced a plan for extra 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to restore a business found by the fast step to digital learning.
The company who had granted his share in Penguin Random House in the past month to the Bertelsmann partner said that the view of the business year was unchanged after it had achieved a growth of 1 per cent in the first half year to 2,05 billion pounds.
Convoi attack by Kabul: Nato-Sold killed in self-mortality
A self-smorder attacked a military convoi in the Afghanistan capital Kabul, killed a soldier of Nato and several other crimes, says the officer.
Five soldiers and a dolmetscher were hurt, shared a clothing of the Nato.
Unrecognized local reports have also died in the case of three civilians in the city of Qaraabagh.
The bombing is the last violence attack that Afghanistan met this month - on Thursday more than 30 people were killed in a moschee in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide server killed two people near the Iraqic message in Kabul.
In a opinion of Nato, the explosion has occurred at the Thursday when a common patrol with the Afghanistan Army has been attacked by a "improvised stage of persons".
The statement states that all losers are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. Military Crank House on the Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group that is as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qaraabagh· is a great concern for the NATO groups in the nearby bagram.
In the first half year 2017, in Afghanistan, there were at least 1.662 civil death victims in Afghanistan, which were about 20 % in the main city.
The end of July killed a self-mortal bomb at least 30 people in a mainly skitical district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had done this attack.
On 31 May, a violent bombarding in the city center killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack of the country since 2001 the United States-drivers disturbed the Taliban from the power.
The violence underlines the rare security sets in Afghanistan, since the US President Donald Trump rejects the number of US groups, military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in the last weeks, the self-mord deputy in Kabul also caused a crisis of public confidence in the Government, and in particular by President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA turns the decision on the delay of the rules and rules to claims
The United States Environment Protector has decided to suspend the regulation of Obama's Government, which is committed by the States to introduce the emissions caused by the Agency, which occurred a day after 15 States complained the Agency for the step.
The EPA announced lately, in the middle-week, the decision to introduce the "Ozone Times 2015" and said she showed the commitment of the Agency to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue and that we react to our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a cloud.
In June, Pruitt announced the view of the EPA that the ozone deteriorations - in which part of the country would have to be an emission of damage in order to determine where incidences should be made to comply with more strenger air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 most democratic states, together with the Cookie's territory, claimed on Thursday and said that the effort was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has attempted to return a wide range of environmental arrangements, which the former President Barack Obama has raised as part of a larger agenda, which means that Trump is to encourage the economic growth.
However, the efforts have made the decline of democracy and natural protection groups, which are concerned about the impact of increased emissions on the public health.
The EPA website says that the air-inspiration containing the ozon contains "reduce the lung function and can enhance the respiratory symptoms" such as as astma.
Communitated will Community space
At the end, the decision was clear: In two votes, the Community of Fluorn wine concludes the establishment of a Community ra in the future ancient area.
Before the debate, there is an important information: the purchase contract is signed for the remaining majority, reports citizen Bernhard Tjaden.
It will continue until the area of the church community belongs to the community, but there is no longer a planning barrier for the project voting by a private investor.
This is why there is a debate on a Community ra.
One of the two investors who are still in the ship has proposed to come to the community.
In the earth, he would provide a residence area - about 55 square metres - and a limited terrace with always 70 square metres of area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the Communities suggest that a Community space is not as a meeting point only for the residents of the senior residence but openly in the community.
As an example, the word from "Strickcafe" made the word.
The decision proposed by the provision of resources for the current budget already in the past income will be submitted by the options of promotion.
The building is in the sanction area.
The establishment of a Community ra, as reported by Tjaden, would be able to promote 60 Pro > 30 Pro.
The proposal for a decision is to signal the investor that you do not want to throw a knight between the legs in this regard, to find that both satellites - which are inclined to the environmental building - as well as Pultdach - which reduces the seed and makes the building economically - would be possible.
Unnecessary, not only Wilfried Sohmer, if this additive.
When it's helping, he's voting to the Gremium.
It's not so easy for the Community.
Daniela Ruf refers to many of its own buildings with which you don't make it right, so you're leaving from the Community space now, she says, "I'm doing it hard."
Yvonne Staiger is increasingly referring to the Community area - however, absolutely against a communal share.
In addition, it views a covered subvention to beneficiaries or a lot of external investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, you don't give any advantage, but get a real, in doubt, contrary is the opposite.
The Stepper's request to divide the proposal of the decision shall find three benefits in accordance with the proposal.
In two votes, it remains in the original programme that Stefan Haller agrees: "If we take the decision so, we will make a step to close a happiness in our infrastructure."

Rotate in the harvest of stars to stars
In Harz, the first "star path" will be found in the top.
This is the United Starwater Sankt Andreasberg.
A planet road is available in Gods since 2003.
A "star path" comes to the need for information of many hard visitors, he called it.
He verbinde Nature, ↑schaft, movement and sports performance.
Members want to build route tables and inform them about stars and stars.
In a first phase until 2018, the unit "goodly accessible install" is located on five to six places in the overhart.
Question of St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeit and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be added via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network receipt plays a role in the location selection.
Furthermore, freedom is a criterium.
Later to expand the star path to move.
"On the star path, the viewers learn much valuable, for example about the physics of individual stars," explained the United.
They also learned why the stars had different colors or why a star was more lighter than another, although it was essentially remote.
It will also be provided in which the star picture is selected and where it is the best to see.
Since 2014, the United States has been held in the Montenegro St. Andreasberg, the most largest northern Germany.
The locality in the middle of the National Park Harz, according to the information of the Federation of Natural Protection of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often from there from the milk roads and even the Andromeda galaxie with only eye are clear.
In the Uni City, since 2003, there is something similar to the planned stars - the road of the Planetarium.
Beginning before Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inner of our sun system, the planet road leads up to Hainberg and Starwater - as well as a "external" location in Diemarden (Community Similars) with the planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets, including the degradated Pluto at the endpoint, are set out exactly in distance and measurement from one to two billion.
The earth so smokes on a bottle of 6,5 millimeter diameters, while the exact 75 metres away the sun still misses 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet road is well four miles.
As the sun’s light needs about eight hours to the Pluto, footpassers need an hour to steel with Pluto.
So footpassers are faster than the light in the world Hall.
The March to the next fixster, but it would be a half-year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko are first meetings, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collection course to insert the most stressing box fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unrapped World Boxing Council Leftweight Champion, the Flur went down to welcome the World Boxing Organization Super-Fight Weight Champion.
After Garcias Vig, by a single decision on the former four divisions-Welt Master Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for Pound-List.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How's it with you, Champion?
I want you a lot of happiness."
Lomachenko defends his gartle against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at ESPN at 19 hours.
When the couple had placed photos, Lomachenko-Manager noted Egis Climates that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect size order".
"I am an ancient federal weight," said Garcia.
"I'm up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to avoid at light weight.
And he needs to move to light weight weight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boots take this battle."
Climates asked whether it should be on Pay-per-view, part of a part that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debt in this year to agree with Garcia in the next summer (37-0.30 knockouts) that is also interested in the fight against the winners of Jorge Linares Campbell after their lightweight title battle in Forum on 23 September.
"This battle could be located in Pay-per-view mode because all fans have asked him," Garcia said and later opened to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can produce this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "a great battle", and he might participate in the Sabbath battle.
But Lomachenko stood at the great praise for Garcia and said he thought he looked at the Dschampf Champion from Riverside, "I'm sorry, Mikey... You wanted the co-outs."
Garcia said the focus is to show the boxes, then boxes.
Both said they could see the moment that was built for their own battle.
"This is the fight to be carried out.

I'm more happy to do it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top battle, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great battle."
Four losers to the fucking places
In an accident on the A7, four persons were severely hurt on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira at 16.30 a.m., probably lost the control of his vehicle after the market width.
The pkw shielded on the right to the wheat, where he was over, and then stayed on the cup in the green street.
The four insects - two adults and two children - were partly harmful in the accident.
During the first delivery of the losers through the salvation service, the A7 was locked in the north for about one hour, and then the forehead could be held on the left road to the accident.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Tryer chain works better"
Ander Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 to the season uptake against Braunschweig that optimization of the divergence in Aue points.
With the first season game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result, there were not both opposers at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two opposers too much, and we need to look better in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The triangle should also continue to be optimized in the erzgeberg.
And a gate after a fridge doesn't want the fortunes to start again.
"For the future it will be that no one will be put on the line near Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his community is better accepted by the experiences in the preparation with the three string than with the fourth box.
"And I don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his Tree Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is safe for his thing, "for we just have in the triangle on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can well build," said Hoffmann.
"The proposal is, but that we are still better harmonising and we do not make so many play errors in building."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"And you can speak after a divorce from a missing start, you don't know.
The service could be right," said Hoffmann.
"And if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concur on the pocal, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular session."
That's what his tree didn't want to know.
"The beginning in the season I'll evaluate only after six to eight days of game," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of a benefit to Aue, only because the game of Sachsen in Heidenheim had to be cancelled for a time because of an unweather.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue may even be fresh, because they have no difficult and complete game like Fortuna against a growth favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know where they are now," says Fortuna's internal defendant.
The guests from the Rheinland as an easy favorite on Sunday go to the meeting at the end (fast) completed station of Aue.
"What we take them away, just because we have the appointment to come under the first six," says Funkel, whose bie's only with a download against Aue from nine games is positive.
"There is no community in the 2th Bundesliga, which is to be slaughtered from before," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"And to meet such a statement would be arrogant and exhaustive."
And so Funkel wants his players to live on Sunday in no case.
Published new results of Swedish asylum assessment tests
The youngest results of tests for asyl searchers in Sweden, which have been subject to a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of the tested persons are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes the exactity of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensical Medicine (Rechts Medicinal Network) has started with the implementation of the tests last year.
They should make the evaluation of the age during the asylum procedure more precise after the Swedish Migration Auditor (Migration Trade) has been criticized for errors in the evaluation of the right age of some refugees who were less years old.
Up to this day, Migrations Act 6.880 has sent testing cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of total 2.481 tests from the time of the middle March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty Pro日 (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older, while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "possibly under 18 years old".
The tests shall only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson by the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are remaining in the past months.
"We don't see a large subsequence in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty constant," he said in the magazine The Local.
The high percentage of cases in which the person was evaluated as over 18 years does not mean that the asylum applicant has lied over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that proposed that the investigated person be 18 or older.
When the journal Svenska Daybladet studied the 581 published results, she concluded that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old in this year.
The method of medical age evaluation, in the recovery of wise designs and MRT receipts of clouds, then analysed by tears and radiologs, was also criticized in some areas.
A skeptician is the Endocrinology of Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological rabbis of humans to see whether they went before or later as usually through the public network.
"I had a reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safe, we should not do as if we could," he said the magazine Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the precision of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk to evaluate a child as a adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is almost under 18, in this case this is inappropriately 10 Pro.
Full of Plan
The work at the three bridges of the Road 108 between Lalijkebach and Schramberg are well in progress.
In the middle of the week, a seven tonnes of severe beton was installed on the bridge at the local song of Lalijkebach.
"We're very good in the time, it's great," says Reinhold Leicht, Bauletiers at the Roadshot and Ver--to the Governing Presidency of Freiburg.
In April, the works began at the same time at all three needed sanction breasts between Schramberg and La©bach.
The building is scheduled for October, and it is easy to ensure that the time plan will be fulfilled.
The first bridge from Schramberg leads over the trombach.
She's a pool bowling bridge from Beton, which is dressed with red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4,80 metres.
She was built in 1900.
Like the other two breasts, they came in the middle of the years.
In order to ensure stability and security, the three building works are now primarily sanished.
The two other bridges lead over the La'bach.
They're built from red buntsandstein.
Both were created in 1939 and were twelve, relatively 10,60 metres long.
The bridge at the place-singang of La ́bach has now received 1,30 meters width on the north side and seven tonnes of hard brain caps.
This is a border confirmation that will also be used as a operational road.
On the south part of the bridge, a width of 2,20 metres will be used on Friday.
Then the footpasser will go on it.
The particular is that it's about complete parts, a patent of the Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two breasts have already been affected with the patented bridge caps.
Beautiful feelings of fingerprints have requested to provide guides through the building work in La©bach.
For there is also a glassfaser cabine, with which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed by handbooks in the field of work.
The fish and cancers were to be fished before.
For the bridges between the building and the sample wheel in direction of Schramberg, the verification is simply regulated by an ample.
For the building work at the bridge at Lalijkebacher loceingang, the street is locked at the height of the hotels "tannenhof" and "Seven Linden".
The costs for the three breast-feeding are 700 000 euros together.
It will be financed through the country.
Department in Gerolstein: Under Protest at German Cartoffles Salat
It is not so often that partys go to a tragedy, but when the alternative for Germany (AfD) comes together, what else is difficult to be brought under a hair.
The parties represented in the CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a wide covenant that shows peacefully flag on this day, because the AfD includes the "great election attack" located in the Gerolstein City Hall Rondell.
And brings names at the beginning - like Alice Weidel, which forms the Spitzenduo with Alexander Gauland for the breakfast election on 24 September, and the steadfast president of the Bundes president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the start of the event will not listen to the afD teachers, but demonstrate.
The moto "The eggs remain up."
In fact, the town-Picknick was planned under the "All on a table" motto on the pool place, but now on the parking place below the Rondells place - and so directly before the eyes of those coming to the afD event in the city Hall.
A fucking picture that offers it.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the For--A world and one of the major organizations, is rightly happy: "Tough how many people have come together here."
There are music and every number of foods, including a "building cartoffles salat, which could also eat the AfD without problems", says the woman who brought him.
The police ordered many officers to Gerolstein, showing presence, especially at the bathroomhouse, which is only a few metres away from the event sites.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Vulkanefel, he tried to make such an event and received the assignment.
The 45-year-old Gönnersdorf had requested in Daun, but there was a derogation because the laurentium schemes already built were not enough parking places.
Now the Rondell, Hompes, is happy that "We can have such a beautiful event here."
With a choice on the event on the rondell area he says, "This is the right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
It also makes it: By 20 hours on the Rondell Preparation, a band of interviews in the town Hall varied speakers, including the Rheinland-Palace presidential Uwe boy.
In the room there are about 200 auditors who expect to keep their talks by the Spitch candidate for the breakday election, Alice Weidel, and the staff presidential Beatrix of Storch.
Unchanged is the police presidency, but the officers had even a hard evening.
Something more than one hour the afD event, the guests on the front place have a longer spirit, but there has also been indicated to be cleaned shortly after 21 hours.
The police can decrease - no special events.

Christian Stewart talks about their Bisexuality
"A number of people love insulted cakes and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything," so Christian Stewart is very open about their bisexuality.
"If I beat in a wounded cup, I think, "Oh, that was cool, what's going on next?"
The most consistent relationship of Hollywoodstars was the one with her "Twilight" colleagues Robert Pattinson, who finally went bitterly.

Or do you think I would have played it?"

So it never hurt me or hurt me.
I never liked it to be taken seriously."
Before it was under, she said "Bang Showbiz" but at school time when she prefered to clothe like a bub, "Not all girls are typical girls.

I felt really attacked, disappointed and disappointed.
Now I'm looking back and thinking, "Man, be proud of you."
With regard to the public, they don't want to claim their loved life: "The people expect you to be in a certain way and that makes me worse.
And maybe some call me as ungrateful, but I don't like to justify me before the whole public."

Coe lo日 "real" Russian excuse for Do-Scandal
The worldwide leader of the light athletic, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday, which he described as a manifest excuse from Russia to a Do-Scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be renamed into the sport.
Russian Leichtathletic Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the previous night of the lightatletic whilsts that the curse of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight Do.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were dismissed in the competition of gold and silver medals".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress agreed on the maintenance of the prohibition held in November 2015, after a report from the World Anti-Do-Agency (WADA) had found indications on Stately promoted Doη in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe said to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Føderation has recognized herself that she has taken some very warm times and will be done all possible to ensure that the federation is rebuild."
Coe said he was also "rejoiced" about that Russia accepts the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think it was a very positive day, and I think progress has been achieved, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to reuse Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything in the next months to normalize this situation.
The leader was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the devastated system," he added
Nine of the Russian Athletes are attached to the light athletics, starting on Friday in London, after the strict IAAF criteria as neutral actors.
The leader of the IAAF Task Force, Andersen, said on Monday that Russia must be satisfied with some of the criteria for re-installation.
The tests were still inappropriate and prohibited to be free, he said reporters in London after a report at the IAAF Council.
Trust for soldiers destroyed in Mali
At a festival in the northern Fritzlar, about 1000 people thought of the two of the soldiers died in Mali in a hobshawking turbine.
The ceremony was located on Thursday in the city of Dom.
On the other hand, the Defence Minister Ursula said nothing about the Leyen (CDU).
She kept the two murdered pilots, but as a "power of her professionals".
"We decline ourselves from this highest sacrifice they have offered in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old and the 47-year-old stabshopper from North-hessen had come to life in the middle of a week ago in Western African Mali.
Their sales were transferred to Germany, and on Thursday a dead Watch of the Bundeswehr was brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
On midnight, only the members of the church took Abschied.
Following the divorce in the circle of the family, the greatest friends, the representatives of the Bundeswehr, and the.
In addition, Hessen's Minister was also President Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The sorrow guests laid the roses down, and the members stood armed in arms on the swords.
Prior to the Church, Fritzlars and many soldiers followed the ceremonie on a liningway.
The Defence Minister of the Leyen approved the enveloped soldiers as " highly decorated" and practiced.
The stabshopper has built the tiger tiger's flight operation in Fritzlar and was one of the first six tiger pilots of his government.
In addition, peopleer Bauersachs, commander of the Government, who belongs to the soldiers, explained: "If this assembly couldn't decline, no one would have found it."
In the United Nations mission in Mali, the Ministry did not show the Leyen: the use is earlier.
But he is also of higher importance "for a country from which we are only driven by two states," she said.
After the holiday, the soldiers were brought out of the court.
When and where they are placed, the Bundeswear did not make any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried beside his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be placed near his wife after death.
This shared the king's house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish Kingspar is involved in the Dublin of Roskildes.
The imagehauer Bjørn Nørgaard has already completed a sarkophag for both of them.
The Queen agreed with the decision of her husband, it continued to be called in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, be still unclean.
But he doesn't intend to be used in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a hair that he was not happy with title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to become king.
2016 he went into the rest and also put the title "Princesshot".
Since Henrik in Denmark had not received the title and function he wanted, he did not view himself as equal to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby, the leader of the Danish King House.
Where the last rest of the 83th year will be finally, be still unclear.
But he does not intend to be employed in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has been in the last 50 years.
The genuine Henri de Laboarde de Monpezat, a son of a French Adels family, had known Margrethe 1965 in London.
The theme is in the French message.
Since his later wife always flew the sympathy announcements of the people, Prince Henrik had a serious position in his nearly 50-year-old regnance in Danish.
In an autobiografie, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was pregnant, I preferred wine place beer, stretch-sockets place, citroen place Volvo, Tennis place football.
Even for the gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia-tabak and the countries had the call to be the mark of social critical intellectuals, I was not able to hope for the monitoring.
I was different.
I seemed satisfied with this position and didn't shame me.
That's just two errors!"
Minister Weil wants quickly new election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Axis
The Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) of the Netherlands, is after the loss of the root-green government majority for a quick re-elect of the country, but he does not want to return.
Because on Friday he said about the resolution of the Parliament.
Previously, the surprising exhibition of a Green Deputy from its country-day group in the Netherlands had led the Government of Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country-day election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its small majority of votes in Parliament to opposition from CDU and FDP.
Previous Green Deputy Elke Twesten founded its step with the non-nomination for the election of 2018 in its election circle in Rotenburg (Womme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU group chief Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to arrest them.
The CDU and FDP together would have 69 sits in the Netherlands Landday, SPD and Green 68 Sites.
Too long the relationship was enlarged.
The new country day will be selected regularly on 14 January.
Thumler said that the red-green country government must now decide whether they can continue to rule in this situation without majority.
Stephan Weil, however, believes that it is inevitable that the landday as soon as possible determines its self-resolution.
The CDU group will probably decide on Thursday about its further action.
The Constitution also provides the possibility for the country to reject the confidence of the Minister and choose a follower.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These options must be clearly tested," said Thumber.
"It will be easy to examine all questions if they are legally intelligently tested."
Thumler named Twestens step "but something."
"I am not a foreigner.
I feel very good."
She seemed to be an attacher of black-green.
The Green invited the deputy members to return their landday mandate.
"We are obviously determined that they returned their landday mandate, which she received over the green country list, with immediate effect," the country president Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner shared.
The group president of the Green Anja Piel said, "We are dealing with the decision of each question extremely."
She has consciously decided not to lead out in the group.
"And before the background that there were no contentful differences, we cannot complete this step."
SPD-Kanzkandidat Martin Schulz condemns the overcome of the Netherlands Green Deputy Elke Twesten to the CDU as a contract.
"The behavior of the former Green Deputy in the Netherlands is not only a consequence to the electors and electors, but also a consequence of the Red-Green," wrote the Federal Boss of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He shall submit to the decision of Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly choose the country day.
The exhibition of Twestens costs the majority of the Red Green in the Netherlands.
The chairman places "in her damage and in her fruit their personal interests before the welfare of the country," criticized SPD general secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scandale that the CDU in the lower axis of this intrigen game can and try to kill the political capital."
The CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his lawyers to put each question into the CDU.
The group head of the SPD on the Bundesday, Thomas Oppermann, suggested that the result of the country-day election of 2013 was fair with personal career.
The CDU was the strongest power, SPD and green at that time before the SPD, but a large majority of a voice had a higher majority.
Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we take the lead, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses the eggs that are disappointed.
How could the scandal make it?
How the consumers can go.
Agricultural Ministry Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed with the Redaction Network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer be able to go out of eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to see the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stempel pressure.
The consumer protection portal www.life warning.de provides the federal countries the most recent information on the egg cargos concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know now, a health care is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the boat - because the central role of the reveler does not really be taken into account by the Federal Economic Minister?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal countries.
However, my house has soon been disabled and has been informed of Germany's concern in a close exchange with the authorities of the countries.
All information and risk assessments are eligible for consumers.
The trade is also concerned by the manufacturers that the consumed products are able to be traffickable and healthly unrecordable.
If there is over 0,005 mg/kg in eggs, they are not suitable.
However, unbeached eggs can be exhausted and distressed.
This time the operations are not guilty.
Sit productive operators and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, the production processes shall not be eligible directly.
In addition, they must be counted to be cruelly illegal practices of services undertakings with economic damage.
As always, there are too few controllers in serious case.
Does it only miss to the staff or to the final responsibilities?
It was just the official controls that have discovered the process.
However, the truth also includes that food fractions and crime energy can never be excluded to 100%.
That is why a consequent record of such events and the transfer to the State administrations in the cases where penalty may be carried out, is decisive.
I have already explained more times that I expect the responsible authorities to be an unfortunate claim.
Is the regular alarmism really necessary for food schedules?
Consumers and consumers have the right to get out of safe and trafficable food.
If a non-approval insecticide is used in the food economy, consumers and consumers are rightly addressed.
By means of the funds, manufacturers, manufacturers and consumers have been made in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
Basicly, it must be clear that the legal use of the insecticide of Fipronil in the holding of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately.
This must be consistent and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to reveal the content of the business without happiness.
How the financial rules of the football are affected on Neymar's movement to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing uninterrupted extent of football beverages will not swing Neymars Weltrekord Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come from the EUFA to Paris Saint-Germain, because the leading organization that has monitored the game has the power to prohibit access to the prestigious Champions-League tourner.
Financial Fair Playing rules called by the EUFA in 2011 mean that PSG should sometimes prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without great loss.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilians from the contract, and Neymar will receive a holding which will be used for several millions per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's turn to France.
PSG can safely make the money locker to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxie of other stars, due to the funding of the team through the rich dominant family of Katar through energy.
Joints can use a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but with legitimate income sources that enable them to Break-Even point in their business on the football.
FFP was allowed by Michel Platini after his choice to EUFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that those who had taken great debt in their effort to succeed, effectively threatened and risked to destroy themselves when banks or owners returned their support.
In 2011, the FFP declined from the consolidation to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.
The amendment means that the business model, which Roman Abramovich used originally in Celsea in 2003, purchased a potential club and then invested strongly in order to improve the society and to build a global mark, should be a stronger issue.
Within the current three-year FFP investment period running up to 2018, Clubs may take 30 million euro losses.
And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in Ungnade in 2015, his EUFA follower Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare from excessive issues.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly continue to strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, responsible for the EUFA for the FFP, against the holded Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the Buyout clause of Neymar in a pauscale, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has undertaken a five-year contract so that the sum of resolution for the next five years may be determined by 44.4 million euros in the annual end.
The first wall of FFP sanctions in 2014 met the PSG with Abu Dhabi, which is in possession of Manchester City, with the most difficult sanctions.
The PSG received a money penalty of 60 million euros (82 million €), which later was summarized to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the family members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 to 21 players remained limited to the other normal 25 players.
The EUFA is looking for clubs who could try to overlist their financial supervision by providing their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.
In the interest of a catastrophic company, the PSG could sponsor if the value of the sponsorings should exceed the standard markets, the EUFA would not apply this as a legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when EUFA discovered that the value of the PSA sponsorings was revealed by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that a part of the PSG classifications to Neymar could come to Katar on the payments of the WM 2022 organizational commit.
But PSG and Katar 2022 have concluded that Neymar will become WM boots and could simply find such a manöver for EUFA regulations.
The current sanctions against PSG mean that EUFA will be more careful to observe any effort to implement the rules.
The EUFA had no preparing talks with PSG on Neymar's transfer, saying on Thursday the people trusted in the situation.
They spoke under the condition of the anonymity with the Objected Press, because they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The recent published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved more than 10 million euros with a total of 542,4 million euros.
The accounts for the last business year must be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, Merchandising and Trikot sales.
The Agreement determines that the application after the signature will increase at least 30 Pro.
The Spanish Liga was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she attempted to prevent Neymar's travel by assuming that PSG would lose the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial Do" with the Club and State," said President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, Spanish day journal AS, concerning Katars, the PSG's ownership.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is in possession of a `Aanian sport-Tycoon, shares the preservations of La Liga against a State financing a unit.
"It is the consequence of the property and that has completely changed the whole landscape of the football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If a country is a unit, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country."
Swiss is searching for a new shoggy supplier
In the past years, chocolat Frey Bord chocolate has made for the Swiss.
Now the sixth cooperation is before a possible end: the flight company rewrites the task.
Swiss-Speccherin Meike Fuhlrott visited a relevant report of the "Northwest Sweden" magazine on Friday.
As a result of the current planning, the Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half year 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and a quality check.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier of chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
17 million small red wheat packaging shoggy tables to 14 grams per year distribute the flight members before landing to the passengers.
On the costs, the Swiss didn't want to make information.
Branchen insides appreciate the volume of the task with the "Northwest Sweden" of 1,5 to 2 million Franks - the Micros daughter has an annual sum of about a billion French.
However, more important is the public effect: for a shooting manufacturer it is a prestigious task.
How many applicants there are in the new statement, the Swiss does not want to deliver.
However, only Swiss producers are in question.
According to the journal report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the Court of Friday 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a opinion.
Chocolate tables distributed the Swiss since 2006 to their flights.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Micro's daughter, Barry Callebout had delivered the chocolate tables in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo, Swiss introduced two and half years ago with the start of cooperation with chocolat Frey.
The aircraft company is together with different Swiss chocolate products.
On long-term flights, the customers of the first class will be used with leckers from the Confizerie Sprüngli, in the Business Class Nazi passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
The Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey, both in the business and in the Economy Class, also distributes the Swiss Schoggi.
Leftathetic - Discus-Olympics Robert Harting reaches WM-Finale
The three-time world master will finally fight a medaille on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympiager of 2016, was failed in the national WM division and was able to look at the debate war only by the tribs.
Similarly, with the first temptation, the Poland Title Defensive Piotr Malachowski, who was 65.13 meters far off for the final war.
Nostalgia goes in "Wat Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the neck
This recurrence of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the 80s, for the 90-year-Gehre-Era (as the predecessor David Wain and Michael Showalter drew the Skegge-Comody "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to greater things.
As a cultural artact, it is likewise a parodia and a corporation of our Facebook ability time of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like the time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (he contained an original story for a speaking dose of trees spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sharing on the cover of the gag - the middle age players play a lot of children that will be raised, however, they made impossible to win the last part of the widow.
"The Years Later", with his adults who are now growing up, is less emotionally confused and his parodia goes more after the giant prince, including a riff on the stalk films of the 90s, such as "The Hand That Rocks the halts" ("The hand that looks on the wheel").
At one point, a character is broken through an Apple Powerbook, some inline scates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Central stories are the same.
The lovely coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romana, has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity yet.
And there is another foolish-build plan, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-good impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always the excurses of the best part of the franchise.
It is especially a pleasure to see the everlasting young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons sublime of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of accidental illnesses that could admire this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" Series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion: "What Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how it will visit the films of "What Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon refers to a different type of nostalgia: to the rebuilding of the cold war of "The Americans", to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its East-Gegen-West Ring War Iconographic.
The commodity created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a ruler indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighteen years with both cops as friends, two officiers from Bukarest, fighting for truth, Atheism and the way of Marxismus linenism.
The main roles - a hard-soted Gregor and a idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (although a exporting product) and Joseph Gordon Levitt are synchronized on English.
It's a generous idea.
But it's not much more than a idea.
There are some beautiful gags to see (the police spent the time to see shack in the television how Americans may do it with football).
And the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides an responsibility game 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" involves so much for the reality of a disturbable propaganda drama - a murderer that carries a reagan mask, will be included - that it often plays like one.
In six long episodes, it goes to it, and the commodity is not quickly or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited at a lower length, could better provide his Agitprop satire, since Gregor and Joseph always visit the `Aanian message, whose lobby is always occupied by two deep men who spend a hamburger's hole.
The message for the imagined communist public is that western culture can make everything for food for a stock.
The female Roman Creators did not wrong: We do it even with our younger story and their own.
Battle against Mafia in the country
The police is a fight against the Italian mafia in Baden Württemberg.
In the middle of the morning, in the Black Wald-Bar-Christ, in Rottweil, Constantity, Eating and Stuttgart, many objects were searched, as the State administration notified the Constantity on Friday.
In this case, 15 accused of age between 25 and 77 were adopted and already adopted a mandate against them.
The employees provided greater quantities of Marihuana and Kokain, shopping weapons and several hundred thousand euros.
Due persons were arrested in time-like divisions in Italy.
In contrast with the two contemporary Italians, there were German arrest orders.
Therefore, the two are probably delivered to Germany.
The action was participated by Italian and Bayer investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were in use.
The members of Mafia are subject to organised criminality, serious violence, disturbing murder, and rape and pressure.
Since Summer 2016, the State advocate has made constant against the organized trade in the South-East Space.
Among the State agencies in Constance and Palermo was a government exchange, and the Kripo Rottweil investigators had nearly a daily contact with their colleagues in Sicilia.
Thus, the big appreciation was also accompanied by four palermo officers.
In view of the investigations, Italian states, in particular, with a reference to the Italian Mafia.
Moreover, a case of 27 May in Hüfingen, at the morning tomorrow several shoes were cut into a hostage, should go to the band account.
In a way of complaints with big distress in the foreign government
"The data of citizens that should not be found there" is a report that the foreign Governor in Germany shows significant deficiencies.
This leads to severe failure decisions in asyl procedures.
The mandate for the management of refugees of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen, has noticed a media report on big flashes in the foreign central government.
Manufacture of the data registered there could lead to "too-partially graved failure decisions", warned in an analysis of the "South Journal".
According to the Governor, the information is found in millions of people with foreign stateholders, including about 5.7 million from non-EU States.
The data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 strangers in Germany.
Because the data were not available sufficiently, the data quality was not well in parts until.
In particular cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who have no longer lived, or by citizens who have become citizens of Germany and shouldn't go into the Governing Body."
"Independent data information can be significantly renewable," says the report further.
Statistics on exit liabilities include EU citizens who do not have to travel out.
Such false arrangements, however, leaded to a deteriorated debate on the coming of the outcome committees, as follows, in the analysis.
In addition, the Federal Government has obviously started to return to Italy with a family of refugees under 16-year-old children when they are entered in there.
This results from a internal paper of the Federation of Migration and refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Journal".
Therefore, in the paper, the BAMF has conducted such procedures "with children - with exception of young children and children - to Italy since 1 June 2017."
Since the end of 2014, it was practically not possible, so the newspaper was linked to the difficult situation in place.
According to Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU State are responsible for the first receipt of them.
If a migration continues to travel into another EU country, this State can return to the travel country.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "Instead, the capability of adoption for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has granted guarantees for the collection and attendance of families.
Even the European Court of Justice for Human Rights (EGMR) is to be sufficient for these obligations.
Moreover, other EU countries would return to refugees within the Dublin Agreement.
The internal political speaker of the Link Group in the Bundesday, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children have suffered because of the failure in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a disturbance of the child's choice."
Second best result achieved
In total, 220 litres of blood of persons living in the surface had already been provided for other people.
At least of the 12 citizens issued on Friday.
All in front of Jürgen Greule, who shared between 100 S and 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, the community appreciates the multi-fold preparation for blood.
"It's genuine how our body's designed for it and we'll give the spenders respect that provides their blood for strangers, even unnecessary to it," stressed citizen Master Karlheinz Kistner.
"On one bloodspalm helps many people," said the Cruz Preparation Leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Meat Bakers, because the conserves will be replaced into their components.
Three people could benefit from a bloodspender.
At the same time, the meat bathroom reported about the actions carried out in the early year in the Upper River.
"In this year, we achieved the second best result with 114 spenders," said the DK Cruz Preparation Leader.
Obviously, the exchange to the theater house has led to shareholders a few years ago.
Thus Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schock, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbers were counted to the multi-speakers and were issued for every 50 bloods.
Half so many exhausted Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfromer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter 日 Wednesday delivered 500 billion from their liveshot.
The Bank of England will hold the rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England will probably be informed later that the rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weight of the inflation has decreased the speculation over a growth.
The Bank of England warned that the economic growth will remain "country" when it maintains the rate rates on family income in the middle of a strengthening pressure.
The political decision-making members of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 in order to maintain the rates of 0.25%, while less Members in this month tried to increase because the weak economic growth has reduced support for growth.
In its four-year inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,7 % and for 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that the pressure would continue on the budgetary income, whereas the inflation would be expected to increase at least 3 %.
But she signaled that in the next years, price increases would be needed to move the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that the credit currencies might have to increase more than expected to the financial markets.
The members also agreed to restore a part of the Mammut conjuncture package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will request time for the funding plan to provide more financial funds for banks since February coming, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling.
The bank said, "In the central prognose of the MPC, the Bruttoinland product (BIP) remains shortly weak, since the pressure on the real income of the household continues to carry out the consumption."
She repeated the rates that "a certain penalty of money policy" would be necessary to cover the inflation and a "better" measure than the markets expected.
The markets are currently prognozing the first increase in the quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
The Bank, however, pointed out that increases would be "decreased" and "limited".
The adjusted growth forecasts of the Bank for this and the next year are compared to 1,9 % and 1,7 % for May.
She maintained her growth forecasts to 1,8 % in 2018.
The point falls according to these messages to the euro and the euro.
The point falls by 0.5 % to 1.31 US dollars and falls by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros.
The decision shall not be modified after the latest deteriorating growth rates have decreased the increased expectations of rate increase and the BIP has increased in the second quarter of 0,2 % in the previous three months to 0,3 %.
The growth will probably be 0.3 % in the quarter, although it will be easily recovered after the bank at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report was a little disappointment for households that are affected by an increased inflation and low level of content increases, since the deterioration is going to be worse before it will be improved.
They agree that the money policy in the next years cannot prevent the income income, but they will ensure that the salaries will be repeated at the end of their three-year prognoses.
The economy is also enhanced by the increased request for British goods, which is referring to the weak pound, which will provide a part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes to 0,25 % in August last after the chocking EU vote that caused the penalty.
The Bank appreciates that it will probably last four years until the prices and the economy will be completely achieved.
Before the last sentence of the Bank to the price rates, the call was decreased after an increase in rates, since the inflation increased the pressure on hard-declined households, and three political decision-making decision-making in July requested an increase in 0.5 %.
The inflation was estimated by 2,9 % in June to 2,6 % in the past month, although the bank said that it was expected and that it would be recovered in the next months.
The Bank said that the override in relation to its goal of 2 % is to write "ganz" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "The view of the recent retreat of the Swap Councils should be more competitive because the credit providers are looking for business and wanting to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks especially good for those in which the current deals run and close the new hypotheches, and many with free options and low advice will always be popular."
NHS (National Health Service) should write the strict HIV drugs 10,000 people
Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment since September after a battle before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the NHS.
NHS England reported that a pre-position prophylax (PrEP), which could reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients about 86%, is now delivered by health service through a first three-year study for 10,000 estimated people.
He declared ready to finance the process after the Court of Procedure in the past year had approved a judgment of the Master Court of Justice, whereas the NHS had the power to solve the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should financ it.
The shock trip announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS English Chief Simon Stevens as a "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) included this as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will belong to the first ones that will be enabled to register people, and other clinics will be followed in October before it is introduced in April 2018 in whole England.
Preexposition prophylax (PrEP) is a result of HIV preparations used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The PEP has demonstrated significantly reduced HIV transmission in infectious patients.
Taking PrEP before sexual traffic means that there are enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or both hours before sexual traffic.
Those who are in question for treatment belong to bottles or bi-exual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-equivalent partners who have not been treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified that agree with the responsibility, men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered at a householder can also engage in their local shared sexual clinics.
The programme will be worth 10 million £ and NHS England undergoing a treaty on the delivery of medicines this week after a international competitive acquisition.
It should evaluate the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical claims, such as it is used in a large scale, recorded and implemented.
Stevens said, "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the large and lasting effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milenstein in the progress that has been stopped more than three years in the promotion of one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said, "This is a decided moment in combating HIV.
PrEP, if it is aimed at needed and acquired people, offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS financed trial in England to develop a new instrument that is actually individually controlled and not with a negotiation with a partner, which leads to improvement of many, many lives.
We welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be given to the rapid execution of the field in the whole country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left.
Now, since the PrEP test medical has been obtained, we are on the best way to spend more than 100,000 HIV inherited people."
Sharon Hodgson, Scatter Health Minister, said: "The beginning of the PreEP process is welcome and overcome after monthly late and late implementation by the Government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life-modified infection.
This trial brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that these situations be performed as quickly as possible throughout the country to switch people who are HIV-infected, and that they will help us to draw closer to the end of HIV broadcast in the society.
The big life lives: between shadow and smart designer-Tūrks have converted these small Earls Court apartment into a great house
Joanne Leigh, an earlier banker with a patience for immobility, split up from a large house in Knightsbri¤ to an Earls Court Apartment.
It is in the first stone of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it is a evidence for the new design that Joanne has not packed and overflowed its bags.
"Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbri in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high cover.
I have made a boat in it, and on this day I have made a boat."
Since the first visit, the 1.000 square foot was completely overcome a large apartment.
At the same time, a single room-apartment with a disgusting layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the sleep room - Joanne Stauraum and a middle-sheet to use the great cocktails optimal.
"I wanted high cooks, big windows, many lights.
That was my request," she says.
To this end, she ordered the architectural and design study Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Noting Hill to use 12,5 feet high cover and to create a house that was not only a development but also a place for life for Joanne.
The deck was not enough to place two spaces together, so the ecological challenge was to create a cross-border in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steel work is very complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were covered each other without we had to buy.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two spaces in full height - with a lot of extraordinary drama.
For the cross-border, a classic copper light window of Retrovuius looks down over the glamourous residence area.
Reflected gold mobs, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mo Family lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, room and light.
At both ends, a short korridor is reflected to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the input, reflected units offer a place for all beaches and glasses of Joanne.
By accepting a glamourer ra ́, the beauty of the room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Combinable kitchens are nothing new.
The question of this is that it's a garage.
"A little engineer art went in there," Erfan explained by the steel strengthened, furnished MDF door.
"It's opposite, so if you move the door up, it's very easy."
Thanks to the clear use of room and stauraum, Joanne could have won 16 m2, a suitable sleep room and a improved layout.
"After the end of the day, you will overwhelm the ground area - or how your immobility is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a roudymentary form, an immobilious maculator will enter into and carry out a stock based on the ground size."
Here they have been able to enlarge the ground area and use high-valuable materials that make the room its luxuous benefit.
"The materials are the things you touch and thus help to create a emotional connection in a house," says Erfan.
"You don't love the electric stack-doses in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can be transformed through design and increased quadratic metres of something standardly into something very surprising.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers fighted for a $500 million inmobility empire
Two brothers have been four years after their Italian family found the dynamic, in an exhibition due to one of the largest immobiliary empires of Victorias in the value of over 500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and Developer Colin De Lutis le日 in a vila in Toorak, only three doors from Property younger brother Paul. This brought him to the chief courthoof to make it clothes how their ownership and business power should be divided.
Paul wanted to get away from the family operation since 2014, but a scarce divorce on the trend is located in the Master Court of Justice.
Along with their mother, the brothers have 38 immobilies in the value of more than half billion, gathered, since the family bought a business in the Propertyith Street, Collingwood.
There the Westco Jeans family was founded and growing up to a cat of 160 individual businesses.
It was born in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.
This money was invested in immobility, and the Portfolio of De Lutis is now included by the offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and the purchases in the city.
After an agreement with his deceased father, Colin - by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company power and Paul about a third.
A judge states that this means that Colin ownership in value of 316 million € and Paul in value of 176 million.
The division of immobility and Barbald has shown himself as a problem point for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
The last Friday, after several disappeared sentences, the first hearing of the Master Court of Justice was found.
The brothers have also been fighting over the control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded.
Colin arguments that this is not true, but Paul suggests to manage some possessions incompatiblely.
In a former affidavit, which was introduced by Colin, he says he hopes to join the fight.
"My Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports of companies, including Deloiters, Pitcher partners and Charter Keck ́mer, and with leading advocates, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides of advocates.
Ms. De Lutis and her disrupted husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, the milkbars and delicate business carried out from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventy years.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood Liquidity in Colin opened the first Jeans load of the family.
Colin says he started Westco, when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (approximately 10 years old)."
● De Lutis says that they and Luigi who died in 2012 hoped to give their ownership to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go before the court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis enterprise group, and Colin claims that Mark has been paid in the release of the company by 10 million and 26 million.
As long as Lucas and Mark are, Paul says, "the conditions of their financial training have been distorted."
Colin was very back, although he was an ancient AFL-president member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their advocates.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say, "I can't really say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It's very, very triste that my brother Paul has decided to blame me and drag our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In the midst of 2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to comply with his brother's requests.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I to end in our current war," he said and said, "he always hopes for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our business will be solved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trumps of the new staff boss are planning to endanger the media disturbance of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new whitehouse boss is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Trump - > the reports of the media - in the hope of keeping the head on a balanced course.
Here is a part of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new chairman of the White House, meeting the first working day with leading employees, he put a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information made in the hands of the President.
Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he had received information."
Kellys Diagnose makes sense, but others have tried to wear the Trump by monitoring its media diet.
The President Trumps' relation to television has been back enough years - and now where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.
"If Kandidat Trump was injured because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a correct reporting of posts to be convinced," said the former election boxer Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control is six former election officers to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a permanent lobby price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trumps Twitter's habit ever was "under control" is a smile.
Maybe these campaign officers know something that we don't know else that Trumps Tweets without their interventions would have contained more incense.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets that the Trump hasn't sent.
If his employees had made him a few times to keep bad from him, their efforts have been recompensed.
But nobody could prevent it consequently that Trump calls counterfeits.
A part of the problem is that people in a white house, which is combined from competitive parties, are always trying to introduce their own agenda by presenting Trump material, which may promote their views from the world.
Politico - fullly occupied with this story - reported in May about the pleasure of the advisers to give the President doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officers say that Trump like a Vulcan can respond to negative pressure exhibitions, especially such with protective lecks, and that he understands where these are.
That is exactly the end of February, when someone who had a badly printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Professor Charles C. Johnson, who charged Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a hole of Lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been prolonged from Twitter for shaking, or that he has not offered specific evidence or that he has expressed false prejudices in the past and has rejected it.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher concluded that the early staff officer Rence Priebus and the white House General Secretary, Rob Porter, "sought to implement a system to manage and document the paper frame, receiving the Trump".
How did that go?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same.
Maybe he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors still strive to influence.
These unchanged ones make Kelly mission very difficult.
Most visited criminals received post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be worshipped and hoped.
Police throughout Europe is sending post cards in this summer to age criminals on the flight.
Since the addresses of the seeking grave criminals are not naturally, indications from the population are expected and worshipped.
Europol reported on Friday of the action followed by the "EU Most Wanted" adventing calendar from the winter.
The experiences had shown that many flighters had hidden themselves to the vacation destin, it was called Europol.
21 postcards for seeking criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed, more than 2,5 million times have been viewed.
36 online discussions could be adopted until now, at least 11 of them on the basis of indications after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate over a grave and return to 'Millionary Travel'
Some of the most prominent householders in West Midlands are back with some determined travelers on the war foot, who have purchased one of the graves made by the community to require a field before their masters.
The travelers have parked their 20 apartment cars on a field outside a well-hashing street of Solihull, called "Millionary Roads".
They have brought horses, babys and a military of transporters, after they were released in May, but they have not been threatened by one buried by the Council to prevent their income.
The taktful group found a flash in the defence facilities and → their vehicles through a section that remained uninterrupted to find a way.
Wolking inhabitants have disturbed the Council of Solihull, who said that it is "unusual to consider the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "You have been sent by Bentley Heath at Montagued, after they were sent to the passengers.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement, since he was unusual in the process of the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were moved and are now back.
More came tonight, probably more today."
She adds: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long teachings to spend their parkings.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax, if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's fun that we just saw the last part of these travelers just to be pleased by another person.
The numbers have grown up this time, and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
One speaker of the Council of Solihull said, "We are conscious of an unemployed stock in the country, on the side of the Streetsbrook Road, and work together with the Police of Solihulls, and we take the necessary legal steps to continue as soon as possible.
To submit our evidence collection, it is very important that many inhabitants may notify an anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must be examined, where we present our case."
From Birkenhof is Waldhotel Luise
From the former hotel of Birkenhof will be the Wald Hotel Luise.
The house is currently renewed before the gates of the city of joy and will be opened again on 1 March next year.
These are news for the city.
Because by closing the Hotel Birkenhof by the During Environmental Company mbH to 13 April 2014, about 30 000 overnights per year and also income through the curtaxes.
In Herbst 2014, a dramatic increased number of refugees that came into the country circle offered the hotel building to the Agricultural Council as a collection company, which provoked conflicting discussions.
The city prevented the delivery of asyl applicants by establishing a building plan to ensure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not unconflicted at that time in the community.
Yet, in particular, Julian Osswald, overseer of the city of joy, defended the hotel and spoke of serious interested people in the house.
He should keep right.
The group of Luisenhotels with business leader Birgit Scheren with Sitz in Bad Bergzabern has the former hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three-stars-Plus-Categorie named Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joyful object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Park Hotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
In the former hotel of Birkenhof, Bauschutt container has been a longer time before the income, and when you come to the house, it will be clearly performed a large renovation work.
The bodies were exhausted, covered to part, removed old bathroomwagen from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is one only building.
To March, there's still much to do.
"It's a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scher in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything will be renewed in blackwald style.
The rooms will be equipped with big accessible ducks, which is transformed into the entrance area, and new windows will be built.
Everything should be "soft citizens" later, as Thomas Scher.
"We're going to make a piece of shit."
Swimbad, wellness area and a meeting room belongs to the exhibition.
You don't want to place yourself at the high level of hotels in La©bad, but already on a high level of inner town, Scher.
The Wald Hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be width, continues to make shiver.
As a result, individual vacants, groups or business managers have to feel in the hotel.
Speaking with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, he has already conducted such a shader.
The views of the city are covering with those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
At the height of investments, Thomas Scher would not be determined exactly.
Button under a million euros, he calculates.
In addition, the external facilities are brought to the president, that is already clearly visible.
In an internal head there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the aurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherr is optimistic: "Frouden city is a good market."
Russian Affairs: US Specialmittler set Grand Jury in
In the Russian Affairs on the US President Donald Trump, the Special Deputy Robert Mueller, after a report called Grand Jury, would have made a report.
The Gremium has recorded the work in the last weeks, the Wall Street Journal has written in vocation to people trusted with the matter.
The magazine estimated the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigations.
The sender CNN reported that there were already the first invitations of the Gremi in relation to a meeting between the older son of Trump and a Russian advocate.
US secret services have accused the creml since longer to have been mixed in the Presidency Chapter 2016.
Mueller investigates whether there were discharges between Trumps' election campaign and Moscow.
In the focus of the investigations, there are several men who acted in the election fight as a counselor of the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps of private and business environment under the Lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Meeting Trump has taken personally into the center and examined whether the President may have suspended the justice in the case.
The main assignment of Grand Jurys is to examine previous evidence in possible crimes and to decide whether accusation should be raised.
Grand Jurys is therefore also called accusations chambers.
In fact, they will be enabled if it is greater and conflicting cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The body may also be enabled by the State manager to propose persons to be conceived under jury.
According to the CNN sender, there have already been offers that turn to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian advocate.
Those who were shared in the meeting were requested for a statement referred to in the report.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trumps advisers and Swiegers son Jared Kushner and his then electoral boss Paul Manafort were at the talk.
Justice experts said in the United States television on the morning that the establishment shows that Mueller doesn't let it go in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not be urgently said that the Grand Jury will be enabled at the end to decide on the exhibition of a complaint.
However, the establishment of the Gremi in the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new enthries, the President used a talk in West Virginia to represent the Russian business as a campaign of his political enemies.
"The Russian history is a total discovery," Trump said.
The theme gives the democrats a chance to " feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about."
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a opinion that he doesn't know about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But this works usually in secrets, he stressed.
The white House provided any measures that cleared the work of the special employer in the way "faire".
The former FBI Chairman James Comey said three times that it would not be found against the president.
There is no reason why something has changed it, it has continued to be called in the clothes.
But Mueller was used first after Trump Comey had earned.
Because of this output, prejudices against Trump were sounded, he wanted to stop justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him for a position of investigations against the previous national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After the presentation of US media, the white house collected material against the special employer and his employees.
The solved specule does not refer to whether Trump Mueller wants to leave.
Instead of a independent specialist of the Congress, such as in the Watergate Affairs on the later returned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be theoretically addressed on the forces of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
However, several Senators of both parties want to avoid such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented legal drafts on Thursday, which would not be so easily released.
Antarctic: Gigantical Eisberg 3日 in the Antarctica
In Western Arctic, a gigantic iceberg has been solved from the nearly sevenfold size of Berlin from the shelfe.
This shared the Alfred Wegener Bremerhaven Institute for Polar and Sea Research in the midweek.
A billion tonnes of hard and 5800 square kilometers of big coloss is now going north and it will be needed two, three years until it is weakened.
He is with 175 miles long and a width of up to 50 miles one of the largest iron gigantes that the researchers have registered in the last three years.
It doesn't come out of him.
Where the climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg, it is unexpected to research.
However, it has been a series of unusual coverages of iron sheets in the region since about 30 years, writeing the US Snow and Iron research space (NSIDC) in a background.
According to many researchers, this can be associated with the heat.
The currently cancelled coloss was a part of Larsen-C-shelfeis.
Shelfeis swims on the sea and is cut off by great glasses.
Therefore, it continues to be in the sea and is regularly off.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is almost south of South America at the top of the Antarctic Halb.
At the north of this shelter, the equivalent of growth and abbreviation was caused a few years ago.
A complete shelf is fallen there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There are some things to say that the Larsen-C-shelfeis is also inside, because the previous border has never returned as far as now.
Moreover, the iron plates are under spending and can be cut off if a track is broken on a key place.
It does not increase the sea level, since it flourishes on the water, and iron burns so many waters as it produces after the smiling itself.
However, the loss of the shelter leads to that the glasses are directly to the sea and can run much more faster than before.
This may increase the sea level, however, only in small terms, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shadow of the Antarctica, according to AWI data with almost 50 000 quadrimeters.
In the past of the festival, it is up to 700 meters dick, at the frontier to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There's a regular degree.
"Although it is a natural event and we do not have any direct connection to climate changes, the railway is now coming into a better position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea.
"This is the most important backward from the beginning of the records," he also replied.
Subsequents should be restricted whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is now growing or returning long-termly and may be co-combined, his colleague Adrian Luckman and FÃe said, "Our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will be a long time for a year.
Even if these researchers don't turn back to the climate change, many ice sheets of the Antarctic Halbinsel have fallen in the past year.
This long circle of the Antarctica is extended to South America.
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the iron area of the Antarctic Halbinsel has returned to 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature increases to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Halbinsel has warmed around three degrees and counts it to the areas in which the temperature grows fastest.
CDU wants home tariff for personal
Since it is always more difficult to make free places, the CDU calls to get out of the worker connection to become more attractive.
Just before the summer pause, the Krestag has won 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and employees work for the circuit management in Mettmann.
Now 17 students have the first working day behind them.
The teachers at the circle are obviously very wanted.
620 requests were to be forwarded for the places to be delivered in this year.
However, the circle does not continue to work in order to satisfy the requirements and tasks set out.
Currently, there are 50 non-employed posts in the cycle Mettmann.
Including doctors and engineers and the powers of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiatives with the FDP and the UWG in the cross-border, and to respond to the manage of experts in the administration.
The administration shall, in accordance with the request of the parties, "build a concept of personal winning and personal development".
The objective is not only to cover short-term needs of experts, but to respond to the future orientation of the minority of the applicant.
The general concept should be guided by internal and external, establishing specific measures for increasers and included an open educational training, requesting CDU, FDP and UWG.
That's what you've heard after a good approach.
Because the circle has to do it with personal problems that you did not know before.
Other towns devote officers and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is of a regular "the conference of the public employee".
This is a high number of employees that separate disease or age conditions from the service.
The maximum time to act so that no more places remain unemployed.
However, Klaus-Dieter Volker, the leader of the CDU group, is still over the common request with his party.
He was soon in the cross-border for a fascinating surprise when he put the staff in question and the rest of the parties.
People want to verify all the possibilities that allow an exemption from the communal workers' association.
"If we do not come to a quickly satisfactory solution here, the circle management should also strive to cooperate with the cities of the circles," as the people.
This is why the CDU is trying to pay the employees and employees better than the provision of the tariff rule for the public service.
The containers are currently prescribed exactly, increases or more money are only if you change to a level that is oriented to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have been grown more in the past years.
A few weeks ago, new spaces were to be established where employees were concerned with the provisions of the new Prostituted Protection Law.
Not recently, by the increased number of asyl applicants, the Landrat Thomas Hendele and Circle Director Martin Judger have a problem: you have too few staff.
Italy enhances the sound to NGO migration ships
Italy has warned that the NGOs, using the ship of salvation for migrants in the Mediterranean, should not continue this if they do not follow new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new behavior code, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said the Internal Minister Marco Min in an interview with the Tour of Day of La Stampa.
My warning comes on a day after the Italian authorities had arrested a boat of the German Aid Organization 'Young Salvation' because their community had effectively associated with human operators in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration.
The Aid Organization, which has been operating only a year ago, refused to express the interpretation of the Italian State Advocate Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us is and the salvation of human life remains our most priority, so we are very sorry that we are not able to operate in the search and salvation area," said the organization in a opinion on social media.
"We can evaluate all the accusations that are currently raised, first after we have collected all information and can evaluate the situation."
The Italian authorities have monitored the boat of 'Young Salvation', the Iuventa since October.
It is believed that his occupation takes a ship of ships to be delivered directly by human operators, and that the smugglers can go away so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting had only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the State lawyer, whose content was published by Italian media.
The approximately charged is to monitor the Authority of the Italian Coast Watch, the salvation units in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the behavior code, boats like the Iuventa must have a Italian police officer at the board watching their A.
Only three of the nine of the NGOs, which are shared in search and salvation rates, have been ready to keep on the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Lastly, on Thursday, the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, because they would not bring to themselves "essential changes or obstacles" of their salvation action.
Of those who refuse to submit themselves, the Nobel Price Organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
In the meantime, Mina said that the number of migrants who arrived after the salvation measures in Italy had been strongly returned in the last weeks, which indicated that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and the cooperation with the local citizens were fruit.
"In the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He has made plans for further interviews with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Tshad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that have left these countries in hope to achieve Europe.
Appropriations and trials
Nine Weilermer cars, the "Berliner outer posts" and two guest drivers met in the Wachenheim in the North Pool to enjoy trials and visionalities for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The apartment in the Wachenheimer Valle has been shown as a good startpoint for the tours.
The garden and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at warm sommer temperatures near the winebergs to Michaelskalle above the Deidesheim.
There were points of view, partly on towers, from which you could look far over the woods and the preliminary levels.
In the meantime, there were still longer advances, rewarded for the long trials.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to saline and to the peoplesfest Wrest.
Repeat the appearance of the looking point, connected by "flow" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many height meters were reported again.
Hills, rocks, tours, villages, ruines and a households Welcome pauses.
In Bad Dürkheim, the cars in the free air-inhalatorium are inhaling the sun.
Even Neustadt was recorded.
After 173 miles and nearly 4500 highs, the group had known the Pfalzer Wald from his best side - sport and cultural -.
Console place Rasen - Bundesliga is stuck for e-sports
Do the sports stars sit forward to computer consoles, rather than fighting throughout wind and weather over stadium races?
It's: E-sport is longer to a severe-relevant branch, becomes a lucrative business - big stars, millions fans and big tours with high gains including.
This has also been recognised by the first associated corporations which are fully involved in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, VfL Wolfsburg followed the FC Schalke 04 and later the VfB Stuttgart, the Middle July founded a E-Sport Department and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to enjoy the whole new young target groups for the VFB," says Jochen Redgermann.
He's sure, "they're still going up on this move."
On the next week, the football welt band FIFA in London organizes the first "Interactive World Cup Club", where the players of different clubs are joined.
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Endhoven.
Moreover, Robin Dutt sees a great potential in the E-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen interviews an agency for football players.
"The real football must be in particular with the 14-30-year-olds that young people will go to the future," says 52-year-old.
And: The units are trying to obtain all possible markets, especially the Asian.
With prominent e-sporters under the Treaty, you could be more online than sending the federal body to Asia only once a year.
What is it exactly?
In E-sport, computer games such as "League of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or also the FIFA football simulation will be exploded on competitive levels.
At least, as in the normal sport, they have set up the lines in which the professionals attack each other.
And in the 2022 Asian games, E-sport is already part of the official programme.
But is it all about a right sport?
For many, the idea is certainly needed to be used.
Ingo Frobose has also been discussed with the question for a long time.
For the Professor at the German Sporthoch School in Köln, E-sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in the classic sport - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
▪ Cognitive skills, technical and taktic understanding and quick reactionability are needed.
Professional players should not only train the console but also train their body and take care of the food.
"The fitted player is a good player."
Frobuse, however, also see problems: "Do will always be more a subject."
Controls were difficult to be carried out in online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing.
Positively, the economics have the high integrative effect of the E-sport.
The players are internationally on the road, that is like a large global family, there are no intercultural heatings.
A series of business advice Deloitte and the Federal Interactive Training Software (BU) tells the E-sport a rare growth.
In 2016, 50 million euros were thus implemented in Germany, mainly on publication, sponsoring and big tourners.
In three years, the amount of 130 million will be decreased.
In contrast to the nearly 2,4 billion euros of the Football Bundesliga, it is little.
However, the E-sport is "no longer from the other established sports types such as handball, basketball or Eishockey", writes the Deloitte browser.
International countries are already on.
Great markets are Asia and the United States, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O’Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are shared in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood Shooter Ashton Kutcher is invested in the eSport-Wettanbier Unikrn.
There are some things that are done in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, E-sport has been introduced as a teacher, says Frobiose.
In the Netherlands and in France, the first football units are binding between Dutch to set up a E-sport section.
"In a comparison, Germany is behind," states VfB-Prest Rootgermann.
Only to fall in Nostalgia, and to confess the old times, there is no longer enough today.
It is to keep the United Tradition, but to fix the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt, too.
"They can't be sure that only on football everything remains like it was always."
Gift-Eier ade - The eye alternatives for cooking and bathroom
On the basis of the scandal for gifted eggs, almost all alien countries are affected.
Aldi South and Aldi North have reacted and taken all eggs from the sale in Germany.
Only eggs that probably do not contain fipronil should be taken into the regals.
Michelle Carter sentenced by the texts that Conrad Roy strikes to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced for two and half years because she urged her friend by texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will be sent 15 months behind the grills and five years have been exposed to bear.
Carter was condemned in June because of a carrying murder by Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the audience, "My family is incredible.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was able to stay free to call.
She had been confronted with a highest penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both Mr Roy and I had a psychic disease.
In red horses and a creme colored blue, the carter was there with trees in the eyes, with old hands and below, when it was condemned.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the State advocate said to the Court.
"He ended his life to make her own better.
She has no responsibility," she said.
"He hasn't shown a rio."
But Carter's legal lawyer said that it was a "dangerous situation that they were completely suffering."
However, judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that her "ancient or reefgrade or even their spirit disease has a significant influence on their actions".
A state lawyer reads a clothe of Roy Mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day that I don't trust the loss of my dear son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I walk with all things. I try, despite all my pains that we will be with us for ever, to be there for his sisters," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she would be "followed" by the knowledge that she would never share in her brother's wedding or would be a tattoo for his children.
"No more to have this only person with which I was together since my birth every day, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the hold of my life," she said.
The case seems to have a legal case of presidency, since there is no law in massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit self-mortality.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found by a coal monoxide in a vehicle in 2014.
The case took national attention after Carter's text communications, that she had encouraged him to finish his life.
"Stop up, get out of a building, get yourself out, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before death while he was with his family in the vacation.
At the moments before itself, she wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is to enable the generator and you will be free and happy."
The judge Moniz said that Carter looked for attention through the death of Roy and ordered it to benefit from any pressure from the case.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
The few of the Carters were Amanda Knox, who was condemned by its British resident in Italy due to murder in 2007 before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published in Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new Mini Lahm of the FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich wanted to run in the Audi Cup as a Captain, it is not a case.
The FC Bayern took a great season to the Confed Cup Seager - extra motivation does not damage there.
Something was different in the cabine, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the associated clothes were very small, very small.
But where far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, wasn't Philipp Lahm and no new manuel, he made his shared bond to his arm.
"The Tree has not announced it," said the Confed-Cup Siger behind, after the first use of the Bayern Captain.
Good, the station could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.
But the sign of the coach was also able to be so deceived.
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal was chosen in the professional from young players, debutants and just from the vacation C-Elf as player, but he.
Sockerl is distributed in the most loved persons to whom you are confident that you want to keep on the launch.
So who is chosen to reach the hereafter of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
"This is what you want to play as player: take responsibility."
In the midweek, the 22-year-old was a mini-lahm over the field.
Right behind, that's now his position, the white bowl on the arm made her surroundings.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this starting format as the one who can take the ruder the best in the hand.
He gave instructions to try to link the unplayed troops.
He had the whole cup, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overcome his violent fitness (founded kaum); Renato Sanches to link the devil to the performances of Asia's traveling (which was only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle would not be negative in their first arrival in the Bayern Tribut.
It's always been good.
Süle walked near Kimmich, Rudy before the divorce, both acted sovereign.
The novelly occupied Napoli storm often became difficult, also trying a few times in the game building.
Although his colleague Rudy said that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a good work in the debt.
Game delay, time change: "For this style I was also received."
How unhabited this Bayern-Welt is still for new access, you have seen at the end of the party.
For example, Rudy was not one or two of the catacoms but specificly six or seven interviews.
Horizontally, after a few cracking statements in the back of his new companion.
There he heard an interesting state of Süle: "What happened here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game."
He never needs to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our OFB ladies
Austria's best footballer reported shortly before the Twitter game and wanted the ÖFB ladies everything good.
The Bayern Legionary is so close to Club College of OUFB Captain Schnaderbeck and is joined with our lady.
The twoth of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winners should be a special motivation price.
The famous Bayern Dussel may also need our ladies well.
Company satisfied with the Rheinland-Palace Minister: Economy lo · Wissings Tempo
It was often unexpected that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Grene) and the Economy Minister of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This is shown after more than one year in which the new Economy Minister of Volker Wissing (FDP).
Chambers and companies from the region speak at T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, president of the Association of Trier Company (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the desire of the economy that Lemke has blocked everything."
The biggest road is seeing Natus in the infrastructure policy: the closure of the car between Kelberg and Adenau is now up in the country's priorities list.
In this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure, until 2021, to establish building rights.
A role in the plans of the country also plays the western area of Trier, which is in the primary need of the Federal Road Plan.
The aim is to carry out the streaks in December 2020, says Ministerial speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus is a guide to regional, but international competitive enterprises.
The Industrial and Commercial Chamber (IHK) Trier streë, as suggested by Wissing, in order to enhance the paragraph in Supermarkts and stop the tendance of German wine exporting for years.
Wissing also has an open ear for people who want to create a company, lo ́ the IHK.
The handshop Trier in the new master bonus sees an adequate incentive for young students, says business leader Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros for the remaining master check and 2500 euros is foreseen when the deficiencies will be self-sufficient within the course of a year after the training of the master.
But the home task list for the country remains long.
In the planned road building, it was quick to create, at the same time, the country had a needed staff, says Jan Glockauer, head of the IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers who want to set mobility in the landscape are busy until 29 places.
The IHK calls for more tasks to external offices.
CDU Fraction Vize Christian Baldop refers to the compliance headquarters, the country investors 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country, as it wants to emphasize the minority of experts in the region.
Moreover, it is a deceitful building of a broadband in the country.
In 2016, regional enterprises evaluated the network supply in a IHK application only with note 3.4.
They are accused of stocking Internet connections and interruptions.
However, Eveline Lemke is currently out of the own and is still located in the Watching Board of Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become a president of a private school in Karlsruhe - where she was released again after four months because of unbalance.
Audi will 850.000 change the vehicles - car manufacturers see themselves confronted with an opposite
One day before Audi announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company was thinking that "the intellectual options are more than the driving restrictions" and that he related to → towns - including München, where BMW is seated - to deliver or endanger the vehicles.
Daimler reported on Thursday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be moderate to reduce its dial emissions.
No of the companies describes the undertaking as a revocation.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of self-employed vehicles in Europe and the United States to undermine the compliance with the rules for carbon dioxide emissions.
But the stick oxides that emit diesel engines are used as a carcinoma and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralization of gases equipped by the vehicles also take into account what makes it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive.
The German Federal Council Angela Merkel is also accused to reject the powerful car fuels and to ignore the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of peoples cars that could regulate the emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested, but return to normal vehicle conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of peoples cars, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of the thermodynamic was arrested in the development of Audi in Germany.
The former Manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not subject to delivery and could be sent to court in the United States.
In the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations in peoples cars after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to implement emissions rules in Europe, and an extension of a request that could be made to the United States.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be difficult to charge peoples cars: the Luxus car manufacturer contributes excessively to the winning of peoples cars.

Mordillos Knollennasen and the laugh against suffering
Mordillo was timely one of the most published cartoon characters, the kidneys of his figures are his mark characters.
In addition to 85 ¤Argentine is still on a movie.
His message: Laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years, he was artist, among other things, killed himself as a designer for happiness cards - what frustrated him.
"The most happy day in my famous life was the day that was lost in my job," he once said.
After St° in Lima, New York and Paris, he ended the 60s of the transfusion: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "stars" and other leading magazines around the world.

Lavendel from the Province threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of the Province in South Africa, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavendel is repeated because of the conditions notified at the doors and because of the diseases of insects, which are prepared by the farmers and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in the Province, said: "The lavendel in the Province is effective, because the plant has been exposed to the impact of the climate change, which has brought much less rain in the early year and in herbst much more.
This has effect on the duration of Lavendel's life.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transfers circtics, and there are many of them in very thick weather."
And it's a lot on the game.
Lavendel oil is not only appealing to vacants, it is also very asked for parfum and cosmetic.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, under-developed, or smoking.
So we have less parts of atheric oil."
The solutions taken into consideration belong to a better water distribution and the deterioration of deterioration from the ground, but also the practice of the PF with a swimming mixture of sound and water, and the development of sorts that are more resisting to severity.
The resident Geisa in the Turkish Rön today celebrates his 1200-year-old existence.
The festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medium age festival.
Crackers, tens, salaries, vacancies or a farmer shall be living in the town in these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The workers of the weekly period Riodoce are normally middle-week to check their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the State of Sinaloa through the organized crime, corrupt officers and unrepentant wars.
But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was told them that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-range journalists discuss what feels more safe: they should take their children with their office, which were the goal of an attack with granates in 2009, or leave them home.
Safety experts have written three words on a table on the front side of the room: enemies, neutrals, associates.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, care and feelings.
There are a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico.
There is no rest of violence, and while the bodies are in the whole country, there are still more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has reached his office in December 2012. 589 stands after attacks and threats under federal protection and until this year there were at least seven deaths in seven countries.
In the latest, her exhibitor and her inspirator of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and be journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to.
His faults will be deeply found, although his presence is overall - a great picture of Valdez, which shows his medium finger with the word "Justice", depends on the fasade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, Family T-Shirts, showing his dreaming vision with Brille or his typical Panamahut.
The workshop finds less than two months after death, and the reporters discuss about their shared subjects, the trauma, their alpts, unslavedness, paranoia.
Although 2010 was established a special bounds advocate to process the cases of journalists, it was due to the Committee on Protection of Journalists only two penalty procedures.
Like most of the thousands of murders that are associated with trade and organized crimes each year, the murderers of journalists will only rarely be presented before the court.
In Riodoce, they are still being treated with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are incredible and the territory is still more productive.
Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefits to the security debate, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to lose my time in this workshop," he says.
"Before we don't know why, we're all missing."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Office of the perioding Riodoce in the city of Culiacan.
He could only move a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced from car and was shot on him 12 times, probably because of the name of the magazine - which is translated by "Double Fluss".
The Sjöe went away inside the car and protected it nearly.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Requirements are to be freely interfered in Culiacan.
But for the subject Valdez there is practically nothing but weakness.
From Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bleeding fields of the country, since rivalizing groups were fighting here to fill the vaccine.
It doesn't indicate that in Sinaloa somebody or more people will be shot every day on the street or that the Friedhof is full of deceased, double muscles for kings who are greater than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "Ruhe" if only a cartle has the control over the Coast State with its valuable hair and travel routes in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was conscious of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a companionist and director of Riodoce, with the debt that he couldn't bear his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have been involved in murder.
In February there was published an interview with the Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalising card fractions in the war with the sons of Guzman.
This publication may have disappointed the sons, conscious members have bought each exemplar of the decade, as long as they were delivered in magazine.
The second error was that Valdez was not forced to make a newspaper that had published the same history to leave the country in his own security.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and outside, and his murder is considered a milenstein in the Mexico violence against journalists.
He had so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He was employed in 2003 as a experienced reporter for Northwest, when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and spent 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "is impossible to operate journalism without putting on the cost tax problem," Bojorquez said.
With the time, the journal deserved a call for the courageous and honest reporting, and the implementation and publicity increased.
Reporters loved that hard-to-doing studies could be published before Zensur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody else had to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce's establishment, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot price" for her reporting in Latin America.
In that same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing mexican history, wherever it was.
He volunteered that he had been.
"I want to live," he said at the time of the CPJ record.
Trade in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle", he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You must take the task you like as a journalist - or it or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do about so many deaths... why didn't you say what happened?"
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the funeral bird that could flee like a port worker, the friend who was generously with arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to overleve.
They trusted his rutine.
He'd always have his hot.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar against the office, and sit at the same table.
Now they ask, was his love for Routine his destruction?
His death has also forced her to ask her own adoptions about how they can do their work best and live thereby.
"You don't like it if you're working with their wives, their children, their clean business, their secret start and landscapes," to move.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high measure of self-senuary and self-containment.
Trust his own instincts.
If it's wrong, stay away.
The harm is, the issuer of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, "Greuch a sense that can be baptized ... and then the thing is done with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applied in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officers is home.
The landscape is still changing.
In the room where Riodoce's employees met for security training, they were suddenly not allowed to telephones. Days before it was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers are protected from 104 degrees (40 ° C) in a tree shadow.
They were ordered by the Government of the country to sß the Offices of Riodoce in a four-style building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half in the shirt, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belonged to the 50% of the police officers, which the Governor himself was not confidential.
There are months ago since the reporters have gone to the mountain country, where the bands de facto are under control.
Riodoce looked at three main stories for the delay of this week.
There was the murder of the brother of the former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposure to the State expenditures that could be able to go to the Governor's home city.
And there was a group who made an exhibition in one of the most closest restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the State lawyer office.
There was no official word about who was driven or how it happened, so it was offered a prespect when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the aurant is a favorite location of handlers and authorities.
A reporter experienced public records that the aurant was registered under the name of an institutional revolution party (PRI), which was nearly all political levels over the entire century.
Recently, several Pri-governmental authorities were accused of high-caracteric cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this location, including one in which a son of El Chapo Guzman arrived in a military accident.
Only a few months ago, the readers would have considered the Valdez column as the best information source about the exhibition.
"Before we had already known what has been done," said Villarreal, 46, with the name "El Flaco" because of his blind body station.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
The Office of Valdez has been enhanced to the conservation room for signs and accumulators protesting against the murder of journalists because the workers have become something that they have never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez shot a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning due to another journalist to the office of the State advocate.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after the murder of Valdez, in the Western Federal State Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and the employee said based on DNA tests that it is his.
In the whole country, journalists have become more sounder by writing in organised Protests "SOS Press" on roads and buildings.
On this day, the Governor Bojorquez is gone to Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy and kill journalists because they said the truth.
She then asked her to be re-distributed by the Government because she was concerned that her wound had lost her object.
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organised crimes, government officers and a equal society were "invoked".
In the last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by ­bands, but also by orders of security and security forces that were stuck with the organized crime under a cover.
The Media Watch Group "Article 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officers in the past year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said.
Of course, murders have a terrible effect.
No one forgets the death of Bloggerin Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.
Your body was found together with a note that was approximately understood by Zetas cardell: "Hey, I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and heads are located near their separate head.
Some have chosen to conclude how the journal El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the corresponding Miroslava Breach in the market.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was directed publicly to the cards with a leitartikel on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists are from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in the exil, and they still watch the streets and search for.
And sometimes they will be thrown as apparently to the photograph Ruben Espinosa, who was killed with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who remain and continue work is a daily dance with riskable decisions.
Ibarra, who wanted to be more deep, indicates that the trade was scared of him.
"Mexiko goes to Høje, and therefore I became reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last week was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the citizens in front of the office and dressed beer as they began to summ all their phones once.
A number of shooters with band rivals and security forces near the Badeorte Mazatlan had left 19 busy dead.
The war continued to scale, as it was pronounced by a number of Cartell boots in the region.
They published the news on the Riodoce website on the phone.
The title page had to be changed next day.
Sirenes shot near - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez put a cup on the police, keeping the guard to see if they were ready.
If they had the most, they didn't show it.
Under the strong portrait of the falling founder of the journal, whose medium finger was visible for the whole Sinaloa, Riodoce's workers followed his tracks.
"How can you just think about it," Bojorquez said, "if the same day Javier was killed, the practicant woman asked me to send her to report on the street."
Dinosaurier used spinning to eliminate his enemies
On the first corner, it looks like a statue, even though a terrible.
Now researchers have found that the first recognition of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker was so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosauriers".
It was so good that they could even find out that his shocked skin was of red brawn - and they said they had had had had had something of a "unsuccessful past".
The report in the newspaper "Current Biology" described him as "the fastest-handed dinosaurier that was ever found, and one of the best dinosaur exemplars of the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosau, which lived in the middle of the cross-time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incrediblely well-obtained state has blowned researchers who described it as "truely valuable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the painted Pf’engine is the best obtained fossil of his species.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grew on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that was missing from the surrounding rock on the place, and decided to look more accurately.
The fossil found by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within 2.500 pounds (1.100 kg).
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be enth.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it was sleeping," said the Chapter Caleb Brown, architect in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creation is to see.
"It will enter into the history as one of the most beautiful and best obtained dinosaurier exemplars -- the Mona Lisa of the dinosauriers."
Researchers have discovered that this pf’enfren, although it is covered with a covering and like a walking panzer, probably threatened by meat-free dinosaurers.
The strongly painted dinosaurier used a red and white darling to hide from raw animals, and used a decreasing technology that is as anti-scate, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have been allowed to meet himself better in his environment and spread his enemies, saying experts, which indicate that it was threatened by larger dinosaurers.
The 110 million years old creation from the Nodosau family has made the first line in May and is now to see in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museum Technology Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has made more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully.
The surprising maintenance of the exemplar enabled Dr. Mitchell and a international team of complaints, the pattern and the form of shoppings and destructions over his body.
They discovered the contrary taxation, a broad defence method in the animal country, which means that the top of the creation was dark as their subside.
Although the contrast is usually, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is overwhelmed by the living animals today.
It indicates that the dinosaur of sufficient pressure by meat-free dinosauries was embraced that evolution favored the decrease of the confrontation as means of survival.
But most of the timegenotic animals that use the contrary taxation - you think of rehe, Zebras or garden animals - are much smaller and harmful than beef, which signals that this nodosau was a real battle of survival.
"Starkes raw animals behavior on a massive, strongly painted dinosauries show how the dinosauriers must have been increasingly in the cross-time," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic connections in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was rotated.
Agencies continue to investigate the animal on the indication of his life, his conservated darmin content to find out what it has eating as his last feed.
They believe that the dinosaurier, when he died, runs into a flush and was cast out into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.
At this time, Alberta was so warm as the South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably broadcast much more landing than they are today.
"This nodosau" is actually notable because it is fullly covered with conserved skin, but also remains in three dimensions and keeps the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal is almost like today in the early cross-time.
You don't need much fantasy to rebuild it. If you just shoot a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's sleeping."
The cross-time was a time, as big therapy, meat-free dinosauries, which stood on two feet through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyronosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, was the penised dinosaur of some of his horrible acts.
This belongs to the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tonnes of hard monster.
The economys whose latest recognition appears in the Current Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta has exposed to the death of the sea and has been mumied.
The creation was found by Shawn Funk when he grew on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the Museum, it is the most sustained dinosauries of the world, → skin and rusting, and is completely from the snow to the back.
The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighted up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).
It contained two 20-soll-long sticks that were throwing from his cups.
The researchers believe that the pansed Pf's frencher was thrown through the Western Canada until a overflowing floor flooded it into the open sea.
But the subwater residence of the dinosaurier kept his resistance in exquisitem detail.
The crossed remains of this special exemplar are so well obtained that the shepherds are still covering holpeous panzer plates under the dinosaurier
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is like 'sound as a winning in the lotto.
As long as I see it, it'll be confused.
The skin residues of the skin are still covered by the holprid panzer plates that are covered by the animal's shadow.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are lodged up.
I can count the shoes on his soil.
In the wheel: Mass carambolage on A8:e damage
Several accidents on the dinner day on the A8: button 30 vehicles are developed in a mass carambolage.
There are many damage, miles long stones and gaffers.
On the carway of Stuttgart-Munchen (A8), at the latest weekend, a mass carambolage of approximately 20 persons was hurt.
According to the first information of the police, at 17.00 a.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (land Circus Aichach-Fühlberg) during a wizard, there were nearly 30 vehicles, including probably loading.
The precise number of losers has no information.
A police speaker said that it was easy to medium-term damage.
A large offer for saving vehicles was at the accident.
The A8 was completely locked.
In the driving direction, München was a kilometer long backward.
As reported by a AZ reporter, it also came to massive obstacles - through many gaffers on the opposite road.
The firewall noted the characters of the vehicle manufacturers that now have to be counted with receiving punishments.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collection between a car transporter and a pkw.
A salvation shooter was on the road to the accident.
German train: Conzern tested "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has learned: nothing unfortunate is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you are deep in his work and just have a genuine thought.
And then: puff.
The creator comes and wakes a ill or travels the train in the middle of the workflow.
Card check.
But the times of interruptions are quickly over.
The German Bahn is currently testing the wireless cart check.
You're just trying by a phone to take your place and devaluate the cart.
A testing process is currently running on two pieces.
"If you come to the boat, we'll make it out.
Then it will probably be available on many other television trails in Germany, "a train speaker said.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the travel card evaluation without creators.
To be able to use them, however, some conditions need to be fulfilled: you need an artphone or a tablet.
And you have to have a online ticket -- what you're doing without the most travelers.
It must also be over the application of the bathroom, which has bought the DB, which is the most famous type of ticket booking.
And later there was a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works so: You grow in the train, call his cart under "My Tickets".
Then, in the test points, a button appears for electronic evaluation.
The travel members receive a notification on their mobile devices that the X carrier is in the train and has taken the Y builded seat.
If the traveller comes to the cart checker at Y place, he knows that there is a passenger sitting with already depreciated online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, work, weak.
The "check-in" has two benefits: one for the customers, one for the train - which is to use the passenger again.
"Whoever wants to travel without ticket control through our travel staff, simply checks in the DB's tour.
This allows the passengers to make their travel time personally," says Michael Peterson, Marketing representative of DB Teletransport.
Second addition: "And our employees have more time than today to reach individual customers needs."
Whoever often drives the trains knows that near the late and lost moves belongs to the highest disorders.
Because often, in any case, you have, but one of the travelers does not have any documents that you have taken to evaluate online tickets.
Or the credit card, or the personal test, or another document to be shown.
The consequences are unfinished discussions between travellers and carrier guests, which lead to bad vote in the section or large space and delays in control of their own tickets and takes the creator at the end of the time to take care of other matters.
Only a small number of tests can use the new service.
And this is only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart eating.
Other move numbers on the same stream are not yet enabled.
How did an activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot up to her nuclear.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she sat in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of a airbnb apartment that she mixed and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stole over a post from someone from the High School.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old child, and it still lies on the street," he said.
Sorry that nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she fell Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the hand of @TheePharoah was permanently revealed on its timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis's territory was to kill the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year black, killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., alive.
He posted a picture of Brown's leblous body, which was spread on the street and would stay there four hours.
"It's worry," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She left her phone to return to Tweets later at night over people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos from the police band and people who cried, and a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who brought a gun with the record, "Fergusons police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a living feed where a police officer stood before a group of demonstrants with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer assured his wheat and cried, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not usually," Ferrell reminded her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder that we have used and that we can typically call."
At this moment, I felt shot fresh.
I was wounded and wept."
She bought a flight and went home next day.
After the landing at 23 hours, she took her six-year daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets"?, in China since 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and opposition, which consists of the view of people who have lived in the Community and the roads to request answers.
As Ferrell with her daughter, who took a flower clothing and a clothing crown, went to Ferguson, the two calls that they had innumerable times before this morning "over the black experience and the black state".
"You remember how I taught you when black people should fight for what they believe?" she reminded her of what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
"What has been done today is a point of its ... what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be opened in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different shapes of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to be free to save ourselves.
Even if I have the happiness to give her a experience that personally doesn't have an eclatant racism, it's not different than the next black women's children.
I feel that I would prove her a bad service to keep them remote."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florient Road, a place against the police officer who was in a camping area when the activists waited for the possible non-accusations of officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter have been connected to a local business engineer who made a breakfast.
They prepared shoes and helped to give them to demonstrators.
Lately, a new type of activism for Ferrell design started.
"My activism has completely changed after 9 August," she said and noted that she was student at Missouri-St University. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses, and has been able to eat justice and healthy inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all coming."
Weekly later, Ferrell met during a night demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-registers of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farers wanted to "document", what happened.
A question came to Ferrell, "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This schepsia was provided by numerous cases of people, often by white - in a community that benefited from their pain and their opposition.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and waxed in Ferguson did not have their voices ornamented and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already joined with the current co-register Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is in place for his activism around the death contract insects.
His commitment made Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other inheimians followed the team of "Whose Streets"? in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary film is not someone who talks to us or talks to us," said Davis.
"This was the main thing for me, how these people will be presented, because I will be presented."
The goal was not to conquer Ferrell's experience - to show that it was "not as a Messianic leader but as a community coming together", said Folayan - she proved to be the openly participant of the film.
Thus, documents of "Whose Streets"? surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she is deceived and she is married.
"I felt so naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be some damage in this work and in combination of black people."
Furthermore, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black-sweet women in the larger Black-Lives mother movement.
Two of the three reasons for the movement that after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 the film "BlockklivesMatter" in social media are identified as a flaw.
"Square, sweet women in Führer positions have made the movement totally," Ferrell said, "and therefore we continue to fight on different fronts.
Sweet, sweetie women need the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it refers to that "this is not a claimable type of action" in the ferrell has been selected as a heart of the film.
"He was the person who dropped this energy," she said.
"It's not a case, although she was at the front front, because in a life on these crossings as a black, sweet woman is so much on the game.
You can see their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have been lost longer, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is at a time for 21⁄2 years due to the blocking of a car travel at a demonstration.
She describes the social policy atmosphere of the region, which she calls her home: "A chaos".
However, she claims to an agglomerate and feels committed to this memory since she went three years ago in Ferguson to the street.
"It is our obligation to fight for our freedom.
It's our obligation to win.
We must love each other and be understood.
We have nothing to lose - except our bones."
From "droom" to "size waist": TV reader discussing bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it hasn't been built for long.
But the idea of a purchasing area at the south end of the footpasser area since the first presentation of 2009, the population is in the Beforder and enemies.
Cold doesn't leave the subject anywhere.
The subject is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfriend Bitburg".
They say one to the bit gallery: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "It would be really class" (Nicole shoes), comes from the other side: "Free no man" (Siggi Betzen) or very slightly: "Great Wood!" (Lars Scholz).
As the employees build that a galery goes more customers in the city, of which the other businesses benefit, the enemies protect that the footpasser zone will then explode.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the baseline on which the building Halls are located, in which 13 direct inherents offer their products.
With the beginning of the building work, it will be closed.
The galeries makers want to integrate a market trail in the new building - and even to the Beda place with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Room: "We have bought almost a week in the building Halls since many years.
Of course, our eggs, but also the cocktail kitchens of the landwomans are still very pleased.
We've also discovered the medzgeria for us.
We would like to have a chance to maintain this boat upright, even during and, especially after the building of the gallery.
It is also in other cities.
In particular, the small halls in Frankfurt are interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Insecting direct guards in a market trail in the gallery, it comes to the height of the middle.
But the new project should not just be low."
Eva Kilic: "Why's the boiling palace in Bitburg?
Whether clothes, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.
There's enough in our town.
You see how many loading businesses are here empty -- some months and years ago.
However, since there is not even a regular week here, it is more important to remain the market quota at least.
Because the product offered there is still fresh, mostly it is offered directly by the manufacturer and it is higher price value.
As you see, loading businesses in a purchasing centre are only accepted by larger companies, because they are often not travelable for a single handler.
Skade, special businesses are almost no longer, and whatever remains of it, then it will still disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A purchase room with a market chain doesn't match me.
And the gallery doesn't match Bitburg.
In particular: Where should the building Halls go during the building time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even at a time when the bit gallery comes really.
Or can the best bit gallery already be able to run out all businesses from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It's just not gonna work.
And a shopping center, which is empty, doesn't wear anybody.
I think it would be better to promote a right builder, instead of this gallery.
But for a building Hall, thanks to the habit of many - as I find - without sensible building projects in Bitburg no space anymore.
When the building halls are caputted, a part of culture will be disappeared again."
A similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of Fridman Gallery's room in New York, many faces are to see - white, black and brune, which are almost insignificantly equal - that are coastals from the cover.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and hairs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Maning sent the extracts out of the prison Fort Leaven日th, where the former secret service analyzer offered a 35-year-old arrest penalty after she published diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Becoming Resemblance (A similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose disability has been associated with their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and maning, a transmission and a dissident, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in Office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmical analysis of the DNA, which was extracted by Manning and was created from the 30 portraits, as someone could look out with these genomic data, a shape, although some intellectual comment is not only regarding the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of this interpretation - but also to the productivity.
Maning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the employment as a woman since her public network, was condemned in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations against the spionage law, computer distortion and debt.
By the prison, her picture was under, so much that there was only one photo - a crazy, black-white seal, in which maning is probably sitting on a carrier seat and brings a platin blonde piece - with which it was associated.
In 2015, Dewey Hagborg came from the great success of its 2012 'Stranger Visions' project.
In it the artist produced portraits of forests from forensic artefacts such as cigarettes and cowgumies by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look.
It was the time when she received a mail from a magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to join this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit this time and couldn't be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
Artists and their arrested museums were unlike letter friends who exchanged several letters within two years.
They even shouted a Comic "Suppressed Images" from Sholi Kanungo, which would have been able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would actually require only a few days after the book was published, Mannings freedom after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy meeting.
There are also some deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender groups to find new, twoable ways in order to continue to blow the stars that he should bear.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timeing of all these things, she said "That is from a certain basis".
In an artistic statement that is written on the wall of the gallery, Manning requested with its oversight signature below (the "i" in his family name is seen with a heart) a end of the "automatic splitting, which was based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite wall, their mitocondrial DNA sequence is a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in bleeding.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the integration of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the high-developed scientific lexicon of the artist) as amazingly similar, at least in biological view, we are all.
"What people hopefully take from is that our genom does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how efficient they are," Dewey-Hagborg, whose videowork of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to see.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in a own room is a page from the top whispered comic novelle.
She shows Manning how she appears in the hand with a free talk phone from the disciplinary of the United States as King King.
"If they make your speech cold, then they won," says it.
"So never keep your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who salutes from Philadelia.
"I'm still getting fat when I'm talking about."
Maning has not seen the exhibition - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if it should be done, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the space of the masks, by their own genomic simulators, which are combined as hordes of protestants.
This was also targeted, as all in the exhibition, until to the size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with bleeding.
"In the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a number of people," Dewey-Hagborg said from the portrait.
"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that also was behind her freedom."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employer of the University of Oxford for murder
A country-wide human jagd is in the past for a professor at the Northwest and an employee of the University of Oxford, who is looked for as a contemporary, after a man in a luxeous apartment in Chicago had been hit with deathly damage.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest orders were issued for murder because of their deep share in the death of Trenton H. James Cor­duranleau, as showed by the Cook County's office acts.
The documents say Cor-Duranleau, 26, died after several pieces.
One Community warning system published by the police member of Chicago stated that the body was discovered on 27 July.
The employees received a call, came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several damage to the body.
Cor­duranleau was yet explained at the place of the event for death, and detectives examined the stake as a murder, while the police is actively looking for the two contemporary officers.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor for microbiology and immunology in the Northwest since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in a mail record that Lathem was now authorised and was excluded from the income of the campus of the Northwest.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is the senior Treasury Assistent at the University of Oxford.
A speaker of the University and the Somerville College said in a e-mail record that "We are in contact with the police in the United States and are ready to help the US investigation auditors in every earthly way."
The statement was to add that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be presented.
Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, officer of the police officer, said he requested the convictors to be sent to the authorities.
"The police has a idea of her stay, and our efforts to locate them are strengthened," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities helped to find the convictives.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who just had received a conscious tip, which said that there was something made in the apartment 1008.
The police describes the scenes as very grass.
Guglielmi said that it was uncertain whether the case was found on 27 July.
It was checked by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The maintenance team of Grand Plaza published a claim to the people: "The police is currently at the time and the background of the victim and investigates a number of motives, a possible home event."
"We will end the WADA front plan in close future" - the Russian Vicepremier Mutko
The Russian Vitaly Mutko Vitaly Vicepremier said that it would not be long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Do Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Do Agency (RUSADA).
"In a specific stage of the inheritance of the driving plan criteria, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Do).
The WADA front plan was updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA driving plan to comply with the code described by the criteria for reintegration of RUSADA and recently published on the site of the organization.
According to Muko, he does not contain anything that could give access to Russia.
"All has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympical Committee (IOC) and the WADA in closer future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian Anti-Do discusses the results reported by the WADA authorised investigation by the Canadian legal advocate Richard McLaren must accept the stately promoted Do©s in Russian sport.
In relation to the matter, Mutko said: "We conduct the investigation because our anti-Do system has occurred a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes, and we will not give anything that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Sövnov, leader of the independent Russian anti-Do Commission.
In interview with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Sünvov reported problems of the past in Russian Anti-Do-Organizations, but then add: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains restricted positions and rules.
No one intends to accept this report without prejudice”, in addition to Sünvov.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 by WADA from the implementation of Double Controls in Russia.
However, you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the view of international experts and the UK Anti-Do.
Following a review of the main quarter of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA moves to the right direction to be reuse.

It is a pure prospect measure, which can continue from any healthy impact, it was called in the communication.
Only eggs should be delivered to Aldi immediately, evidently negatively tested on fipronylant anti-resolution.
Aldi wants to make clearness and transparency in his customers.
The start-ups that will help your company to not become the next uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness at your e-commerce startup, but the issues did not work.
Answers often were weak, little helpful or - even worse.
And even if you speak anonymity, some workers do not trust the process.
"It was simply never a conscience and objection," Errett said, "which was the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed".
She called people outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is at growth to help companies find out how their workers feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measurement of the worker commitment, it allows companies to make surveys to speak with special groups and demographic groups, to offer anonymity and difficulty-hotlines to employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to interact with C-Suite Führings and directly to the Administrative Council.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, the companionist and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used to measure workers' commitment.
Errett said that they had a better view of what your workers thought and felt in the three years with glint.
In addition to the Snap Questions and Questions of certain teams, it offers a Hitze card of the company, which shows the most challenges and the powers of conduct to show low approval results - so that you can follow why.
Companies are to realize that there must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next uber developed in skandale since a former employee has published a blog post described in the area of claims in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like clint, this desire is a lucrative business possibility after a review.
The global governance, regulation and compliance broadcast can be more than $118,7 billion values, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and recognize bad behaviour, saw a growing interest and A’s start of this year in the mistake of Uber.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, API Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently been reported as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent enables companies to send "Puls-" interviews, collect confidential answers in real time and see the warm cards of your problems.
It also offers anonymous SMS hotline that can report bad behavior with the employer.
And when the main business leader is involved, the complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of the public opinion has found the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and business leader of Convercent.
When a company is found that is wrongly treated or is unethetic, it can experience valuable consequences through consumer buykott, worker fluctuation and claims, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the aurant cat with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than one year to ensure that workers are conscious of their own and procedures and have a simple possibility to get their business centres.
Previously, if a employer wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company center, to introduce a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an inquiry and unfair experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no possibility to follow the complaints of employees.
Now, since the company is employed by Convercent, problems that have been hidden before by leaders sitting in towns or states - such as discrimination, disappointment or unlae practices - are soon identified and invited.
"I can draw closer to this total 360-grade view to the experience of employment," Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we'll strive to our actors before employment laws."
Company started to take ethics, values and workers commitment in 2002, after the booking company Arthur Andersen collected for ethical destruction through the Enron-Scandal, Quinlan said.
But it was a long time until the "Social Media came to their right", that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their disturbing waves online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a rait," he said.
As well as Convercent offers your software as a service, and enterprises are charged with repeated taxes for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million when financed in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was accommodated to $47 million.
Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and acquired all its finance of $60 million.
These investments are not surprising because of the networked nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s workers expect more than until now.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high gardens and interesting projects are only units.
The workers want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, they feel that they hear their voices, and that the work you do are paying, they feel more committed to make this company," Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Effects and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which also uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors get rendites when their portfolio enterprises run well. Companys run well when employers are engaged and engaged.
If the Analytics Tools thirds promise to increase commitment and use of the employees, it is not wonderful that you find support.
The data on the worker engagement are important after the experts of the workplace culture.
But the data are unusual if the managers of a company do not take any measures.
In fact, if an employer asks your feedback, it may have a expectation that the change is on the way.
And if the change doesn't come quickly, or at all, this disturbance can distort and demotive employees.
"If you ask for 4.000 appointments, you must be ready to have 4.000 talks," said Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Cotter International, who has seen companies who have left too much on the data collection.
"And if you don't follow the workers, you're really listening to me?
Do you care about that?
And who do you not care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is currently conducting monthly workers inquiries, was able to implement measures on the same day when a problem is reported on the clint, so Errett.
And after the collection of feedback of frustrated workers, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communicating training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new views of the employees, and it hopes that in a long view, this leads to a better link of employees in a broadcast that is for high ranges.
"If you are not committed to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Brunes
It is about 23 hours when a lot of UCLA football players are discussed on a side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus.
Some have exposed their tricotober parts and show the backs of full switch from the first day of the trainer.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a midday pause.
Players who are registered in the summary sources will return to their final tests after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6:30.
"This is a real treasure for the guys next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday became on Monday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the end of Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of UCLA should be started at 19:15 to be justified by the already packaging time plans of the players.
The compromise is from the two days more than one day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season, and during the Sommer School the first time during Moras six games in Westwood practical practices.
They will stop during August 18 exercises. 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparation for their opposition against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he underlined the change of the NCAA, even if it adds another point to the players' multi-occuped routes.
"We put this great burden on it three or four days, and it's very exciting," said Mora.
"And they've just crossed it, they're going on, they're good people.
I think, as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be easily assigned to a higher class hotel that has already been tested with footballs that run a protective network behind a towerpot.
Bruins players want to place the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We'll use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it isn't far to think that people are in a room and then put up an exercise.
If you have the video band of an exercise, it's a pretty business.
But we have security forces in there, and we have security forces on parking place 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
That's why I don't worry too much.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify the test of facts in the fight against elderly messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party auditors and then show their results under the original contribution, the worldwide largest online-social network said on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to fight fake news.
The company said in an opinion on his website that it would begin using updated machine learning methods to recognize possible false notifications and to send them to verifyers that may be shown the results of the test from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for the fake news that many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a great political issue in Europe, where the French electors were overcome in the context of the presidential elections in May with false stories, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks, if they do not want to quickly eliminate hated postings as before the elections in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate claim to Germany that in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new verification will be started.
"Besides the knowledge of the stories of reviewers of parties, people want more context to make funded decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, the product manager for Facebook messages in a blog.
You add that Facebook will continue to test its feature of the "connected article" and other changes in Property-Feed to reduce false messages.
Create a comic-Roman: a lock in the history of England
In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was to see in a Squee-Music Video and was a shopping for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has 700 years of turbulent story of Â mighty seats in Be日 River Tal in Kent and has now become inspired for a graphical Roman of Jamie Rhodes, a mopharic Yorkshireman with a love for historical documents.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years," he says weakly.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' declines the time from the centuries to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May . William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotional.
"I just reacted on the pressure on the side of a letter, which was written by a doppel layer in the 1700s, which was for the Jacobs," he said.
"This is his damn impression!
And the letters are always riding by smoke, for then a fire was burned because of the light.
For someone who is 300 years later, the Church has a effect as if he himself was.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so covered with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Art of Council of England and lived almost four months in a close ("To be honest: I have a little overestimated my welfare") seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodos delivered his days to announce the victorian "new" closs, to view the archives and to study the many lock's curiosities, such as the mounted hyenen heads on the walls and the flashes that had passed for centuries in the grave.
He turned through the landscape and the ruins of the old village and talked to farmers, gardens, and sometimes also with artists who are at the illustration of his book.
Then the night he drunk "Whiskey and began to write."
The intime story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received the full access to 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived for a year later, the employees just began to take care of the archive that he wrote as "Highs of years in which aristocrates said "Oh, wear it on the dachbodes".
Daily books, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards, which represent what he sat: "You might think that land conflicts would be long-term," says Rhodes, "but there was a bird to fight the two families.
Guys, let everything go."
Some of the stories in the assembly use the village as a starting point to include on the larger basis in the English history, including the 'The Labourer' following a man who leaves the new builded village to join the building up of 1381.
"There is a record of a treasurer who comes 1380 in the closure, in this book with the title 'Knightly familys of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The building rebellion started in this area, and I thought that a rebellion was a good beginning.
Maybe the two are connected together?"
Other stories are stumbled in the story of the lock - such as the "Priest" who told the history of the Jessian patter, which Darrell's family hided seven years during the English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the Smuggler Arthur Darrell is presented from the 18th century, installing his own sepulchment by shaving a scarce with stones (a discovery that was made first years later, when his sad was buried).
The Darrells are Rhodes' Lovelings family of Scotney: "The lords seemed to be quite guilty, always committing debt and spending money for things that they couldn't be allowed.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I suggest them as a lot of good looking boys, with a talent to join."
After the end of his use in the closure, Rhodes is searching for other unique write-effects
He brought a two-week stay in the Finnish Wildney for a comic-Roman over Elämanm, the area of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was then requested by the nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was trist to go again," he said.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to be done again with the fucking life."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old marine capelle in Rhöndorf
With the prevention of the 301 years old marine capelle in Rhöndorf, the city Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new dachmark (Rundshow of Thursday).
By Thursday, citizens Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team about Nelson Artz want to keep the Logo and Slogan secret.
On the end of August, the campaign will have a festival on the island of Grafenworth.
"Too good for us.
Or?", the Maker of the action asked the places on the Rhöndorfer Capelle since yesterday.
"We don't think this (otherwise!) really," they write on their free website yesterday.
"But we use this action to win your attention.
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems.
In fact, we are the firm conviction that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know about the beauty and attraction of our city."
The action is about more than "only" a logo and a Slogan, it continues.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one who gives the city an unchanged only-configuring character."
They are in competition with other communities.
A middle five-scale amount is able to cost the city Bad Honnef its new dachmark and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogans before the army
Each year the beginning of August is based on pensions and transportation in the Officier Corps in Ankara of the Master Military Council (YAS).
Like this week.
On the first corner, a normal process.
But nothing is Routine at the Turkish fighting forces one year after the putch trial.
The meeting was no longer located in the building of the General Stab, as before, but at the Office of the Minister.
In the consultations, the President of the Government has now participated in the five vicepresidents and the Minister for Defence, Internal, Justice and External Ministry.
This is how the civilians in YAS were overall.
The Government is in the military.
Although the General Chairman Hulusi Akar remains in the office, the commanders of the Army, the air forces and the marine have been abandoned.
Since the coup failed, the Governing Boss Erdogan 169 of the 326 generals and admirals has earned.
More than 100,000 soldiers were removed from the army series - mostly because of the ambiguous connections to the movement of the Exil Preacher Fethullah Gulen, the Erdogan looks as a draftsman of the puzzle trial.
In contrast to 486 persons who would have been directly shared in the puzzle trial, it has been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
On the day after the putsch, Erdogan had made the temptation as "God's gift" because he gave him the opportunity to clean the fighting forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army?
On the end of February, the magazine "Hürriyet" published an article with the title "Unbehaviour in the military headquarters".
In the general stab, there are concerns for a lasting "islamization" of the army, which, inter alia, appears in the derogation of the soldiers' head-up prohibition, wrote the magazine.
Great purification in armies and security forces continues at any time.
In the middle of July, Erdogan for decree feeded more than 95 public servants, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed to be like Erdogan was cut off the military.
The generals were deceived before the gentlemen of the country.
Three times, they put their role as guardians of the World State Regulation.
Following the election 2002, Erdogan rejected the power of the military step to step, not too late, by vocation to the reforms of the European Union.
Earlier officers say, Erdogan tribe aims a islamization of the fighting forces forward.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" a non-numerated officer warned, who looked forward to the purchase trial in the foreign Asyl, the Turkish army will be "complete extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this happens, such development could not allow the Nato to be cold.
Without prejudice, there are doubts in the Allianz after cleaning in the use of the Turkish Army.
The driving structures and operational skills are "depressed", Nato diplomates say.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
It will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He intends to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stronger provisions for the achievement of visa for a timely labour authorisation and restrictions for family-oriented visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft legislation should be discussed in the two rooms of the Congress.
"This law will reduce the poverty, increase the salaries and save billions for tax payers and will do this by changing the way the United States will be issued to the citizens from other countries of Green Cards."
The law will prevent Ketten migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates speaking English with the financial funds to show themselves and knowledge that will benefit from our economy," Trump, quoted by the media.
Ministry wants to sane streaks for rental huttle
It has always been attacked in the past months about the future of the springshouttle - now it's gonna go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it will be built on the marode streak on which the tourist roads are running.
In order to ensure the future of a long-term roadhouse, the construction work should be started in this year, according to the information of the Ministry of Construction.
"As the decision to continue the stream of Ilmenau renewment and sanction, the country is in particular known to this important connection for tourism," explained the Foreign State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The costs for the establishment of the streams were about 2,5 million euros.
From this sum, the country is 75 Pro.
The Treaty, on which the Shuttle is to be established in the future of the country, is currently finally agreed, explained.
The Ministry and the South Thuring Travel as operators have already agreed with the technical details.
"This is the vehicle plan, the vehicles used and the quality standards," said Shall.
The planned Treaty between the Ministry and the Travel Society will be closed for a period of 11 years.
This should be reported regularly in December 2017.
The Renstop Shuttle is a particularly popular travel connection in tourists between the towns Ilmenau and the rental station.
In the past months, a pilot manager was tested whether the streak of sufficient many people will be sufficient to reorder them regularly in the future.
The streak is also strongly constructive in parts.
The growth of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
As you thought that it couldn't be foolish in 2017, a new report on the ambitional developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are currently a big thing.
Recently, the Fund for Responsible Robotics (France for Responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to EEC years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emerging professor for robotics and artistic intellectuality at the University of Sheffield and the FRR, we must begin to take their growth seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of brushers and the type of fingerprints.
"The people make themselves fun about them, but the companies provide all of them, and we will see them more often," Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report.
Modern exhausts have developed from their inflammable partners to robots with a silicone who feels heavy - with conscious human reactions reached by the artistic intellectuality.
The user can also adjust his robots according to his convictions and select everything, from the eye color of the robot over the form of the brushes to the type or colour of its figs.
But it will be more disturbing, since many robots would have the "Personalities" that would have seen a Stepford wife progressively.
Modern exposures have developed to robots with a silicone hut.
The RealBotix Roboter, for example, allows his users to adapt their robots to the properties they find correspondingly, such as sharkness.
And then there are still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with preferred personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which provides the impression of sharkness and "Wild Wendy" with a "aventuous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," the True Companion website warms.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has its votes - just as real people!
She may be silent, fixed on conversation or she can be "in vote"!
There are many disturbing aspects in this growth of sexual robots - not allowed because they replace real human relations - but the needed women's properties, the advice on administration, if you have a step on Frigid (that is: opposing) Farrah, they are insulting one of the most.
On his website compare True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"When women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not only a fetic or holding a different sex game.
Their decline and their low raffines show something dark and deep in our culture, to a turn from the idea of the equality of the gentlemen to a desire after sex with an optional advantage.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR observes their growing popularity, they remain temporarily at the border of consumption.
But what looks out of the margin zones can be very learning about the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or wise until the free market is permitted to them.
There is a certain surprise that these highly developed sex robots in a time where women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has proposed to have sexually attacked women.
The most terrible aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of Magd') is not the graphical images, the corrupt body and the exhausted eyes, but how realistic this vision affects.
The Republic of Gilead is a sprung, but this does not feel like a big sprung at the moment.
The objective behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to real women as realistically and technically possible (if with pornosar proportions).
Their builders want to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, on the point, when it's about their personality, the robots do not have real women.
You can't separate or simply go away from your partner.
You have no mixture or a background story, nothing that hinders of independence or something that could be the fantasy of total interview.
Otherwise: You are adequate slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 statement: Services
Trumps great power?
He makes Mitt Romney to understand the healthy human understanding
It has become an insight of the Trump era that the political splits that have polarized the US election have also split families in small formats.
In the United States there were newspapers with advice about how to handle the horror of Trump.
We strive all around to place our filter blades.
Less noted is the power of Trumps to gather families.
I am telling this because my cousin, a left-oriented girl, who has been busy in Chicago le¤ and has been working with the Republicans in our family, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that the unit against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows, is the Republican community with which she has been fighting for years because of the Property is suddenly and totally owned on the same side.
For the Eastish, it is certainly a simple thing, but it is in another context that this also brings significant risks to it.
The link was strengthened by Trump, but the exciting effect of his presidentiality has the power to move us all to the right.
When we talk about "Normalization" and Trump, we relate to the terrible possibility that his feet of one day will not be disrupted.
However, there is a more terrified long-term scenario in the Trump Republican of the Right Flight "normalised", which suddenly appears in comparison with its standards as a sense of understanding.
I find me today from an active nostalgie for the Urquem version of the foolish - the dog on the car, 14% of the income tax (but at least we knew how his tax clothes appeared) - both, compared to Trump, actually, occurred as a very mild penalty.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy only to qualify as an inevitable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we held our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the Karussells of the New Yorker Park Department, and the best three of them you can eject in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are extremely large, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crazy and the animals turn to look fullly over their own wallets - extremely dark and the climbing music provides this in a wonderful way.
So many closes of a city deceive: The views of high buildings are old to be trusted by the Skylines to offer a lot of rebellion, and the reality of the city will not be justified by the dream.
Fifty years later, and I'm still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big circulation in North London.
However, the Central Park Carussel is still a strange magic experience, since here two years old, one 11 years old and two women in the 40s and everyone has a good time.
If I could evaluate the Carussell, I would have given him the full number of points, but for lucky, no one asked it.
On the other hand, in this week, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could carry my credit card.
In the coffee house at my road corner, it is the same, plus the option to compare the assessment with a 15% drink payment - this is to buy something over the ladentic.
This leads not only to a delay of what should be a neutral exchange, but also to press on the server to introduce personality into a situation where it is not necessary.
The poor woman in the purchase was excusing, while I needed to make the experience to give you my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius sent to the hospital with breast pain
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
In the past year, he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of snippets to his handhelds, which he took after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was condemned by murder after an appointment of the State advocate against a first murder court.
He killed Steencamp in the early morning of the Valentine Day of 2013, shooting on them several times through a door of the toilet cabin inside the house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he felt his friend to be a nightmare who hid himself in the cabine.
The State advocates have announced their intention to put this time against the six-year prison penalty of Pistorius Appell, which they say it is too careful.
The National Criminal Prosecutor said that it would be raised in the Chief Court of South Africa, and that the commitment could be heard in this year.
Pistorius acts that his penalty will be increased for 15 years when the states are.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a wonderful egg
As the last of the Blumberger Schools, the fourth closes were released from feet and oven hops to the vacation and to the continued schools.
Three of the students are willing to go to the gymnasium, four to the real school.
Leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the home of the home of Biesental in Epfenhoven.
As a symbol for school exemption, the 29 students of the four classs chose a young adler under the leading of So≤a Schumacher and Regine Meder, but then will be released into freedom.
To this, the monster shar led a music with the title "The Adler in the coast".
Bauer Arnold found a wonderful egg, and left it out of his kitchens.
Instead of a kitchen, a little adler came out.
However, the hope to make a fucking hole of him was broken, the Adler spread his flights on a high mountain and disappeared.
Following the three and four classes, Yvonne Frank showed a shot tank in the study.
The hairs danced with the young gockles that carryed cylinders for the law.
The adler stands for the integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other little animals (cookies), it belongs to it.
But he will never be like a fuck.
His decree is to be free.
She wanted every quarter to feel accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the former leader Michael Mâmer, who continues to enter into educational steps, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen's time is over now, explained class teacher So月a Schumacher.
She leaves her students learning only very unfortunately after two years, because it was a really good time.
Finally, they could leave themselves on the fourth clases.
To conclude, all students made a song of summer and holiday.
This is a great joy in the children.
The new school year has already been reported eight first-classes.
Two Bulgarians found for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested because of illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of External Affairs, quoted by television, shared with.
On the morning of 1 August, the police was found in Sithonia a group of illegal criminals, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released while a study is currently running.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have enhanced the control of the free camp and make everyone who is found to stay at a place that has not been intended for this purpose a significant penalty.
The controls are continued during the whole season.
The Ministry said that the Court could commit a penalty.
Software Updates for Diesel vehicles: What the people need to know now
How exactly does the software update find place?
Should Diesel Factors share in the action?
The main questions and answers in the review.
At Diel-Gipfels, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-concerns offered software updates for around 5,3 million cars.
They will improve the deal of gas cars of emission classes EUR 5 and partly EUR 6.
Euro-4-partial or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe provides estimates:
Is the new action obligatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The commitmental updates first apply only to the vehicles that have shooting software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their carriage has arranged the power carriage boundshop (KBA).
How and from what customers are informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced an appropriate implementation in the following months, but not yet called a exact date.
Daimler told each person to write.
If an inspection is without prejudice, it will be carried out in their framework.
How long should the engineering take place in total?
"Sweet to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of producers and political pressure.
"Then we have seen that the car manufacturers are not voluntary to act on the environment."
How long the update should take
The recycling itself could only take three to four hours in the workplace.
The timemaker may be to get a date.
What do cars do not car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW container?
The ACE is advised to wait.
Perhaps foreign producers would follow, like Smetanin.
Does a massive price loss of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE protects this.
But even in the regions where carrying forbidden.
In the rural room there is no loss of value for older diesel until now.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.
◆ Cool J receive Kennedy Center exhibition
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamous events in Washington.
The first price delivery under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the prices doesn't want to come from Protest.
✔ Cool J (49) is received as the first rapper one of the requested exhibitions of the renamed Kennedy Center.
Like the culture institution on Thursday, this year also belongs to Sanggerin Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as the coreographic Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV-product Norman Lear (95).
The exhibitions will be submitted on the beginning of December.
Traditionally, the US President Donald Trump will make a receipt and participate in the deliveration with his wife Melania.
As a result, Lear has already announced that the pricemaker with progressive TV series had already been invited to dismiss the participation of the Gala.
The New York Times said, "This presidency has decided to completely reduce the arts and human rights -- even to remove the funds - and that is what makes me burden."
The 59-year-old Estefan showed that she would use the talk with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Centre, named John F. Kennedy, is the most cultural institution in the United States Haft City.
Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We're making the city alive
Roland Wacker, Haslach's town treasure, goes to the round next year.
The body is already written - the appropriate applicants are rare.
Since 31 years, Wacker is a city treasure.
And the work still makes him a great pleasure, as he provides in the press talk.
He reports of differentiation, but also requesting tasks that wait for his followers.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has been given to the request profile until now.
The city looks for a architect or building.
Thus, under the regular announcement periods, it must be sufficient time for an integration.
Since Haslach works as a lower building member of the community, the applicant must submit the corresponding derogations.
Because this function wants to keep the city anyway.
If they were not able to comply with them anymore, the citizens should take advice to Offenburg.
But citizens are important to the city and his own, says Wacker, reporting of a good operational climate and a good vote between the authorities and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in the Office, some important projects have been gathered together, looking back to the waker with stupidity.
"We make the city vital," he's safe about the building and his workers.
But in the future, there are many different projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the neighbourhood park is approximately executed.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium anaging is still a subject.
Only the last one will be thrown up with about 1,5 million euros to books, "if we do it right," it appreciates wacker.
"All of us are waiting for good tasks to my followers.
The work here makes fun."
Manufacturing to be available for a city treasure of a large game room.
Haslach’s own building and gardenship can be reacted very flexiblely.
"You can move a lot," so wacker, and the design of the green facilities is often honored by citizens and citizens.
Since the old city is under mind protection, it is important to have "a eye for what is fitting" when new builders are approved, the separate city treasure points out.
Without prejudice, the city treasure has high responsibility.
He's Bauherr, "the end of all of this is running over my table."
In the maintenance and coordination, he can count on long-year workers: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with Manfred Schöner (Tief Building) since 15 years.
Although his follower remains long, he wants to wacker: "We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified with the place."
Because the continuity is not only important for a operational climate but also for the further building of the city.
Whoever wants to bear Roland Wacker should, after the outcome of the city of Haslach, be able to provide a complete Property as a diplomatic or Bachelor with expertise Architecture and have expertise in the areas of building and building planning.
The building of the city is supported by high and deep building, building planning, basic businesses, administration of the state's properties, the town's business office with building and town's garden, as well as the low building rights belonging to the mental protection.
Road on guidelines: South Road locked
According to the police, the unrecognized teasers had made the blue driving road from the train transfer in the Leobener Street (B116) to the guides.
These were so strongly advised that the goods were to be paid.
The investigators come out of two men's teeth and look for them since the nighttime.
Near the tatort were observed by the Witnesses a rosaroter Roller and a road-fair.
"It's going far out of a bubble street," said the OBBB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The one or the teasers would have taken themselves into a large position and also have made it possible for the movement.
Besides the damage on the lock and the installation, as well as the late minutes and the costs for the shine trading, even the pools of the train channels can be reached to the wallets.
The speaker said that it was totally to go out of a "essential" sum.
The damage was rearranged on Friday afternoon, the traveling on the southern road was able to be carried out without prejudice.
Knapp → Personal trains were seen on Friday morning, two of them related to television.
The goods were not out, but they had late.
According to OBB speakers Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of surroundings were to be exchanged.
Isolators and masters were also protected.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to reduce IBD (inflammational disorders)
Red meat and chocolate can sound for your duration system like an alptraum.
But a new responsibility claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich on meat-based proteins and milk products may reduce the symptoms of patients with inflammational disorders.
The inadequate state in the United States of about 1,3 million and in the United States 300,000 causes magnestry and bleeding, repeated or blue transactions, weight loss and extreme deterioration.
In the case of the concerned, it is usually intended to meet meat and milk products to reduce their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid triptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune numbers that promote a tolerant darm.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunition patterns in the darm to ensure that damage microbes who hide themselves in eating are not entered into the body.
Cells that are able to solve fuel will be equipped from cells that promote the tolerance and cut the body without prejudice to obtainable weights.
If the equivalent is too far in the direction of burning, it can result in an inflammational inflammation.
In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance promotes immunition in mouse, which is a certain bacteria in their injections.
And the bacteria needs tryptophan - one of the protein buildings - to solve the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have made a connection between a kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus re日i - which is a normal part of Darm microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
More than tryptophan had the mouse in their neighborhood, more they had of these immune numbers."
He proposed that the combination of L. re日i and one to tryptophan rich food is tolerant, less inflammable darm miles, if the same system also works in humans.
The post-doctorian Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune that promotes the tolerance when she discovered that a group of muscles had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but was undertaken, which had not.
She believed that the subsheed had to do with the darm microbiomes of the mouse - the community of bacteria, viruss and pills that usually live in magnetic darm traction.
The muscles were sequenced by DNA and have been found six bacteria types that were available in the mouse with the immune numbers, but without them were missing at the mouse.
Mouses were opened in a sterile environment so that they missed a darm microbium and they did not develop this kind of immune, and they received the L. re日i and the immune numbers.
To understand how the bacteria were affected on the immune system, the researchers L. re日i grew up in a liquidity and then transferred small quantities of liquidity - without the bacteria - to unreasonable immunition isolated by the mouse.
The immune numbers developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquidity, it was shown as a subproduct of the tryptophan metabolism, which is indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse feeding, the number of these cells increased about 50%, but when the triptophan values were half, the number of cells fell around the half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as the mouse, and that most of us are L. re±i in our magen-Darm traces.
It is not possible that tryptophan-new products from L. reʹi develop the cells in humans as well as in mouse, but in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammation.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells are controlling burning on the inner surface of the darm.
Potentially high triptophan values can lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "Genie"
Manchester United signed a "gene" with Maenya Matic, Jose Mourinho believed after the Mediterranean player had his debt against Sampdoria.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-session game before the EUFA-Super-Cup starts on Thursday against Real Madrid, and impressively in the holder role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were formed after people.
Matic, however, was excluded by the Blues Preparation-Asia Tournee and created only 45 minutes, which Mourinho concluded that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League-Saison.
"He takes time, but his experience, intellectuality, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks of football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him to be ready before than later."
Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the aviva station, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Inde enth in this week that Mourinho wanted three further new commitments, but he said that the club had already made a "fair work" to fulfil three of his four priority commitments.
"Tree of four, thanks to the unit," he added.
"I'll be more happy if they get four of four for me, but they have given great effort."
Boeing "malt" dreamliners in heaven
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the silhouette of a dreamliner in heaven.
The pilots fled from Seattle in Washington, but the drawing started in Marquette in the USA Michigan and went in the form of a dreamliner over the United States, which is a thousand miles.
The action was 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole was a test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such publicity before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing Logo was drawn into heaven.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still a head of SPD, social democratic presidents always looked at elections with a certain concern to Berlin.
Unless there is no fire from the partial trail, only no contrawind from the band - the most important desire of the electors was.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, it has changed basically.
Since then, the workers from the Willy Brandt House watched the events in the SPD Governed Countries.
What school has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with the opposite.
There were deep shoes.
And one after the other.
The Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against SPD and Green coalitions after the surprising end of the red-green majority in the Netherlands.
"It shows more: Red-green can simply not be confidently governed," said CDU general secretary Peter Tauber to the German Editor Network (RND).
The surprising exhibition of a Green Deputy has caused the Government of Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a serious crisis.
Five months before the landday choice, its red-green coalition lost its majority of votes to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Bounds Business Leader Michael Kellner invited the Netherlands Green-Green Deputy to return their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear error of the electoral will.
Each question must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Business leader and election campaigns of the Green to the EditorsNetwork Germany (RND).
"It can't be true," a SPD elector, when the new Jobsboth has reached the partitional trale on Friday.
Stephan Weil, SPD Ministry of the Netherlands, is there after the overcome of the Green Deputy Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the temporary point of a whole range of large and small crisis in SPD countries.
And no one knows what happens next.
The mistress began with the unexpected clear delay at the Saarland election in the market.
A blue eye, no longer, was the joy of his time.
After the landscapes in Schleswig-Holstein and Northern Rhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
That has become - and, even though everything has become clearly worse.
The download in Kiel holded the SPD into the tables, the Düsseldorf-Pleite higher the party.
In the weeks later, the gentlemen repeatedly remembered.
Then, when they just made new courage, the G-20-Gipfel came from Hamburg.
And the next depth came with him.
Citizen Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country head, lost his Nimbus on that week because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city.
And because he did so much wrong in the crisis communication after that, what you could do is wrong.
Since then, Scholz has struggled with his political survival.
Now and Stephan Weil.
Because of the U.S.A. and its role in the Supervisory Council, the Netherlands Ministry has already been critical.
Miscellaneous survey values arrived.
Nevertheless, or maybe just that, trying for the past weeks more stronger to put in the Bund accents.
The effort of the former citizen of Hannover to build his power in Berlin was also not hidden in the area of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to give him because they deal with a stability of the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
This is because of the part of the part of the Netherlands Green, in fact, it does not have any fault.
And the school isn't anymore.
Unfortunately, the joys are trying to keep their own orders closed.
Their wrath is addressed to the Green, and in particular to the deteriorated Parliament's question.
"It is inevitable and democrative, as Mrs. Twesten puts its own care interests on the interests of all others," said Matthias Miersch, Chief of the Participants in the SPD Boundday Group, the Editoring Network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been chosen as direct candidate, but on the list of the Netherlands Green Green in Parliament, so the Law Deputy continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returned her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Chief of the SPD Bounding Group, is sorry for a "unemocratic manover".
"The electoral willy four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil to the Minister," Opermann, who leads the low-school SPD as a spectacular candidate to the UK.
"Now, the personal carrier thinking of a future CDU lawyer deputy fails the choice result," Opermann continued.
He requested to clear the backwards.
I want to know if there was more or that the CDU's continued claims have been given.
Awards for the posts III
Whoever wants to be healthy in the years of the country can be supported.
The citizen Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG were informed of the middle-week town development in receipts.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler again gave a look at the event until now.
Since 1991, it has been given in receiving sanction areas.
At that time, in the sanction area I of 1991 to 2004, the country had taken two thirds of the contributions.
In the sanction area II of 2005 to 2016, the aid remained at 60 Pro.
For Schindler, the current sanctions are a "success project" - it is important to promote the internal development, not only to include new building areas.
On 4 April, the President Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a sanction area III.
The amount of contributions is 833 333 euros, which is 500 000 euros from the country, which is from the Community receipts.
How is there a sanction area now?
You're going to continue to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
But it also plays a role in sanitary health in the planned area.
In the case of cases, the area limits could be moved again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel at Middle-Work.
Keller presented the contents of the "Social City" programme in which the sanctions would be carried out.
The framework of the programme is the revitalisation of internal sites, the improvement of residence and work and the maintenance and the development of infrastructure.
The measures would have been implemented, namely by baseline.
The sanction area would then be defined as a statute.
The authorisation period for the awards is running from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the summary would be carried out only once in the context of which the shared in the sanction area would have received a questionnaire to comply.
The decision of the statute shall be taken as far as possible in November or December so that sanctions may be started in the next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each community must perform the investigations provided for for forab.
It is going to evaluate and decide the urban disasters when he is cured and in what way.
It will also be included in the basic book for the basic element.
Pitzschman will come to receipt again and make a picture of the situation, speaking it.
Gotzel pointed out that a major success factor for the project was the contribution of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questions that will be postally sent to the citizens in the next weeks and to be released until the end of the summer party.
The yellow questionbook is the "building and basic box", which includes the building and sanctional purposes.
In the green questionbook, the "Containing and Apartment box", information can be made on size, distribution and residents of an apartment.
The blue "building box" is to be filled only when business rooms are running in the building.
However, it is to be considered how Gotzel pointed out that an issued questionnaire is not at the same time a request for assets.
In addition, rebuilding measures are not supportable.
Schindler also pointed out that the distribution of the awards works after the "Windhundprin" - who comes first, it's first.
You can't reserve payments for later.
On the end, more photos of the "Location II" project were shown to make the presents a sanction "smackful".
British finder places himself a microchip to come with a hand move in house and car
A British finder is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip to open his home door, access his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the winning chip between daumen and show fingers and now offered the service for companies and individuals who wanted to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined himself with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advising anaestheist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implantation process is conducted according to medical standards.
Technology is like a cat and dog implanted microchip and only takes 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the lockers to houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a bill of £ 300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built both home and at Property BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on tax.
The advertising of the White House costs the thousands of tax payers
The decision of the White House to flight a Marine-Huber to South Lawn for a event that shows the `ananish performance last month' cost tax payers according to the information of the military delivered to the TIME magazine up to $24,000.
The Green-White Sikorsky VH-3D, as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart piece of the event on 17 July in the White House with building programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and leader of the white House made an access to products from all 50 countries.
The hub shooter prepared in Connecticut was issued near a yacht, a firewall from Wisconsin and a Mississippi wallet stapler.
The military office of the white House requested the presence of the hubshooter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, nearly 36 hours before the shooter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the hubshawker.
"I just wanted you to be conscious of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the committee of HMX-1 at the previous evening of the event, represented by the presidential Marine Commander for Airport.
The message showed that the shooter came on 17 July at 7 hours tomorrow on the South Lawn for the event at 15 hours, and remained until the race was released between 18:00 and 21:00 this evening.
The note (f) indicates that if the flight should be removed from the White House, the limitation of the service times would require a second flight membership.
The original aircraft was located during the event in the aircraft, while the unit's security staff remained on the ground at the aircraft during the time.
The records provided by the TIME were not clear whether a second flight is required.
The Ha ́ Act prohibits federal employees to use public property for political purposes.
Data lines show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could lose the destination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a damage of the Ha ́ Act and we were informed that this wasn't the case," wrote the commander.
"It sounds like you're closed," answered the stuck-representative commander.
The event "Made in America" was covered by the White House as official event and wouldn't be covered by the Act.
But also of official events have political overseers.
In the event, the Chairman gave an approach to the reform of the health reform, which was in the senate, and extended the efforts to determine government rules.
The use of the aircraft, which is Marine One or Air Force One, for political beneficial purposes is almost a new phenomenon.
The Presidents are binding to use them for the travel.
But to ask for their use only for a photo-OP, it is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the Chairman's first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, Taxi Services, and his Twitter account is full of notices that demand the use of the Chairman's aircraft by his leaders.
"The White House is awesome by the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 countries showed by workers of ananas with materials," said the white House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 posts often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to put the US presidents in the White House with precise centimeter rates.
When the Trump was beginning July on the G20-Gipfel in Germany, HMX-1 was conducted in the white house 58 practices.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was counted on the need for training for the moon, said an employer.
Helicopter units have passed 11 hours on this day for "No Presidency Sub-Emissions".
The White House said that the tax payers received the charge for no other requisitors presented in the event.
A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company was not assigned to make the hub screwman on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not contain budget records for the President's flights, and it is difficult to determine the precise costs for the event.
According to the U.S. Defence Minister for the financial year 2017, however, the DoD refund rates for VH-3D are 24.380 USD per flight hour.
Records of the unit decline the flight time of the flight as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House arguments that the actual costs for the operation of the rubber are far under this rate.
"The costs for tax payers based on refund rates are most irrelevant," said Walters.
"They include personal, storage and many other hidden costs contained in the annual resources."
According to a RAND study from 2015, the refund rules for DoD contain not the personal characteristics, but take into account the costs for carrying, storage and contract conclusions.
At that time, the former press speaker of the white House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the hub shooter for the event.
"The idea is to present these weekly things produced in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Bundesstat Connecticut are very proud of that they are involved in our national security, and I am determined that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think, as most Americans, we are all surprised of the hardware and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have been unnecessary.
Of course, it is appropriate to highlight it."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the hub-shooter when he met his arrival over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in a firewall seat.
In the white house, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and shot with the media over his own float of business products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss in front of a painful task
The head of the second tennis-boundsliga is attended in the third table search Dorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow from 11 hours in Kiel at the third board search Dorfer SV.
Despite five parties still makelozer Bi, the head of the second Tennis-Bundesliga has received the sense of reality.
The team of Marius Zay has any respect for the enemy.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar form.
Just on the behind positions, I find the community very well."
For class and stability in the SV search Dorfer, especially imports from the high north are provided.
"Your Danish and finds can even refer to ones in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the duplicate," Zay says with a shock on Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Switzerland), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It will always be hard for us.
There you also need a lot of happiness."
The new community for the travel in the high north is practical.
His debt for blue white could give Maxime Janvier.
If it is not the currently active French in the Challenger Turnier in the Italian Biella, the Zdenek Kolar (Check) playing in the Czech Library will come to the first use in this season.
The inhabited Chilene Hans Podlipnik Castillo was last night with the white Russian Andrei Vasilevski, even at the ATP tourner in Kitzbuttle in the ball.
But he should be also in Kiel like Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (because Netherlands) and Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins on the past Sunday against the Alster Club, Maté Valkusz could also turn back to the team.
Not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was the number of one of the Junior-Welt-List in January 2016, someone from the tragedy stab on Marius Zay's side.
How America can damage the OMV
In fact, Donald Trump did not act when he put his signature in the middle of the Middle Wednesday under the Law on the deterioration of the sanctions against Russia.
"In his hate to adopt the law," the Congress made a few "constitutional rules" packages, he eated.
Even the reaction from Moscow was so low as expected, and even brussel was struck against the US progress.
The draft is always expected to punish companies that help the Russian to build gas pipelines in the EU.
Compliantly, investors of the home OMV are financed together with other companies to build the Russian East Sea Guide North Stream 2.
The Drohkulis is great.
However, it is too early to evaluate the consequences such as the official statement of the oil conservation.
In fact, Donald Trump himself must resurrect the sanctions still by executive order for life.
Twelve weapons are in his choice.
The "Press" has seen what the concerns could deteriorate and who could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Paul, the Cali Cartel will be put into the middle of Netflix
Despite the second staff of Narcos, which enthies Paul's killer, the series of Netflix is not long ago.
The staffs three and four have already been employed by the Streaming Ser, which first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weight of the show.
With the staff, the DEA has addressed its attention to the most rich organization of the world trade: the Cali Cartell.
As indicated by four powerful patterns, they operate "as a fortune-500 undertakings" only with more state deficiencies and violent action.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the Cartells, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) orders mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type, the criminal and coöpyanian prosecutors, in order to submit the war against.
More new show players are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The Narcos's staff will be started on 1 September.
Role Return: The city sets 46 kitchen helps
The city reorganizes the kine middlest again.
With firm meeting partners for children and a team assignment.
In the towns of children's day, the hour is returned.
By 1 September, the town Krefeld takes the food supply in the towns of children's day (Kitas) in its own region.
For Sonja Pommeranz, headquarters in the field of youth assistance, this is a message: "We all have been very happy."
Cooked is continued outside the house: A cater takes this task and provides fresh kitchen.
The city is in the crossfield area 46 children's days, and in 44 the children receive a warm feed.
In the past year, about 2800 children were sitting on the table, and the need was continually.
"The middle time is not only children who are spent 45 weeks in the middle-day kitchen," said Pommeranz.
"This boat also applies in the 35-hour deal, when children remain until 14 hours."
46 part-time forces have a kitchen service since 1 September: they have taken the angelic food, added them to salat, rock and fruit, share the feeding time individually, give eating, release, shopping and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kit," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups like seven groups - decides about the time range.
"The kitchen helpers now belong to the kine team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much stronger connected and it is to apply a simple, pedagogical concept."
For this is also: healthy nutrition and kitchen education.
"The children need to help prepare food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is significant there.
Also for the children.
"You have a powerful power in the Kita, a person who is trusted in them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the kine spaces - too, the task of the kitchen forces - will be accomplished in the future by a special cleaning staff.
This variant - the training of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm that it has been made in comparison with the costs between the own region and the foreign transaction for the city as the most economical, it is from the Presseam.
And that, if 46 part-time forces are re-installed.
"But these hours, about 750 people in education are not so strong in weight," says Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghanistan Democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Elections can only be representative when all members of the society, women, play a role, said the UN mission head in Afghanistan at midweek.
Nicholas Haysom, officer of the United States Mission, said that hundreds of women in the provinces will be candidated. Three women candid for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 per of the newly registered electors are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement midweek.
Elections can only be really representative and credible if women share unlimited and be included in all parts of the election process.
Afghanistan's elections for the Province Council and the presidential elections are located on 5 April.
The Taliban have published an advice against a electoral process that covers the transition of international fighting processes to an advising role.
In this year, the elections will be delivered peacefully from a democracy-elected government to the next time.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghanistan independent election Commission reports that 1,2 million women registered by 3,6 million electors are registered.
Wande’s TV Jubilee
From the 110-year-old existence, the TV carriages introduced to a small wandege with then coffee and kitchen.
The wande ́ starts on Sunday, 9 July, at 13 hours at the water reservation in the American streets.
From there it goes to the airport until night and over the Waldhof back to the water reserve.
The wall is about one half hour.

GMB care about investments in the McVitie Fabric in Glasgow
A company wants to provide a long-term commitment for production in their work in Glasgow by the Managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company has increased investments in the Tollcross standard for the future.
More than 500 employees work in the work that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse near other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than 5 million pounds in the last years.
He agrees that workers and professional representatives would "release to know as first" if their activities were changed.
In a letter to the leaders of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie's requested "remember that the financing for modernization of production lines will not be provided".
GMB-Senior-Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clearity from the General Site Manager on business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross, our members are increasingly concerned.
Geners of families have come here, and the workforces have been strongly on the local community and the Great Room Glassgow, an important pile for human employment in a area with high unemployment and social communication.
Therefore, under the perspective of workplaces, loan and welfare, and in the background of the brexit, the increased livehold costs and the chronic production income, the end of Glassgow has a flowing production presentation in McVitie."
A speaker of Pladis said, "The leader of Tollcross has received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly, since we appreciate the continuous commitment to workers and business providers.
We had a regular meeting two months ago with workers and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed the workers that we, like all companies who are active in an extremely competitive and unsecure economic climate, are currently checking our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
They add: "In the last years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross standard, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as full and complete production systems. If our operations change, the workers and their professional representatives will be the first to learn this."
Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago, Neymar?
The page of La Liga may be interested in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be left in her persecution of Neymar after she has delivered a boat of £ 189 million to solve his license clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the good trip?
The sensational approach has reached the transmission window in summer, because the Ligue 1-Club is ready to break the well-tree word for more than the duplicate of the present mark, while Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United at the past season for 89 million pounds.
After the end, Neymar will be given to the highest player of the world and to the most paid Profi sporter in the world. PSG offers payments of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is wow about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Presence is that the club has always been given to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG President for three years ago?
When Manchester City 2014 announced interest in the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for everyone who wanted to let one of the best players of PSG subscribe.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to let one of our players be understood, this will have the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish Unit's start of this summer's interest in the PSG media player Marco Verratti.
The PSG cleared that they would not allow the international from Italy to travel in any circumstances, and Barcelona could see the effects of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Domspatten report is loaded by Dadst Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger's Court of Justice on the accidents of misuse is charged by Papst Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That means the author and historic Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the injury candal at the Regensburger Court Patten continues to be discussed.
Christian Weisnder, speakers of the Reform Movement "We are Church", explained after publishing the German Presse Agency, he expected from the former Regensburger Bischof and today Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Mungener and from Domcapell Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emerited father Benedikt XVI.
It would serve very much in the view of the Catholic Church if Mâmer and ratizers expressed their deep deduction over their own submissions or their wrong appreciation of the actions.
The Vatican period "Osservatore Romano" criticized that in the reporting on violence in the courts with "double measure".
With regard to the crimes in Regensburg, nobody doubts that it is the "comfortable and confusing acts" which must be punished and prevented in the future; but the "great medial manipulation" is the author Lucetta Scarafia, historic and member of the national Italian bioetics Committee.
"The habit of becoming the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the daily course and prepares the public opinion of keeping it for normal," says Scarafia.
In the interview with the Bayerian Gloria of Thurn and Taxi, the Prince Gloria mentioned: "You are pleased to go to the church and this is a feed."
▪ she pointed out that in her youth, "schools were a very normal pedagogic means" to be completed with fresh children, as I was one."
They thought it was unfair to apply today's standards to previous years, because the world has changed.
In relation to the reports on crimes, the brothers of Papst Georg often reported ratzinger.
The author and historic Michael Hesemann, who, with ratzinger, contained the memory band "My brother of Dad" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," Hesemann says, "but all that had nothing to do with him," he reports the results of the final report.
What is exactly in the 440-page report, which the legal advocate Ulrich Weber has submitted by Bistum Regensburg with the Apple?
In total, 547 Regensburger judge patterns were sexually misuse between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of crimes, 67 court patterns.
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger, who was employed in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "It is therefore possible to conclude that Domcapell Master R. was used in many cases of physical and mental violence.
In the case of high emotionality, the punishing for the students could also be more violent.
However, in contrast, the number of other accused ones shows that many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even a positive memory with him."
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the crime candal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger has been charged by his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "consequences of vital exercise of protection orders in the Regensburger Domspatents" provides a contrary picture of Domcapell Master Georg Ratzinger.
For one time, many students showed his "humanity".
In other cases, he also appears as choleric and perfectionist, who was handicaped of the eighter when a judge was not musical topic performance.
How do you show this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If you do the effort and read all 440 pages a long report from front to behind, you need to ask yourself why the name is Georg Ratzinger.
He is just divided once eight pages, and it is clearly released by any deceit of the mediator or co-wisherance in the terrible cases of sexual misuse.
Moreover, the violent exhibitions in the pre-school had occurred outside its efficiency.
Instead, you can forbid him to learn about it too late or have not taken the first infections too seriously.
The judgment patentgymnasium on which he acted was found by practically all of those asked as - so badly - "Resolution", "heaven" and "best world".
Thus, the wide majority of his student Georg Ratzinger is a very exciting witness, describes him as "warmsix", "belie", "speakable", "competent" and "intelligent", as extremely good teachers, who regularly provided the boys with kitchens, kitchens and bonbons, and "before reserved of kids' cups".
Only a minority was deceived of his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which led to wools.
That he did not only shoot with stones and cast the key binding on the ground, but also distributed orphans and went too frequency boys to the hair or ears, he himself has given it for years ago, deeply endured and forgiving it.
However, his honesty must be said that such training methods were spread in the questional time, in the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as in teachers.
Do you still know such methods of ensuring?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I've also learned this in a world school, a stately gymnasium,
Compared with what it is in this report, which is the negative sexual misuse and the violent exhibitions in the pre-school, they are freely baptized.
There is already a question of whether it is not more to do with his knowledge and his role than Brother of Benedikt XVI, that many media were just cut on him.
In the Bayer paper, many who have never understanded him still work hard.
The truth, however, is: The report is in any way that Georg Ratzinger is exhausting!
In the media, the report was reported very much about the subject of misuse in the Regensburger Courts.
Does Georg Ratzinger also have any development or cohesion in the final report regarding sexual misuse?
Michael Hesemann: Not clearly.
No one of the 67 sexual offences claims to have confidence in the Domain Master.
Not even the parents were shown.
"I never believed to talk to my father or mother about it," said an inquired representative for the others, "I was very penitent."
The real problem in the adjustment of sexual misuse was, but most of the victims were weakened from shame.
If they didn't even trust their parents and sisters, they would certainly not have been a core leader who would have been a coach of the teachers.
How, then, is the role of ratzingers in the case of misuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned teacher said it: "About sexual misuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had been calculated and had been able to stop the respective teacher.
I think it is ... too absolutely absurd, assuming that it calculates him ... bubbles of entertainment or. clearer or even more open than to their parents, internight leaders, confidential teachers etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... incapable."
The report relates to the very clear result: "With the confidence of the students and/or their environment, it could not be performed in the framework of the investigation."
As regards sexual misuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of every community.
Thus, he cannot be able to prevent him or have brought him to show.
Therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name to these present crimes, as it was in some cases.
In the media, many of the "waltexzessen" were read at the rainburgers.
The former Domcapell Master Georg Ratzinger is discussed in the report "Wagshow".
Does he have to live with this promise?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting, everything has been mixed and mixed to a big mistake of sexual misuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of the report, Georg Ratzinger.
However, this is again a misuse of the report.
It is purely cleaned: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Court Paths, between sexual misuse and violence, and, once, we say, other prejudices.
In addition, the report has treated events since 1945, as well as from four years in which Georg Ratzinger was not the Chor leader of the Court Paths.
All the terrible trial phedagogic, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were regularly schicanized and maltrated and laid down undeservedly, all occurred in the pre-school in etershauses and pillars, where really unscanned states had to have been governed.
But with them, Domain Master Georg had nothing to do, because he received the boys in vision only when they were already on the court-patentgymnasium.
It was the way most of the Witnesses showed the subject "pre-school" tabu.
They were just happy to be dismissed and enjoy the so much better treatment and even for many "paradise" states.
What else was on the gymnasium of the court?
Michael Hesemann: Although there had been Diselin, there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report on the conclusion comes, that "much victims appreciate the general humanity of R., and therefore, despite violence, even positive memories with him."
That's what the predecessor has been looking away.
Despite all efforts, however, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported of the situations in the pre-school.
The first time 1970/71, when he started to establish himself and from the works in a school where he was not working and responsible, he would not hear anything (that the Witness) and then again in 1993.
Does Georg Ratzinger conclude the ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, since since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Court of Justice, which even reproduces the report.
In this he indicates that "the pre-school will continue to be practiced."
In view of the negative press publications, he recommended an urgent input.
That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity occurred, when trial punishment was also long forbidden in Bayern.
Before this, they occurred in a legal grauzone, as everyone of us knows.
It was also difficult to consider where the employees might have overcome or dramatised and where the permitted limit was actually exceeded.
But you can't even say he'd always looked away.
That's not right.
First in 1980, the chastisement on schools was also taken in Bayern of ́ell.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxi claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s phedagogical measures to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We speak historicals of the "Fallstrick of the Anachronism", so that it is the way to evaluate the past at the moral levels of today.
That's where the prince is right.
But it does not apply to sexual misuse, which has been disappointed at all times, and not to what has been violated in the pre-school of countervailability and violence to innocent childhoods, that is already far beyond the general time.
That's all very terrible, and I'm glad that it will finally be opened.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His funds for disgusting and punishing, so to drag ears and to the hair and ears, were broad in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also kept strictly on it.
What picture of his Regensburg's time Georg Ratzinger played in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of Daddy"?
Did the subject also come to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book refers to his brother Joseph's life, so Dadst Benedikt XVI, told from his perspective, where the judges played only a nearroll.
However, I don't want to avoid that he has led a strong government in there.
However, this must be said once: Without this perfectionism, without the requirement of unconditional disabilities, it would have no longer been possible to form a institution of worldwide culture bodies of Europe and its musical tradition, which were two times in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) to Turnee.
With cheekses and bonbons alone, there are no large songs now, and every success, even in which area, but always disabilities, suffering and self-sufficiency.
As for a man, do you have Georg Ratzinger in the talks to his book?
Michael Hesemann: By the work in the book and outside, I really learned Georg Ratzinger very well and always as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep faithless and honest people, from which you can't imagine that he can't do something.
I regularly get with how many former court patterns still today, 23 years after his emerging, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of his family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict to them are clearly in minority.
Most of the judges are thankful to him today that he has broken their life and has drawn to them the world of music.
And that he always was a good, parental teacher - a strong father, of course it could be - but he was also a loving person whose respect they are looking at today and to praise them right now.
And please, again clearly: All that you are doing to him is training methods that were at that time in the agenda.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time a long time.
But it's the most unrighteous, a man, just because he's prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a median sinbock.
There's the evil purpose that is behind, only too obvious.
Because the report that has been published just discharged it.
Now the ability would be to make a 93-year-old man who has performed great services and without the outside of the Bayers and maybe even Germany would not finally know the Regensburger courts.
