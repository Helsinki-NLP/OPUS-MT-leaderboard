The head of the brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the instance
March, a federal judge accepted the accusations imposed against the former Chairman of the Brazilian Chairperson for the assumption of its involvement in a massive corruption scheme on Petrovas State Oil Company.
The Office of the Federal Prosecutor stated that Jose Dirceu will be sent in Judice for the accusations of corruption, injury and spending money in this month.
Other twelve will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of the Municipal Party, found in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, the former president of the Services for Employment of Petrovas.
Diceu is the oldest member of the Municipality Party in the care of the provisions of this scheme.
Dirceu served as the cabinet head of the former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August, where he was already arrested at home, with a 11-year penalty for involvement in a buying scheme in the Congress for more than 10 years ago.
The prosecutors declared that Dirceu decreased the shipment scheme from Petrovas, accepted myth while it was in force and continued to receive payments from the entrepreneurs after it was held at the end of 2013 for the scandal of bought votes.
According to the prosecutors, the Petrovas scheme involved approximately 2 billion dollars in the form of myth and other illegal funds.
A part of those money would have returned to the campaign fund of the party found at the holding and their aliats.
It would also include myth to the directors of Petrovas in exchange of umbrellad contracts.
Recupering of a survivor student from Peshawar's mask
A paralyzed teenager after shooting four times in the most purchased terrorist attack in Pakistan has succeeded with a "miraculous" recovery after a treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, the doctors of Pakistan said that he would never be able to go anymore.
At least 140 years, most children were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the army in Peshawar in December of the past year.
Mohamed, who came to London last month for the operation, will be extracted later from the hospital.
Exactly in nine months ago, on the morning of Tuesday, Mohamed stood at the first time of the assistant and cared for his teacher.
Even then, seven armed guys in the uniforms of the care agencies entered the public school of the army.
They took cents of explosives and had to fulfil a simple mission: to kill all men, women, and children who went out.
"I can't forget what happened that day," Mohamed said in a white look.
I was in the amphiteater, I asked questions... then I heard weapon fires outside.
The terrorists entered and started killing, and our professor was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he brought four students out of the amphiteater while the carnage was developed.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, crying.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I've kept him.
Then I was shot behind, and he was in the head.
The most of the murderers in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed recalls that immediately after that he left and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the bread down.
The doctors of Peshawar from North Pakistan, then the Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go anymore.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul come out," she says, "Mohamed's father, Sher Khan.
The nine months were the worst of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son would never be able to use his crichet anymore.
They made a campaign and asked assistance from Pakistanian television, attracting the campaign of famous people like Imran Khan, crichet player became political.
On the end, they were able to gather funds to bring Mohamed to the United Kingdom and offer treatment to the private Harley Street Clinic in London.
The neurochirurgyrurg Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "inspired" when he arrived in the hospital.
"He has passed the last few months in bed without moving on the other side, says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure behind him.
He wasn't in a pretty good form.
A vertebral from Mohamed's vertebrale column found
Mohamed was shot in the shadow, in the shot and behind during the attack, and the inferieur vertebrale column was used, leading to paralyzation.
However, during a operation that spent six hours, Malik and his team were able to restore nervous terminations and rebuild the part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised of what was going on.
Exactly a week after operation, Mohamed got up and began to take steps and go.
We didn't wait for such a good result.
It was a miracle," she says.
At least two weeks after the operation, Mohamed is ready to pass the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed split the sun and began to go again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it is determined to return to Pakistan, to fight against terrorism.
"I feel that I have another chance to live," he says, drawing pictures with weapons drawn by him in school manuals and stylouri
Fisic, Mohamed becomes still stronger every day, but the psychological trauma through which he goes and now is unimaginable.
"My fault hasn't been low," he witnesses.
In my school, small kids were killed.
What crime did they do?
His mother spends a lake, eats him in the wheat, and says, "I see my son going again."
He's gonna be able to keep his lives.

Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson was recently designed as the big winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has been called many times as the most musical worker in the world of progressive rock.
The musician talent won three premises at Progressive Music Awards, which had placed this month in London, including the premium for the best album of the year for Hand.
In his review of five stars, The Guardian called the album “a smart, expressive, and artificial work”.
Still since 1980, Wilson is the more musical project engine, most of them being the rock Porcupine Tree rock.
Now, before two house spectacles in Royal Albert Hall, Wilson lanses a double LP just in vinil format, Transience, to show the "more possible" side of his activity alone.
He told BBC about his love for vinilers and his loaded program and explained how the commodity actor Matt Berry was coming to destroy the spectacles.
What does it mean for you?
I grew up even in the end of the age of vinyls and I remember that then I just waited for the CD appearance, because the vinyl was so exciting.
You bought a disc, you went with him home, had a shot, and you had to bring him back.
I love the CDs, and for some kinds of music, such as classic, are better than viniles.
But the problem with the CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing to really appreciate.
To have a vine is like you had a beautiful table in the summer.
It's something you can keep in m, while you're gonna be absorbed by verses and completed by the artistic act.
I thought it's just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have how to be if some young boys to remember their vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any fault that you're especially?
I recognize that I've saved all the faults in the '90s.
All the faults we have been bought again.
I started from the idea of repeat the collection I had at 15 years, but I passed the limit.
The first disc that I convinced my parents to buy me was Out of the Blue of the Elect’s Light Orchestra.
If I had still had the initial example, it would have had a sensitive value, but, desirablely, it's somewhere through a charity storage.
Steven Wilson hopes that the album will be a port to possible new fans.
Why did you start your new Transience compilation on the vinyl?
This was designed initially as ideas for the Day of Discover Storages, but I've lost the opportunity.
My debates house suggested to gather some of my shorter and more improper melodies.
I've been easily made the idea of doing something "input into Steven Wilson's music" and I felt unexpected that the project would be launched only on vinil.
Who purchases the vinyl also receives a warrant downloaded to high resolution.
Are you worried that the album will not show your music really?
No, because, even though I'm on the longer musical parts, there's something I've always appreciated more than anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that is more attached to the technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock of all times, has passed the time test because they have always placed the accent on the melodic and atmosphere.
What are you preparing for Albert Hall spectacles?
They don't want you to discover too much.
The repository will be completed every night.
First, it's going to be a version of the spectacle Hand.
The second night will be an incursion in my story, being more oriented to the fans who followed me for years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to break your spectacle on the second night?
And I and the others in the tour team are great fans of [the comic serial of Channel 4] Toast of London, at the point where we give all the time from it.
I thought to be Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
We talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely crazy to get him off.
You recall some albums like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does this affect your own music?
Don't inspire me in conscious manner of this, but, inevitable, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they keep you in mind.
My last album alone, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was, of course, the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I was King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all the year ago.
The current album, Hand. Erase., it's much more discharged, because we worked at Tears for Fears and XTC.
Many times you are described as the most busy rock music.
That's how you feel?
You can remove the progressive word.
I think I'm probably one of the most real people in the world of music today, and I don't say this with proudness, because, please, it's a curse.
I think I've inherited this from my father, who has an ethnic incredibly powerful work.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why the work at the puzzle was a gift, because it means I don't have to do my music all the time.
Music industry is a hard place to make you a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend that anybody as a prophecy.
I'm sick, and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I'm doing, it's a privilege, but if I had been leaning, I don't think I'd be survived.
Transience will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will song at Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his European tour 2015-2016.
A new ready contract of work at Skytrans
The new Skytrans re-inserted a part of the air company's staff who lost his job when old Skytrans entered in the wallet.
Skytrans, renewed from North Queensland, has granted a contract of 25 million dollars to transport the QGC natural gas business, which means that 18 members of the team have recovered their job.
Skytrans, a family holder of Wild, became very active in January, after Newman replaced the subvented paths that formed a large part of the air company.
The failure made more communities coherence with a isolated potential, and Warren Entsch, national-liberal national parliamentary for Queensland, was the representative vote of national liberal critics.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, restored Skytrans mark in March.
Michael Thinee, Skytrans's executive director, believed that the aircraft with QCG has already created jobs.
"We have been able to reangly 18 members of the Skytrans staff with a whole standard, as pilots and members of the team," he said.
We are also happy to have a new staff with direct logistic experience in the management of flight operations for QGC clients.
In only five months, we grew up with 100% for work, 78 members of the staff are employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract follows that Skytrans expands his flight operations from his central station in Cairns, which deserves Capul York and the Torres Strand, and includes a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 flights per week for the QGC staff and for the entrepreneurs in Brisbane to the sites in Chinchilla and Taroom, in its airports Dash-8 from 36 places, starting from Monday, 26 October.
Tony Nunan, QGC executive director, said that Skytrans received the contract following a license procedure.
"We are happy that this contract will contribute to the extension of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains his high and consequent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliament and Madam Kelly O'Dwyer receives the advice to make a greater reserve of milk to prevent votes in the room
It seems to be part of the cabinet of more women.
The new of Malcolm Turnbull will be learned on Monday and there are powerful signs that more women will occupy portfolies.
One of the views in the presence of the chair, Kelly O'Dwyer, has received the advice to make her greater milk reserve for her newborn to avoid interviewing in Parliament's charges.
The advice comes from the discipline of Scott Buchholz, who further consulted his labourist omolog to find out what is the most sustainable approach for a parliamentary who is advocating, in accordance with the orders in force.
Liberal parliament Kelly O'Dwyer and her daughter, Olivia.
Pursuant to the current orders - the set of rules which support the behavior of parliamentaries in the Camera - the mexicans that advocate a vote repeat in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Camera.
But Whip didn't know about this exoneration before he was consulting the discipline of the position, Chris Hayes, in this problem.
The facts were predicted in two occasions when O'Dwyer could not participate in a division meeting and could not comply with his obligation to hold a talk because you just started the adjunction.
One of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliamentary thought to make her a higher milk reserve rather than to lapse.
Scott Buchholz, parliamentary of Queensland, is the discipline of the chair.
Moreover, both have resolved their discussion.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources from Buchholz and O'Dwyer declared for Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins Division was furious when it was told him to make a greater reserve of milk instead of bearing his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This fact is discovered even when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works on his new cabinet.
Buchholz, liberal national parliamentary of Queensland, was promoted in accordance with the discipline by the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the trial of censuring motion from February of this year.
O'Dwyer, in the picture of Amanda Rishisceth from the Laburist Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three members of Parliament.
The disciplined chairman, Phillip Ruddock, was divided to only a few days after Abbott complied with a censuring motion by which he wanted to remove his function, replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, Liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and called with adjudic discipline.
Nickolic held in the last time the first page of the journals, after it was discovered that she sent to Turnbull a message in which she wanted to refuse to contest Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter, Olivia, was born in May.
It is one of the three parliamentaries who have become members this year.
The wording of the labour party, Catherine King, stated on Wednesday that the voting for the mothers who were stumbled was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven years]," she wrote to Twitter.
The responsible for discipline should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and could be promoted under Turnbull, who declared mid-day that he wanted more women in his cabinet.
"Nobody wants more than me to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in ministers, in all else," said the Prime Minister for the reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included one woman in his first cabinet and, after pressures supported to promote the representation of the female in Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the delay of December.
Five things he wants the environment of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will markets respond?
Mal Maiden, editorial at BusinessDay, examines the impact that Malcolm Turnbull could have in the sector of the business.
March, the lobby groups in the sector did not know how to demonstrate his enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took the country's frauds as a Prime Minister.
The main reason is that a great part of what many of them would want to see was abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or simply reached a negotiated suspension due to the "crash-or-crash-through" political style of Abbott.
References of interest groups have spoken at union on their hope in the ability of Turnbull to satisfy public interest, reach a political agreement and do good things.
So what exactly expects the largest companies of the country and their representatives of our new Prime Minister?
CHAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to remove negative publicity.
Turnbull himself established as an initial objective of the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech in which a year in the middle of that cause, the Free Commerce Agreement between China and (ChAFTA) represented the central point of his attack by the labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech of August, Turnbull criticized the "revolutive challenges of economic schovinism" of the Labour party on that problem and expressed its concern for the racial trial of critics.
"In the context of ChAFTA, winners are, numeric, much more than losers," he said in the same speech.
The medium hopes that he wins this debate.
Don Argus, representative of the environment, highlighted that this is a key point, supported, among others, by the A.I.A.A.A.A.A. (which represents the greatest 100 companies of the ́s company) and by James Packer, the billion of the industry.
The Medium wishes to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to deal with the negative publicity and to negotiate with the whole seat.
The Minister for Small Undertaking, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of Analiza Harper.
This could lead from the beginning to certain differences with the environment.
The evaluation of effects shall apply to large and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer due to the lack of competition.
It is called "evaluation of the effects" because it takes not only the actions and purposes of the company but also the effect they will have on competition and market.
The way this assessment is edited is extremely important for results.
Analysis of the competition law recommends a change in the evaluation of the effects, which will make greater corporations to deal with smaller operators on the market.
The Government carried out by Tony Abbott was by the A.A.A.A.A.A.
Turnbull now understands that he wants the whole cabinet to think about what he's going to do.
The CAA was like burning to show that if Turnbull follows the recommendations of Harper analysis, consumers will need to pay greater prices.
It is ironic that all the environment is the one who advised the new Prime Minister to have a greater respect for the cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do so that it leaves Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Undertaking (that is from Harper's recommendations) to support its arguments before his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could contribute to the prevention of blood cancer
Spanish researchers followed women of age between 60 and 80.
Those who eat primarily plants, feed and milk oil have reduced their "significant" probability of apparition of cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the table of multiplying under the sign of the question
Terrence Howard is thinking I've completely understood the wrong arithmetic.
The negative person in Empire stated for the Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think that one is equal to one.
"How to be equal to one?" he said.
If once I do one, it means that two don't have a value, because once he doesn't have any effect.
One times do two, because the fourth root is two - so what is the fourth root of his two?
It should be one, but we're saying it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't understand what you mean.
Instead of surprising, Howard's teachers didn't agree with his theory, so that it refused to the Pratt Institute, where the chemical engineering study.
"Behold, you can't keep your eyes when you know something is wrong," he explained.
Howard found the name of the "Terryology".
The actor testifies that it takes time to break and resume foreffects, surfaces, magnetes and plastic fees to illustrate its theory “one time” and other similar theories of his own.
He stated for a review that he and his former wife, Mira Pak, passed at 17 hours a day by creating these illustrations.
The Rolling Stone editor described Howard's creatures as “infined incomplete, bidimensional and tridimensional forms, connected between them with cooking or captured with magnetics”.
Howard says, among others, that he hopes to receive the American Patent 20150079872 A1 (‘Systems and methods for construction carriers’).
In addition, the actor of the “From a idol” says that Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would“search it ” if she had seen the Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've been wondering since I was three-four years old why a bowl took a round shape?"
Why don't it become a triangle or a quarter?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hoped to change all the course of teaching.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that once I do one," he said.
They will not need to grow in ignorance anymore.
For twenty years ago, they'll know that one one is doing two.
We're on the way to discover a new truth.
True universal mathematical.
We'll check for a few 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
March, during the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera perfectly.
The 22-year-old pop star sang a little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, interpreting "Mary Had of Little Lamb" as Spears, then showing its voice qualities with the melodia "The Wheels on the Bus" played with Aguilera's voice.
On his side, Fallon did good work by imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
Both also interpreted versions of the "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weeknd.
This week, the name of the Great appeared in pressure.
On the same day, it was to the "Good Morning America", where he dismissed the incident of the gogoashe lin.
Taco Bell hopes that the "Cantina" restaurants in which you'll use wine to become points of city interest
Do you want to have a elegant night in the town?
Taco Bell is a choice.
On September 22, the Mexico Restaurant Restaurants will discover a new location in the Wicker Park area in Chicago, offering a menu of aperitive tapes, a fresh picked by a local artist and even alcoholic baths.
It is the first test location of the "Taco Bell Cantina" restaurants of the lance, which is addressed to the teenagers, concentrated in the centres of the cities.
Taco Bell, who has nearly 6000 restaurants in the United States, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with efficient food, quickly prepared, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With a pay note Taco Bell average of 7 USD, the company used driver-through services and quick services to attach the number of clients necessary to benefit.
However, Taco Bell suggests that, to address the new generation that “searchs the most central urban environments in which they live, work and work,” testing places must follow a model, with smaller spaces and slighter options.
To make a driver-through, you need a terrain.
Can you imagine what it means to buy a earthquake in a area like Wicker Park?
"Don't allow you," said for the US TODAY Neil Borkan, the Taco Bell French that will operate the location in Chicago.
At Chicago location, the new menu will be prepared at the traditional Taco Bell offers, in a divorced kitchen, where "You can see food at your own" before it is prepared, declared for Press Meredith Sandland, boss for december at Taco Bell.
In the new place, it will also serve wine, drinking and alcoholic baths, following the recent example of many of the Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventeen and five of Starbucks cafes offer menus of "noon" that include beer, wine and wine.
One thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic baths.
Company said that another location of Taco Bell Cantina will be discontinued in San Francisco sea AT&T Park in this month, replaced the driver-through service and parking with an internal court and a window for sales.
These changes of location, atmosphere and attachments indicate the fact that the ship of fast food restaurants wants to attraction the other type of clients outside those seeking fast food last night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when he introduced Cantina menus and closer burrits to competite with Chipotle, the project was supported by a public campaign attached to the content of the new preparations protein.
If they succeed, the Cantina restaurants will represent another step to a higher level.
Taco Bell said, in 2022, he intended to remove 2000 restaurants in the United States.
As Sandland said for the AP, "may hundreds" of them will be like "Cantina".

The Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John on Monday night only a few days after the British artist declared publicly that he wanted to speak to the Russian politician to discuss the company about the antigay legislation in Russia.
The British, homosexual declared, tried without succeed to get a interview with Putin while it was in Russia in November 2014, one year after the protests of this land and continued two concerts in 2013, in the period of the history of this state, after adopting conflicted laws, which prohibited the "propaganda homosexual" in the loss of minors.

Cocos "sing" all in the ANNRP directory
The Dorin Cocos's man tried to save from a murdered sentence, "canding" all against Jewish people and detailing how the billions of the former members of the UNRP Commission were provided.
Ireland at the High Court of Casatie and Justice in the directory where the son's allocation is juiced or Alin Cocos, of the former Officer of DIICOT Alina Bica and of the former members of the Central Commission for the Stabilation of Dispaguements in the ANSRP, Dorin Cocos has been shot by the park of sincerity.
He repeated all the accusations and told the Judicians in security how he helped Gheorghe Stelian in the case of the ANNRP disapprovals, instead of demanding to be juiced faster and counted on his cooperation.
Thus, Cocos seemed to know Gheorghe Stelian even since 2006 and that he was imprisoned with this after more immobilization.
He claimed that Sergiu Diacomatu met in 2010, and he told him that he worked at the ANSP.
Moreover, I found that (Diacomatu, n.e.) is President, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at the ANSP, we asked him to help us.
I promised money, 2,5 million euros, the money I told him I would give them more transes.
I promised them a political exhibition, to work out.
"Diaconomatu told me to help me, but he needs sustenance," Dorin Cocos showed in the judecate room.
He also said that, in its knowledge, he entered in relation to Crinuta Dumitrean, who then was the Chief of the Central Commission of Despagubiri, which promised her 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew that he wanted to get over $300,000.
Diacomatu had already a political trial, and I gave them five million euros.
Dumitrean Crinute a million euros, Dragos Bogdan gave him 800,000 euros.
I exactly gave all these money to him in the past, so to make sure the folder will be solved.
"That I said to them: to solve the folder, to buy the packaging," he told Cocos.
A question of why it came to do these things, Dorin Cocos stated that he received eight million euros for the positive solution of the second file of Gheorghe Stelian.
I received, for the second folder, eight million euros to solve the problem, but only 1,2 million euros.
In 2013, I got Alina Bica.
"I've never spoken with this about money or lands," he showed Cocos.
He ever seemed "is a notority that all the members were understood before sitting."
I didn't have emotions that they wouldn't vote positively.
All functions were political in the ANSP, but I personally didn't help Diacomatu politics.
"I told him that he helps political help just to quiet him," he completed his Cocos statement.
Point to the European Court of Justice to the DNA
The first Victor Ponta was at DNA yesterday, for just five minutes, while he sent new documents to the "Turceni - Rovinari" folder.
Victor Ponta fled to DNA with a document of the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the margin of the folder in which it is searched for in writings under private signature, complexity in fiscal evasion and splitting money, Victor Ponta went from its own initiative to DNA, even the documents that they could be sent by a lawyer.
It wasn't so, the prosecutor had no time, the first walking after five minutes, while he left more documents in the register.
I wanted to follow the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what is happening to the services contracts.
I'm saying that we've been working, the prosecutor says we didn't do, the European Court of Justice told us to see each other's job, because, as long as the taxes were paid, it's okay.
"In the view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all European Union tariffs, we have no case here," said Prime Victor Ponta at the outcome of DNA.
The point was more likely to apply the decision of the European Court if we are members of the EU.
Since then, the first expected the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call it again to hear, but to give him a answer to his requests, including the disconnection of the document.
John isi ownreaza the mandate without television
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to look at TV.
And you don't even have such an apparatus, since you pay your TV tax once with energy.
However, if you're the head of the state, things change radical.
Because, practically, it is underlined that, in the case of the President of Romania, it is also recorded to the daily realities.
President Johannis is confunded in a total silence in the office or in Cotroceni
Only that, at the end of the even closest people from the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Johnnis refused to have television in the presidential office.
And after not looking at the television - no program, nor even on the RTL or Pro Sieben posts - the presidents did not hold the radio posts nor read the newspapers.
Moreover, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the pre-cessor or a priority request.
On the contrary, Johnnis was just going to receive the report of the sights that put him into the positive.
And on this Language, the only brain is facebook's processing, is more seriously the blocking to which, through its passion, the head of the State impeaches the activities of the Presidency.
And this because, soon as he had passed so bitterly from his installation, Johnnis has not yet signed the loyality statements of more than half of the employment of the President.
What becomes a more serious problem, both human and legal.
Lines and peace
Those in the presidential enthusiasm are already clear that no one can strike "feng shui" from the state head office.
Where it's quiet and peace.
What's right, just after a new hour without a minute (no more, no less!), tomorrow, when the former Sibi edge requests the officers.
A habit that probably hasn't disappointed from the time he was leading the city's primary of Cibin.
And about the fact that Johnnis doesn't want TVs in the office have already been born unnumbered legends, being people from the Cotroceni Palace who have reached the variance that the presidents would try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially there's no radio device.
Only in this rytme, it should be meditating how cutting in darkness, so that iluminated devices can hide audio-video recording technology.
Just good.
Moreover, another strangeness from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of the State only of the "pzoitive monitoring" of the president's activity.
I mean, if there appears a good knowledge of Klaus Johannis or his wife, the head of the State will receive the continuous biorroom.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that it was prohibited to "negative monitoring" in the conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was re— not just as the following nights from the television in which he was criticized, but the request every morning, with priority, was negative stress.
That doesn't mean that he helped him to do something, but that's what the guy's talking about!
And at least he could never have excuses that he was not well informed of alternative sources.
Not outside or confirmed
Now, before we're laughing and mystery why he doesn't want to look at Klaus Johannis at the TV.
However, it would be more important to resolve, independently under what formula, the contractuality of the hundreds of employees from the Presidentship.
What, in order to be able to work here, is required to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the State found in function and which must be ported and signed.
Only since December and before now, Klaus Johannis had not signed for confirmation even half of these statements, it had to happen in at least 30 days.
As hundreds of employees, representing over half of the staff of the Cotroceni Palace, have an incertain employment now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of the State doesn't sign their personal declaration, they should be given outside.
Only that all of them haven't received any negative!
So, in the meaning of it, I can come by any inspectors of the Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half year, hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere at the border of the law.
This is before the president decides if he gets out of it or confirms it on posts, the decision to be strictly strict.
The authorities declared that a teenager had put an attack on Pape Francisc during the visit in the United States
The inspired ISIS plan of a teenager to attack Papa Francisc during his visit in the United States was “despirative” than operative, confirmed a police source for Fox News on March.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in Philadelphia in August, when the law application authorities delayed the plan.
The plan is the same as the Texas Represident, Mike McCaul, President of the Internal Security, stated a source for Fox News during a present interview on Sunday.
"We monitor the threats against Pape for this visit in the United States," McCaul at the ABC "This Week".
Dad Francisc was not mentioned as a specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
on the common information of the FBI and the Department for Internal Security of 14 August, where the teenager was planning to use more attackers, fire weapons and explosives, as “a foreign demnitar during a high-level event”.
In the bulletin, the minor has been radicalized through social networks.
It is possible that the teenager suffers from a mental disease, declares a source of the law of Fox News, but without giving precise details about the disease of the people.
Moreover, on Sunday, McCaul repeated the potential for an attack from such a "single" bullet at the level of the entire nation and mentioned that it was informed by the Secret Services about a "strict secret place" for the Pope's visit.
And with this, there's a big security risk, so as soon as it comes, I think we'll be with all very watchful and we'll protect it when he's coming to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
The shelter from the average period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, says experts
Irish archaeologists discovered olu details about the strange schelet from the average period, found at the root of a 215 years old tree.
The fashion of Collooney, Sligo, fell during a furtune that passed this year, dragging out the macabra look of a schelet captured between his reds.
The Irish Service of National Monuments brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archeological Services to exhaust and analysis the remains, discovering such a relief.
"He was murdered violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Archeology Services Sligo-Leitrim, for FoxNews.com.
On the top side of the piece, he has hurts caused by cut. There's another way in his hand, which suggests that he's trying to open it.
The scene is of a t’arr between 17 and 20 years old.
The radiocarbon analysis shows that the rests are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We can't know if he was murdered in a luxury or in a personal discourse," Dowd says, noting that he was buried after a Christian ritual, with his head directed to the west.
"Probabel was buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd said for FoxNews.com that who planted the bathroom didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual," she said.
There are historical documents that confirm that there is a church and a cimitary in the area, but today there are no visible followers of them.
There is another unusual aspect of discovery: the height of the tear.
"He had 1 meter 77," says Dowd.
For the medium-term society, that means pretty much.
The Federal Government costs $1,5 million to study what children think about food
National Health Institutes (NIH) have sold nearly 1,5 million dollars by studying what small children think about food.
The project, called “The module in which children and little food children perceive” is deducted by the University of Chicago and, for now, stated that the small ones are not predicted to eat linched foods of others or that they have spent elsewhere.
According to the project's finance, "the appropriate nutrition is important for health and long-term, but many Americans have no healthy diets in the field of nutrition."
There are evidences that suggest that the first food models of children and children have long-term consequences for the health of the whole life.
Pressing for this study is that I miss research on how children look at food.
“In despite the complexity and significance of food selection, the psychology for child’s deceiving dedicated little attention to study how children and small children perceive, teach and understand food, said the finance.
The current proposal applies cognitive development methods to test the social influences of the choice and consumption of food for children and small children.
Researchers say about kids that they have “limited knowledge in the food area”.
Children with age between three and six years "I know more about food than children and children," but they are " extremely moftrose consumers".
A action played in the "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of an indispensable exposure in Tennessee
A action playing in the "Star Trek: Voyager" TV series was arrested in the east of Tennessee State, accused of being exposed to children.
More media channels report that agencies Jennifer Ann Lien, age 41, who played Kes' role in the TV series, is accused of two unexpected exposure crimes, in which children were involved under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.

Super boss: Six women jul between maternity and service
On the contrary to any other world else, with Papua New Guinea, in the United States there is no centralised policy on payable maternity consent.
Two weeks ago, when the executive director of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was injured with female, but she was going to take a very short maternity grant and “loud in” his free time, the woman in 40 years of age was criticized for the encouragement of a superfemian culture or nothing.
But Mayer, itself is a symbol of the top woman, to be guilty of the unrealistic challenges?
How are other women leaders?
Seema Patel, adjunct advocate and director of the Office for the application of the job standards in San Francisco, has been able to get a job in Washington DC a few years ago when her boss has hit her with an unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," she said her boss.
But if you're going to make your family in the future, you're going to get your consent now.
Patel's employee was the federal, and she didn't even receive a day of payment of maternity as part of her work contract.
At that time, Patel was married and very concentrated on the career, and the family was the last thing he thought about.
But she made her boss' advice.
She avoided using her medical concession days for four years, so when she remained pregnant with her first child, two years ago, she gathered three months of payment.
Six months ago, when she born the second child, Patel couldn't apply the same strategy anymore.
The four months of grant that he took was totally unpaid.
Patel says she didn't feel any refus from her colleagues, but she has a problem with the work.
"I look very disappointing for anyone who is trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your own is not worth the fact that you're going to be an older.
Karen Choi, President of the Capital Group Assets Management firm, says that any employed woman who is and Mother must be praised.
Choi, who has four children, of whom one is a six-month baby, describes the yellow between mother quality and work as a "constant lump".
The secret that you don't excuse is to have "increasing family with you" and a bone and a babysitter, accepting that there are things you will not be the best ("not everyone can be Martha at internal threats") and simply go through it.
Choi says he took a more mother's grant for each child, starting from two months and half for the first and ending six months for the last.
This makes it a choice, especially in her activity.
When your kid's sick, he's got a fever, a whisper, and you're staying driving all night to care about him and you know that the next morning you need to take your other school kids, then go to the service...
Then it becomes very complicated," she says.
However, her company supported her and mentioned that the performance of her investment portfolio had nothing to suffer.
When she entered the financial industry, after university, about 20 of her choice colleagues, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have been rejected.
Women who refuse to work, then start again, have no more the same chances to the top places, she says.
It is difficulty to say, “In short term it is a sacrifice, but long-term results are seen.”
Anyway, her children helped her give a sense of this sacrifice, because all four children are girls.
One of the things that help me go far away is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates her scientific researcher and professor Kelly Posner, 48 years old.
Children know that their mother helps to save human life.
Posner, founder and director of the Centre for the Evaluation of the Single risk from the University of Colombia, says that it is important for women to know that they can have a "objective size" in relation to the career and fulfill it.
It's very important that women believe that I can have a vision.
Most of them don't allow her to believe that," she says.
Once he held a presentation before the 200th, including the officers of the ́s, in Italy during a webinar, when he was pregnant in eight months.
She also helped, tell her, because she could stop the car and answer the phone after she took her children or answered a e-mail.
The jongle between maternity and a requested career has been helped by optimistic personality, inclinated to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to the good end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that to do mother and career to work together only through private assistant networks, such as bones, is wrong.
"You shouldn't have happiness or win lottery to succeed," she says, described the fashion of the system of support of women and women - mentioning very small salaries, the deficit health system and the deficiency of a payable maternity grant.
"As society, we don't care for others," she says.
We can't even guarantee the return of the mothers who were born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following the courses of the right-faculty, was born his child when he was born.
With a husband and a child based on a medical assistant offered by a board, the leader in the field of work could take his motherliness for only two weeks and then return to the service.
Lisa Mosko, a modesty and mother of two children, says that less women will leave their profession if they will benefit more social challenges, in the form of daily care services from companies, maintaining joint agreement-building programmes and accepting the fact that effective work does not mean to stay over the program.
In the front of logistic constraints, says Mosko, the additional pressure is to activate in a area where to be a mother is sometimes synonym with the epitome of the lack of pleasure (the "mame" represents one of the most serious insults).
“The image is a part of our work, and it brings you up or takes you down, ” she explains.
"Permanent birth" of Moscow because its multiple roles to function harmonised means to keep its look and a beautiful geant in m, which, however, sometimes falls a two-play.
If he remembers that husbands are fathers, the society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers in the way they're playing women who are mothers.
Shela Olatoye, the President and the Executive Director of the New York housing Authority, who cares about the residences of over 400 000 non-orchesters and has more than 11 000 employees, says that maternity and career does not mean talking about "equilibr".
Equilibrium's notice is a little inappropriate.
It looks like a balance," she says.
Mother of three kids, one has only three months, she just took her mother's grant for seven weeks after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks wouldn't be enough, but her husband was able to take her fathership, and she could have a flexible program, which means to go before or late, so she could be with her child.
Olatoye, who walks with her friends every morning that ends at 06:00 (“the more eftin than therapy ”) still swallows.
At the service, he tried to create a “friendly environment for parents” in which it is allowed to be late for a child, and the response to e-mails should not be sent unexpectedly from the office.
"The concept and the nature of the family have changed and changed very much," Olatoye says.
"The family is very different from what was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one who needs to adapt.
The Russian humorists say they've blamed Elton John about a phone from Putin.
For chickens it seemed too beautiful to be true: a phone from Vladimir Putin, Russian President, to Sir Elton John, a song and a military for sexual minorities rights, to discuss homosexual rights.
Unfortunately, for John, it was not true: despite an exhausting post on Instagram in which the most of the Russian leader who confronted him with the problem, immediately became clear that, whoever had been called Monday night, was not Putin.
The cremlin already said he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And in midnight, two famous Russian humorists repeated that they, not the president, were the foreign voices from the end of the conversation.
"We thought it was a little probably that Putin wanted to meet him or call him, or at least not too soon," Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his college, Alex "Lexus" Stolianov, was given as the President's words, Dmitri Peskov.
"And, it seems like Elton John just waited for this phone, so he immediately believed that it was actually a conversation with the right people we gave," he stated for the Comsomolskaya Truda journal.
He said, "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation were the most beautiful and beautiful in my life.
As to finish John's standing, both announced that they would publish a record of the conversation at a popular Russian nightmare.
John's repeateds didn't give statements about pharmaceutical speculations.
On the basis of the story, the comments made by the song in the weekend, in which Putin criticized his "ridicule" attitude towards homosexuals while the military for the rights of LGBT to Kiev, particularly criticising a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibited the extension of "progress for non-radiological sexual relations" between minors.
"I would like to meet him [poutin], to stay talking," said John for BBC, saying that, although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it deserved a trial.
Then, on Monday evening, the song stopped the disbelieving of observers when published a message on a social network, showing that Putin answered his critics taking the phone and calling it.
He said that “awaited to meet him [president] before, to discuss LGBT equality in Russia”.
Unfortunately, for John, Putin was not the one from the end of the line, but Stolianov and Krasnov, known for the phones given in many Russian and Ukrainians.
Stolianov, who speaks well English, played Peskov' role and claimed that it would be the interpretation of both.
When he was asked about the possibility of a conversation, the true Peskov told the journalists that Putin would "previously meet Elton John and answer all the questions," but Kremlin did not receive such request from the song.
The Kremlin had reasons to doubt the post of Instagram, added, "but because it is not written in a right English."
We don't think Sir Elton John would have been written like grammatic errors.
Before the Russian second declared his public fashion, local media channels had already deceived that John was the victim of a foolish.
Some online users identifie it as a fault on Krasnov, for the phone politicians that they register and put on their YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Telephone calls to publics, then the publication of records became a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stolianov, which is considered many as the initiator of the genus, determined his talent to make the Ukrainian politicians to make it.
He was interviewed at the Ucrainian TV by imitating Anton Gerashchenko, the direct minister of the Internal Minister, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Gerashchenko so well that last year he spoke to the former Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomieski, better than six hours ago.
Krasnov becomes after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which went to massive road protests after massive fraud reports.
In the case of Arkadi Dvorkovich, the President of Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the President of the electoral committee, Vladimir Chuov, that Medvedev intended to grant it.
On the south of many Russian celebrations, among its victims, the former president URSS Mihail Gorbaciov, the chief of Kiev, and the campion at the box Vitali Klitschko and the Russian Ministry of Sports Vitali Mutko, who led him to ask for excuses for the behaviour of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called President Belarus Aleksandr Lukaşenko, being a son of the Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovici.
He was so convinced that the one from the other end, whose voice like Lukaşenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial affair that he wanted to talk to Putin caused a big reaction in Russia.
Legal Vitali Milonov in St. Petersburg, who contributed to the "propaganda" law, stated for The Guardian that John should not defeat Putin with a "super subject" and was ready to meet him with the song to explain Russian position.
The Moskovsky Comsomolets Journal has discovered a online survey for readers, where 39% of the respondents were saying Putin and John should meet, and 22% believed that such meeting would give Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die because of air pollution than HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, over 3 million people per year pre-dead due to the outer air pollution, more than a malary and HIV/AIDS together.
The primary cause, especially in Asia, represents a tree and carbons burning for the destruction of habitats and for the destruction, but the research shows that such an alarmant reason is the agricultural areas of Europe and the United States, where the main reason for those dead.
The report warns that if no measures are taken, the number of dead - already equal to six dead per minute - will duplicate in 2050.
"These projects should draw a signal of alarm for public health agencies worldwide," Professor Michael Jerrett, expert in environmental health at the University of California, which was not involved in research.
Most of the dead caused by the raining of the air are caused by small parts, which can be inhaled in the flames.
This causes infarct and brain attack, which are for three quarters of the 3.3 million annual dead, while the rest is caused by the cancer on planes and respiratory diseases.
Research has not included the effects of the internal air pollution, such as the fires for hedge, which is considered to cause more than 3,4 million dead per year.
The new study, published in the Nature journal, was the first one that showed different sources of air pollen outside and estimated the number of preliminary dead caused by them, taking into account the road traffic, the centres based on fossil fuel and other sources.
Researchers used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to evaluate the impact of the air pollution of different populations, including new information on how it affects the poverty of China and India.
A third of all pre-mortal deaths was the result of the use of fuel that produces smoke, such as the tree and carbows, for the load of residences or the halt, and of the use of the generation of distillation diesel for electricity, all of them are the dangers of re-resistance.
The consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of the 645 000 annual dead in India and a third of the 1,4 million annual dead in China.
However, research discovered that agriculture of amonics had a “remarkable impact” according to Professor Jos Lelieveld from the Chimic Max Planck Institute in Germany, who conducted research.
A five of the dead at the global level are caused by these areas, which are mainly from lives, birds and sugars and from the use of injuries.
Ammonia reacts to trading and industry evacuation gases and produce small parts, as the main reason for the dead because of the east air pollution from the United States, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," Lelieveld says.
In the entire United Kingdom, 48% of the previous deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Trade poultry is still a major factor in decade countries, which causes a five of dead, despite measures against pollen vehicles.
This only caused 5% of the dead at the global level, but the number could grow as much as more machines appear on the streets in the deceasing countries.
The air pull from the centrals, especially those working with carburants, was significant at the global level, providing one of the seven dead.
In the United States, it is the main factor, which causes a third of the 55,000 annual dead, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air powder, especially in the burning regions and with a lot of rain, has caused almost a five of the dead at the global level caused by air pollution.
This source represents a major factor in some arid countries, which is 92% of the dead in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The surrounding between the heavy degree and the large number of residents tells them the word of public health, but it does not know any more about the sources of poultry for early deaths," says Jerrett.
Rehabilitations are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at the global level.
Today, it is supposed that all parts are like toxic.
However, if those caused by burning fuel are more toxic, as some scientists deceive, the percentage of early dead that could be assigned to agricultural assets would be less.
Even so, Jerrett states: "The discovery is very valuable... because the agricultural has not been generally seen as a major source of air or pre-mortal dilution and suggests that there is much more attention to agricultural sources, both science and political activities."
Dr. Oliver Wild, specialist in the atmosphere at the Lancaster University of the United Kingdom, said: “The study even highlights the need for air quality control to avoid these dead, especially in the very population areas of Asia.”
A statement of Victor Ponta pressures and more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop with lies, the first Roman speaks of attitudes that bring memories of nazism
The relations with Hungary, already stressed after the announcement on the building of a guard at the border with Romania, after the frontier of the Sarba, have a new depreciation in accordance with the declarations made by the Prime Victor Ponta, who accused the Budapest authorities of Monday that he treated the reactivates "with battle and inserted".
Hungarian diplomaties reacted hardly talking about "extremist and lying", but Victor Ponta did not leave more and accused officials in the nearby that I was "a Russian" for Europe.
Notice that it is not for the first time Ponta trying to stress Roman-Hungary relations by declarations made at delicate or electoral times.
Everything started from a statement made on Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tried to argument that Romania cannot receive more than 1.800 repeated.
You're the problem of our logistics to treat those people like some people, not how they treat our exhibition veins, with battle and inserted.
I don't agree with that.
Mr Basescu was put in front of a hatred and horrible feeling that exists in all societys, as well as a xenofob feeling.
It's very good to do a debate, but we're going to do the job to solve the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," he said Monday Victor Ponta, quoted by the truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta mentioned when he spoke about the insertion of the repositories, but Czech was recently in the center of critics after he wrote numbers on the hands of the migrants found in more trains, in a gest who remembered the procedure used by the Nazis to identify the Jewish prisoners in the concentration lakes.
Peter Szijjarto, according to the Hungarian Science Agency of MTI, taken by magyaridok.hu, like probably internal political crises that hurt Victor Ponta's position to make "extremist and false statements".
The insarcination with the Romans from Budapest was invited to offer explainments, reports Mediafax, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements on how Hungary manages the immigrant crisis," states the Hungarian Ministry of External Affairs.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for External Comert and External Actions in Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprendance" in relation to "constant investigations of Victor Ponta to save his moral position by antiungering lies", highlighted Budapest's diplomacy.
"I don't want to answer the challenges coming from exhibitional representatives - but read the report below and you will understand the wrath I feel like humans and European citizens, the girl of mentality and attitudes that Europe just saw in the 1930-40!!", wrote Ponta on his Facebook account.
He stresses that, as other European policies, he has the "datory" to take attention and sanctify "the constant conduct of the highest officials in Hungary" which are "a Russian for Culture and Values of the European Union" through "antisemit attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all types, and now in the crisis of resources!"
"Gimpate, aggressive laws, prisoners and brutality will not solve the problem - they will only appear that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, are political decisions with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other harms from which they flee!", accused Ponta, saying that he believes in "solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the above of European values", and "that we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!"
During the series, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject was constituted by Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black boat of Europe, a dictator, Ponta asked what would happen if the exhibitor military would take up or kill some children or women, in a speech in which he made more about nazism.
In discussion, UDMR president, Kelemen Hunor, who considers that Roman authorities should not have a "sensitive negotiation" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a garden at the border.
The leader of UDMR is to understand that this solution is not directed against Romania or Romanian citizens, he arranges that the guard could even help our strength not become a intense transit path of the ability to reach Schengen, according to Agerpres.
First, I want to highlight, to say, that we don't have to isherize, we're taking all of this as a contrary to Romania and not to use to breathe any of the relations, because it's not the case.
I think any emotional treatment, the whisper is not okay.
"We must see the rational part, see why we have come here and we must know and say this, that it is not our opposite, it is not the opposite of Romania, the Roman citizens, and not impeding freedom among the two states, within the EU," said Kelemen Hunor.
The news was ignored in 2012 to Russia's offer to launch Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia has proposed for more than three years the initiation of the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace agreement, in accordance with a high official involved at that time in the negotiations with closed works between the newspapers and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
The President of Finland and the Laured Nobel Price for Peace, Martti Ahtisaari, stated that western powers have not benefited from the proposal since.
Since 2012 before now, ten thousands of people died and other millions were required to flee from the land, danding the severe crisis of repairs from the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari took discussions with the representatives of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (USA, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
It also stated that during the discussions, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, offered a plan that included between others and the addressed proposal for Assad to reject the power at a given time, after the start of peace treaties between regime and opposition.
It proposed three things:
One - we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we must start a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Tree - we have to look for a elegant way to Assad turn away," Ahtisaari said, reporting the position of the Russian ambassador.
Instead, he said that Ahtisaari, the United States, the Great Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator followed everyone, while they ignored the proposal of the Russian ambassador.
"It was a chance lost in 2012," continued the former President of Finland.
Officially, Russia continued to hold Bashar al-Assad for the four and half years of war, insisting that the initiation of this could not represent a proposal in no peace agreement.
Assad thinks Russia will never leave him.
Moscova recently started to send flight, tanks and military equipment to Syria, in an effort to stabilize the regime of Assad and to encompass the extremists of the Islamic State.

The reports show that the population of animals and sea plants have been mixed in the last 40 years
The crise scale with which animals and sea plants are documented in a study that shows that sea species around the world, including the essential for human food, are in a decline that can be a disastrophal.
Pressing without more directions to the global ocean eco-economy combines and creates a series of difficulties for almost all marine lives, states the WWF's report "Blue Live Planet".
Coral recoveries are subject to serious decline risks (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangrovels and marine grapes, which depend on many other species, have recorded a significant decline, while the whole population of fish with commercial values, such as macro and tonne, has decreased vertiginosis with three areas before the 1970s, shows the report.
Many coral recipes, often described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their biological diversity, could be threatened with the extinction in the half century if the ocean oxide continues to rise, as a result of the increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere, which causes a proportional proportional increase of the carbonic acid level in the sea.
"The healthy sea represents a extraordinary source of beautiful and natural surprise and also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," Louise Heaps, the leader of marine policies in WWF-UK, contributed to the implementation of the report.
"In the fishing in·s, which deteriorates coast habitats, and without solving the global burden problem, we like the seeds of a economic disaster," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of the scientific issue published, but also on the Indices of the living planet, a database of the Zoological Society in London, is one of the most detailed studies of marine life ever undertaken.
Approximately 20% of the total mangrove areas divorced between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) This researched a big variety of marine species, fish, sea-free broadcasts and marine castravetes - a animal like a wheat, with hair-fed skin - to sea plants such as mangrove and alge.
The report discovered that alge areas were decreased by about 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas were decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of crevet fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
During a single generation, human activity has caused great damage to the ocean, taking the fish faster than it can be reproduced and also having their circumstances.
It is needed deep changes to ensure a abundant ocean life in the following generations," said Marco Lambertini, Director-General of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines were recorded in fishing species for commercial benefits.
For example, 58 of 17 species of populations belonging to Scrombidae - macrou, ton and sardin - have reduced 74% between 1970 and 2010, without giving signs of recovery, the report says.
We're in a course of fishing that could end with the privacy of people of a vital food source and a essential economic engine.
Fisheries in ́s, the destruction of marine habitats and climate changes have serious consequences for all human populations, and the poor communities, based on the sea, will be killed as soon as possible," Lambertini said.
"The colapse of the ocean ecos could decline a serious economic decline and could undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and subnutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, Scientific Director of the ZL, said: “These alarming numbers prove how quickly people change plants and animals in the ocean and represent a clear warning about the problems with which we could face as a result.”
Sea barba: "fishing" spread submarine, which takes rich seeds in minerals and stabilises the sea background.
During the last century, the surface of the copper was decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: exists in 123 countries, almost half of the total surface, representing only five countries.
Approximately 20% of the total mangrove areas divorced between 1980 and 2005, mainly because of human invasion.
Coral recovery: some of the richest and more productive rooms on the earth.
A sfert of the whole marine species lives in coral or near them, but three quarters of them are currently amino, and many can disappear through this century if the ocean acid continues to rise.
The residences in the landscape: very few are known about the closer areas of the ocean, but the decline of the amount of fish taken in these places inaccessible in the past 40 years suggests that they are also affected by marine changes at the global level.
Steven Gerrard did not have the racism accusations that would have been brought to him by his former company from Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
A passenger from his autobiografie in the work "My Story" (My story), serialised by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the senegalez player saying "It's not really interested in the ball" and that it's the colleague who has been "the less" in the 17 years of the club.
As a reaction, Diouf would have answered Gerrard to the senegalez radio post Groupe Futurs Medias, quoted translated to the attacker, which would have said that “Gerrard never had the colors.”
Gerrard's lawyers refused any accusation of racism.
In his latest book, Gerrard, who has been published and before it appeared bad about Diouf, criticized the attitude and degree of his former colleague's professionalism.
"I don't want to lose my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I must mention his irotic sezons in Liverpool as an example of how things can go down," he wrote.
"I think Diouf is not really interested in Balbal and that he doesn't care about Liverpool," he continued.
For example, the way he cut a big and weaken flegma in a Celtic fan in a Cupa Uefa from Parkhead in March 2003 represents a evidence of his behaviour and ranchiunous behavior.
Diouf has shown a converse figure of Anfield throughout the time, his most notable night being the Celtic Park.
In front of the senegalez, the police was asked after the episode of the sculpt and amended with the counter-valuation of his salaries for two weeks in the club, a sum of 60,000 lires is given to a humanitarian organization to the election of Celtic.
In his previous autobiografie, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as a lonesh and egoist.
"His attitude was completely wrong," he wrote then Gerrard.
I felt that it wasn't ready to make the whole effort to help Liverpool get back to top.
Diouf, who now plays in the Malaysian Sabah Club, criticized him, in his row, in public on Gerrard and attacked Gerrard's old friend and partner, Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard "egoist" and claimed that no one of Anfield likes the player who led the team to the Victory of the Campions Liga in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted by saying that Gerrard is “gelous”.
He stated: “Gerrard is just zealous to me.
He didn't reach the results I had in the ball.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the boss, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the world, the biggest experts in the Bal Bal have encountered me among the first seven players in the World Campionship and between the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't feel apartment.
I'm going to other countries, I'm vened, while Gerrard's worried as long as he goes out of his birthtown Liverpool.
From herou the professional dancer: the quick way al Alek Skarlatos spre “Dancing With the Stars”
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skarlatos does not play only the role of the hero in uniform.
It's also a type t'arr, attractive and athletic, in the same measure of discreet and modern, saying producers.
"There are many categories and we always look for the most popular at the moment," Deena Katz, the executive producer of the ABC spectacle.
I swear she'll be printed after that.
It's quiet.
He's got something special.
Before being competitive to the famous spectacle, but just a few weeks ago, Scarlatos arrived in the international pressure after he took his attitude toward a great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a boy armed with a AK-47 in a train full of travelers from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could be a murder in the table by a potential terrorist.
After that, Skarlatos, a 22-year-old of the National Army, who grew close to Sacramento, received a phone from President Obama, a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a food with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and French.
Although a few local appreciations - Friday, in Sacramento, a paradise has occurred in the honor of the târr - it has not been expected to such positive reactions or to the invitation to participate in “Dancing With the Stars”.
"Nothing in a million years I wouldn't have thought I'd receive this offer," Skarlatos witnessed the Sabbath, in a pause from the dance repetitions together with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything looks like it's new and I'm going.
Even before the Monday spectacle, he repeated that he was "easy emotionated," he was a professional at his first foxtrot, obtaining points that brought him nearly in the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best representations of the series.
Katz and the executive manufacturer of the "DWTS" Rob Wade said that they wanted to keep a free place in the spectacle for competitors invited in the last hundred meters, such as Skarlatos, who grew up in the eye of the public.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends found in the vacation, who had deceived an army attack in a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to dance competition.
He looked for social networks, found the family members and sent messages to Skarlatos.
When this occurred in "Good Morning America" to report the incident during which Stone and other passengers were hurt, Katz worked with the ABC time program to avoid transiting through all media bargage.
And he supported the "Finth-Pledory", then waited unnecessaryly to find out whether Skarlatos would accept to participate in "DWTS".
"And all was very uncertain, because this is so difficult why he does," Katz witnessed.
I've been asking him if he's got a danceman.
Skarlatos, which is in a short conviction from the Nacional Garda, had not even seen a whole spectacle soon.
It's like to participate, mainly because he wanted not only to be taken into evidence.
Emission couldn't invite all three friends.
However, producers had an egg in the hand: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with hands and amputated powder.
Those encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite competitor of fans and finalists of the last season, and to ask him about his experience.
Probably that was the critical point, with Katz's unrepentant "harrying" and "instant messages", she said.
"Noah is a great guy and I wanted to know how the army will be made and how the picture of my friends will be protected," Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Skarlatos, a great lovers of sport and history, never danced for then, and Arnold witnessed in interviews that he tried to make him relax and refused to military position quite strict.
But Katz says it's confident that it's going to be adapted and that spectators will react positively.
They will receive much love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he did.
"How do you not support him?" said Katz.
But this will only take a few weeks.
To go further, I have to dance.
Skarlatos, who's a burlack and wants to be a cop, says, for now, he's been in this whole environment of us.
The program represented the hardest fight, being required often to travel to Los Angeles between the moments in which it was claimed in the media and the various premium ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train accident, he wanted to relax with the family.
"This has been a few days and a half," he said.
Totally, I've been home four days.
There is a risk in achieving a person who draws the media attention, but it is not usually in reflectors, said the executive manufacturer Wade.
And the competitor wants to make sure that the competitor is running, and it is.
“The pressure is big and we want the participants to have an experience” said Wade.
"I didn't want Alek to ever say, "Aoleu, in what did I get?"
Let's keep the pumps on them.
McRib from McDonald's return.
It's the time that those who's spent the whole year sandwich with sugar meat in the form of mini-costs to be broken.
But what's more difficult to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's French offers this season speciality.
Last year, 75% of restaurants served the McRib sandwich.
"In the promotion of McRib in 2015, there are approximately 8000 restaurants," McDonald's words, Lisa McComb, for The Times in a mail.
In the United States there are at least 14 300 restaurants of this fast-feed.
However, according to McComb, individual owners of French decide whether they will serve or not McRib.
"The participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
The owners/operators are free to offer the menu that they think they want their local clients.
And if you still ask what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients last year, with a videoclip to show reality.
According to the videoclip, the McRib sandwich is prepared for sugar meat, water, rightose and conservants.
The sandwich will be at the end of the year, at McDonald's restaurants that participate.
There is also a website with locations in which McRib is served (not affected at McDonald's), which may be useful.
People can report on the website if they find restaurants with McRib and find the next place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the closest restaurant with McRib de Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Somma County, discovered last Sunday by Aidan Briggsonian.

Keith Richards understands that new Rolling Stones records would be ready.
Keith Richards is again in reflectors with a new album only and a appearance in a documentary, but, soon, and the other members of Rolling Stones could join her in the study.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood recently met in London and made “a clear recording plans” as he said.
Thursday, Richards spoke in the ICONS series of iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A new album from Stones would be the first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But it wasn't even inactive.
In recent years, they had many tours on stadiums and sang in more small concerts in L.A., among which representations in Echoplex and the Theatre Fund.
In the last of these, they reinterpretated the classic LP in 1971, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was occupied this year, cooperating with the documentary “Keith Richards: Under the Influence” programmed to be launched on 18 September on Netflix.
This year, it started the album only "Crosseyed Heart", its third only in a five-decades carriage.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the chêsst: “Always, Richards' glass is a lower instrument than different...."
However, Richards breaks the emotion in all 15 melodies of the album, and that always means the rock 'n' role.
In the interview, Richards suggests that she will enter the most probably in the study after the South American tour from the beginning of the next year.
He didn't give other details, but, jumping after the last concerts, it's still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman on childhood, maturity and “The Family Fang”
Jason Bateman has already passed through some distress in his career, with a discreet pharmaceutical that made them look very simpler than they were actually.
Some actor of children in TVs such as "Silver Spoons" as adults re-effected in the role of an inexpressive typical in the "Krise Situation" series and in movies such as "Cosmar Chiefs".
The first movie on which he worked as a recorder was the very "Bad Words" acid in which he played.
The film was nominated at the International Film Festival from Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with the "The Family Fang", the second film that he had registered, a ambitional film in tonal view, the adjustment of the popular roman from Kevin Wilson 2011. The scenario is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the winner of the Pulitzer Price, and in the film playing Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of brothers with problems.
The film has a festival that looks for American distribution.
Many book recensions have considered her a comedy with powerful emotional tents; the film reinterprets the history, puts the accent more on its dramatic, darkest side.
A interview granted to our publication on March, Bateman says he always considered the book a more drama than a comedy.
"I never saw this book," he witnessed.
In the book, the subject and the thematics are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was a very funny subject.
So that was always the way I saw things, a drama of frivolity and comedy and excitement.
The worldwide Monday night was benefited from the introduction of the Festival Programme Director, Kerri ́ddock, which expressed its enthusiasm especially towards the Hogan Family Sitema at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, which Bateman worked. "I have not met too many fans "Hogan Family", said Bateman sec when he went on the scene.
However, the few episodes that he had registered from that Siteman brought Bateman, 46 years ago, in the 18-year-old Directors Guild.
His new movie story has a family named Fang in the center.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plu©tt), are artists with a medium reputation, known best for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their spectacles, for example, by putting on the way a jaf with the faces or playing the role of very weak travel musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to identify their own identity.
Annie is acting with some famous, even though it is renamed rather for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is romantic and journalist attempting to get famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter assured that it's just another truck of them and trying to discover the truth about their parents and make new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to note what the children's actors who want to evolute in life reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical," says Bateman.
I started the action when I was 10 years old, with parents as managers, and this film has many elements that overcome the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and active.
"It's a story that I feel connected and I understand in prostitution," he added, "and, even though I didn't try to add to her my personal experience, I knew very clearly how to show this movie to represent children with a netradiological childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she was the manufacturer of the film, who had the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write himself adjustment, Lindsay-Abaire was co-operated, who adapted his own part "Reality Trace" in which Kidman played.
Bateman testifies that he accepted the chance to regain the movie and play in it.
(Kidman, now on the scene in London in the production "Photograph 51", did not participate in the first Monday.
The bookmatch was public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's movie “a smart and caustic adjustment” that“increasingly exploited genuine disfunction and divorced the mission, sometimes from a life, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be funny and sweet, incisive and usually very dark.”
In Variety, Justin Chang called the movie "a very asper portrait" and said that Bateman "processed visible progress and a more maturity as a film recorder with this smart adaptation, but never too straight or mechanical".
After the Monday project, when Bateman and Walken traveled on the scene for the question session, the public evacuated the multi-good Walken.
About Bateman as a director and actor, Walken said during the question session that “I was impressed every day.
I wasn't coming to believe the easily with which he changed the role of the film, which is very difficulty, and the actor in the scene.
His concentration is actually anxious.
A certain scene of dialogue, Bateman stands on a screen in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the neighborhood, just a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and looks clearer.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman's actor talking to Bateman's director about the fact that he couldn't be seen.
"I seem incredible to be interested in recording movies," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, never take them to benefit me as actor.
You have the privilege to be the one with the creation of the whole experience for public, not only one instrument in that orchest, being actor, it's a complete thing.
Make sure that... the actor wants a first-plan.
During the question and answer session, Bateman witnessed that after reading the scenario, he immediately thought about Walken for Caleb's role, but also to the composer Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Known mainly for friendship with brothers Coen, Burwell composed the sound column for two other films presented at the Toronto festival: the animation film "Anomalisa" - a story of love and isolation registered by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Legendary Gangsters", interpretation of Brian Helgeland about the English gangsters in 1960, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the sound column for the Todd Haynes movie.
"I look very interesting at the tons of an alunged or obtuous tons," Bateman says, giving more explications on March.
Navigate between these tonalities and guide the armonous public and something elegant from a ton to the next, through the movie.
Carter built his carriage and an incredible reputation as an ́an who can navigate between the most complicated tons.
With the "The Family Fang", Bateman made a more drastic step, both the director and the actor, in a dominated carriage of recovery and decision, a comic and drama mixture, and darkness.
As Bateman witnessed when he finished his film introduction to the World First Monday, "Okay, badly, he went out exactly as I wanted."
The Festival is like the Oscaruris about the history of Boston Globe survey about pedofil priests
Did you win $240,000 at the lottery?
A bill at X-LOTTO value of over 240 000 dollars is unrevendicated for a month.
The non-registred bill at the X-Lotto extraction was bought by the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre from Montague Rd, Saturday, 15 August.
With the winner picture sold in SouthAva have been recorded more than 16 winner inputs in the whole, which shared their only estimated first fund of X-Lotto for 4 million dollars.
SA Lotteries® rosa; all who bought billets at X-Lotto from the English Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the extraction of X-Lotto 3555 Saturday, 15 August, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the English Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he's not to get the good news that he who wins the big premium has checked his picture at X-Lotto.
"We have tried to spread the news, because a year is our winner, and he doesn't have any more idea," she said.
Criminalist detectives perchecked the house on the Beadell Street, Burton, where the last time the divorced man Daniel Hind was seen.
Hind's sister, Chelsea Hind, said it's frustrating to stand up with information about her divorced brother, especially because the police offered two versions of this night in which it was seen last time.
Her family asked the police to percheck the residence still from her brother's disappearance.
"I hope they'd search home, I wasn't informed that they would do it," she said.
Mrs. Hind says that her family wanted to also that those who knew what she had to do with her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four children, and we have many other members of the world and half of us, we think he's alive somewhere, and the other half I think it's not.
Anyway, we want him home and put the stories out.
P' in 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 km autoway
In 2022, Bulgaria plans to build 635 km of new trails and repair 17,000 km from existing main and secondary shoes.
The finalisation of Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina, all being part of pan-European transport curriculums, is among the priorities of the design plan for the approved cycle infrastructure.
The plan aims to create a sustainable ship infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure an efficient transport management on the shoes and the effective transport management of the ships.
Bulgaria is trading for the trade of cultural goods in Syria
In accordance with the Ministry of Internal Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a trailer for the illegal trade of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East, due to its geografic broadcast.
During a talk held in the morning at a conference on the fight against the leadership of Syrian cultural inheritance, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was reacted to the new context, putting the focus on the prohibition of the transfrontal trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Presse Agency (BTA), focused on the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Internal, in particular on the Directorate-General for Organizated Crime (GDBOP) to prevent the contraband and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
It stated that Bulgaria is a rich story, which recent studies placed on the third place, after Italy and Greece, at the top of the trade of objects and cultural goods.
The Ministry of Bulgaria's Internal Ministry highlighted that the trade of cultural objectives and the destruction of historical sites in the areas such as Iraq and Syria represents a phenomenon that has increased, described as a extremely serious war crime.
He insisted on the need for concerted and decision-making measures to stop the intentional destruction of the history.
The Director-General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, stated that films of the illegal archaeological excavars in Syria demonstrate that ́ra is affected by jaf to the industrial scale.
Participants at the Middle Conference rejected that Syria's cultural inheritance is severely in danger and that the international community must be united to stop the illegal trade of cultural goods from warfare.
Rocketdyne Airport says the new AR-1 engine program could be modified
March, Rocketdyne Holdings Inc Airport stated that it was trying to finish the new AR-1 p' racket engine in 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be modified if it does not receive enough funds from the United States.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to give statements about the fact that Aerojet offered 2 billion USD to buy the United Launch Alliance (USA), a mixed company with equal actions for Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co racket launching.
Analysers say that the requested amount is a strategic movement of the Airport to complete its Blue Origin rival, a company holding by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, which develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan racket.
ULA says that the Blue Origin motor program is relatively two years before the Aerojet AR-1 engine, a contradiction that airports.
The new engine work became priority after the US legislators adopted a prohibition on the use of Russian engine RD-180 for the launch of American military or spanish satellites, after an attachment to Ukraine's Crimea region from Russia last year.
Van Kleeck suggests that Aerojet tests hardware equipment for engine, which is designed with tridimensional printed parts to match both atlas 5 of ULA, now feed by the RD-180 motor and the new Vulcan racket that develops an ULA and costs about $1 billion.
Aeroport suggests that it will be less and less risky to integrate its engine in the Atlas 5 racket than to develop a new engine and a full racket, so he thinks at the moment ULA.
Van Kleeck says that the airport planned the start of the testing of the width engines in 2017, followed by the receipt of the certificate in 2019, but the date could be reduced when the company does not receive sufficient funds from the Air Forces in contracts expected at the end of the first semester of the fiscal year 2016, which begins in October.
It is more aware that the whole company was unnecessary to see how the Air Forces will share a finance of approximately 160 million USD between rival competitors.
Also, he says that Aerojet was thinking to try other finance options for the engine, but he did not offer details.
Concurrent of the Air Forces is a public-private partnership and each of the providers must provide a third of the finance, and the Air Forces cover two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technology), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both being private companies, have self-financed the engine creation process and say it does not look for unexpected finance from the.
A beer producer company AB InBev intends a fusion of 275 billion USD with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the largest bird-producing company in the world, enhanced the SABMiller (SAB.L) company about a reception that would form a coloss that would produce a third of the total amount of beer worldwide.
Such fusion would have a market value of approximately 275 billion USD at current prices and would combine the domination of AB InBev' in Latin America with the SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with a quick december, but also with their beer manufactures in Asia.
"The true attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also a few places in Asia and Latin America," said the analyz Andrew Holland from the General Society.
AB InBev and other bovine producers are trying to enter the new markets and strengthen their weak points in North America and Europe, where consumers are still more prefering drinking produced by indigenous players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the company found at the place of two worldwide and the manufacturer of over 200 beermarks, including Perni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, stated Wednesday that it was informed of the aim of AB InBev to make a offer, which must be held lately on 14 October, in accordance with British laws.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the border.
3G, renamed for its policy to reduce the costs on the marketing socket, orchestrated the previous acquisition of Burger King, the Ketchup Heinz producer (KHC.O) and the force of Foods.
A close source of SAB mentioned that it was too early to say what he would do, because they did not receive any offer.
"Now, we are at the stage waiting and decided," he said.
Speculations regarding a fusion, which would probably deteriorate concerns about the decrease of market competition rules such as the United States and China, have spent more years.
The time of dealing, after a decade of accommodations made by AB InBev, follows a decrease of approximately 15% of the SABMiller share price starting from August.
"This is exactly the time they expected," said the Phil Gorham analysis from Morningstar.
From the financial point, for the first time in many years, it's logical.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 litres (62 USD) for SAB Miller action, may even 45 lires, according to the analysis, which would mean a total price of 130 billion USD, which would include SABMiller.
This would be the most significant M&A transaction of 2015, which has already been announced a year after the financial crisis in 2008 in view of the amount of transaction, and one of the largest acquisitions in 1980.
SAB actions were approximately 19.9% to 36.14 lires, giving them a buffer capitalization of 90 billion USD.
AB InBev action reached 6.4%.
Rivali Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) are convinced that SAB could look for another fusion as a viewing strategy, as it did in the year when it offered to buy Heineken, but it did not.
Since then, the African bathroom was combined with the Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in the last weeks a combination with Diageo or with Australian Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The global quota on the market of AB InBev, Budweiser manufacturer, Stella Artois and Corona, was in 2014 21.1%, while SABMiller was 15%, according to Plato Logic industry experts.
AB InBev intends a report between net debt and brutal profit (EBITDA) 2 times from the current 2,5 times.
It is possible to reach the objective in 2016, the realistic date on which the transaction could be completed, so it would have how to be paid to finance an acquisition.
When he bought Budweiser producer company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with 52 billion USD, the largest yellow purchase in history at that time. He allowed the report to grow over 5 times.
A big hour would allow him to accumulate a 100 billion debt.
The AB InBev familys have less than half of the company, while the two main shareholders from SABMiller are the manufacturer of cigarettes Altria (MO.N) and Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
Wednesday, Altria refused to give statements about the fact that AB InBev had been addressed, but on 9 September, the financial director, Billy Gifford, said during an analysis conference that he regularly evaluated investment in SABMiller and that “after this time we consider that the maintenance of the activity is in the interest of our actions”.
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, the leader for European investments, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, which holds action in both companies, says that AB InBev has been in a more pressure to return the numberer to the shareholders.
ABI pays a very large price, but the collection of incomes from small debts reaches somewhere to about 15%.
But we believe that the profit of this acquisition would be a deceitful percentage, 8%, after 10 years," Dwane said.
In any combination, there are significant weights relating to the violation of competition standards, especially in the United States, where companies hold about 70% of the beer market.
"The economics that could be made to distribution operations are large, and the funds related to the violation of competition rules are also greater," Erik Gordon, professor of the A Âi Ross School of the Michigan University.
Such transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 percent of the company in participation held by SABMiller in accordance with the operational agreement.
A change of control to SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get 8 per cent and call a new executive director of the company.
Molson, with the seat in Denver, would have the right to the first and last offer for the rest of 50 percent.
A Molson's wording carrier refused to comment if the company is interested in a licitation, but Molson's actions increased by more than 12 percent, to their largest value.
Any fusion could also be required to sell actions in China, where market leader is the partnership in SABMiller's participation with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao in China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that the combined group could have 28 per cent of the global market.
AB InBev is held by Lazard, and SABMiller is held by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.

Rapper Rick Ross refused the author rights request for "Everyday I'm rights"
The Newyorkez Rick Ross can't revoke his author rights for the words "Everyday I'm righttlin"," a American Jewish judge decided, refusing to cry against the LMFAO musical group, who sold tricks with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflin".
A decision published by the Federal Court of Miami on March, Kathleen Williams District Judge said that Ross' s slogan, the prominent part of his early hit in 2006, “Hustlin”, is a short term for which the courts have mentioned more times that they cannot receive author rights.
The Jewish decision of Williams lacks the process for the violation of the authors rights that Ross, whose real name is William Roberts II, has committed it against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the electropop dual in Los Angeles, along with Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copyed “Hustlin” for their own famous melodie in 2010, “Party Rock Anthem”, which contains the verse “Everyday I'm shufflin”.
Star Hip hop said that LMFAO melodia is “a manifest trial to capitalize fame and success of the melodie of Hustlin”.
He also gave Kia Motors in Jewish for the use of "Party Rock Anthem" melodie in a public campaign.
In his crying, Ross claimed that LMFAO had violated his author right, sold tricks and other products with the shufflin slogan.
In the Jewish decision of March, Williams says "Hustlin" as a melodie, is protected by the copyright law.
But the slogan of three words of Ross is exhausted from usual words and can't have author rights, it did.
The judge compared him with other famous verses of the past, such as “you got the right one, uh-huh”, “holla back” and “we get it poppin”, saying that it is“a short expression, which all courts have declared it in uniformity as impossible to place under author rights”.
The judge did not decide whether LMFAO's melodia is an unselfish copy of “Hustlin”.
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
As it is William L. Roberts, II et. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, at the American court for Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr. Carson approaches Trump in the recent presidential investigation of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential investigation for 2016, the politician No Ben Carson is approached by the Bombist Donald Trump leader in the pre-republicary elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush was low in seven points investigations.
After supporting 27% of Trump in the latest review of the CBS/New York Times, Carson, pensioned neurochirurg, reaches the second place with 23%, followed by Bush, by the TV viewer of Mike Huckabee, by the Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with about 6%.
The speech of the republican voters in the preliminary elections has grown from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, the officer of Ohio John Kasich and the former executive director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two, however, at numbers of one single digit.
Jeb Bush, the former Florida and the one who is far off the Bush family standards, decreased with seven percent points in one month, while the Wisconsin Scott Walker's officer was low with eight points.
In the last investigation, Walker's kitchen is 2%.
Carson traveled a higher exhibition than Trump in the range of college abstracts (29% at 21%), while Trump is before Carson in the preferences of voters without university diploma (30% towards 19%).
Trump is killed more men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of the investigators said that they were decided to support the candidate in their preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said I know who would vote will support Trump twice more than Carson.
It is still too early to say for 63% of the Republicans for preliminary elections.
The CBS/NYT reviews held between 9 and 13 September will be made public before a public presidential debate.
Carson's accent in this survey reflects the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of democrats at the presidential, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The last follow-up of the CBS's presidential nominations shows that Sanders followed by 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, respectively in New Hampshire, in the range of democratic voters for preliminarity.
A rename specialist in the ethics points that sexual robots should be prohibited
A rename specialist in the robotic industry has launched a campaign in which it requires the prohibition of sexual job development.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, a robotic expert from the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dismantling of women and children.
"Sexual robots seem to represent a more important subject in the robotic industry, and the models of which they are inspired - how they will show, what roles will have - are very deceived," she said to BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual workers is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology isn't ours.
It is inspired from class, race and gene.
The political power inspires the deceiving of the," she was for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about this.
These robots will contribute to the growth of sexual exploitation.
Although sexual robots now are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that those represent the first step to something left.
It's a new and emergency, but I need to stop it from the cart.
In fact, the industry seems to get out of here.
A few years ago, True Companion produced the company that started Roxxxy, "the first sexual robot in the world".
However, anxiety about the potential risks of artificial intellectuality is not something unusual, even in the range of large representatives in the industry.
Even in this present, the Executive Director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that, in five years, something really dangerous happens.
An interview granted by BBC in December of the past year, the physician and cosmolog Stephen Hawking warned that “the design of a complete artificial intellectual intellectual could mean the end of human race”.
The Great Britain occurs the first repeated in Syria - RT UK
In the following days, the British Sea will receive the first rehabitants who have fled from the way of the Syrian war, announced the Internal Minister Theresa May.
These will receive assistance in the extensive reinstalling programme.
Realings in the search for asyl are coming from the cabs found at the borders with wars defeated.
These are the first of the 20 000 resources that the United Kingdom plans to receive in 2020.
A talk in the Common Room, the Minister of Internal Affairs stated that the "fights fast" to ensure more soss.
In the process of receiving in the United Kingdom vulnerable reactions, it is impatient to be already placed at the aid point and the challenge that those need and which they deserve.
I know the honourable members and the general public want to find more details about the number and date they are estimated.
May mentioned that it needs to make more plans to ensure that reactions have appropriate provisions when they come.
I need to highlight that the extent level needs a careful and medical planning to ensure that everything works as necessary.
I and the Minister for Syrian Re-Re-Administration, Richard Harrington, we will continue to keep the present Camera in this regard.
But I'm glad to tell the Camera that we're looking forward to the first wallet of repairs in the next days and we work quickly for the planning of more society in the weeks that will follow.
Prime Minister David Cameron took his wrath to the parliamentary and military people when he discovered the plan for re-records, many believe that the number was too small.
In September, Cameron stated in the Common Room that the United Kingdom will "real up to its moral quality" and will receive 20 000 re-re-reserved from the camps of the Middle East at the following general elections.
He added that reactions will not receive complete asyl automatically, but a humanitarian status that allows them to apply for asyl after five years.
However, critics have noted that the numbers are only 12 re-repeated daily, and the former liberal democratic parliamentary Pa ́Ashdown stated that the measures are "de's".
Furthermore, Ashdown discovered that children included in this scheme should be deported when they are 18 years if they don't get asyl.
Also, seeing, and important public personalities have condemned, in their range, the measures.
A common letter, such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley, said that the response to the crisis is “too small, too late”.
"It is an entity that must be divided with our European vineyards, not simply cut down on the midsts of countries nearly by conflicts that enlarge people from their homes," they wrote.
Rubla replaces the global uncertainty fund - RT Business
Russian Rubla was strengthened on mid-day, translated by 65.66 to the US dollar and with .98 to the Moscow Bursa at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency wined seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rounds for a dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of the rubbish was produced due to the reaction to investors to the current global market disorders from China's weight products, the possible increase in the US Federal Reserve rate and the exaggerated reaction to the eftin oil.
Brent Counts increased midnight with 61 cents, reaching 48.36 USD per baril.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) transactiond with 72 cents more, at 45.31 USD per baril.
CITIES MULT: The most likely rate of profits will grow in the United States at the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is likely that volatility should say its word, feeded by uncertainty on China and on the moment of the increase in the rate of federal profits, which will continue to give the tonne for oil prices and rounds," said for Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, expert in the monetary policy strategy on emergency markets established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the Russian currency enhancement.
The main Russian oil company Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began to buy rounds.
The global markets wait with the soul to mouth the decision of the Federal Reserve July, if it will grow or not.
The markets consider that it would not be what could be the first growth in the nine years of the US profit rates and have been translated at the larger prices of the midnight.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together at the drone traffic system
NASA already works with the US and with companies such as Google, Amazon and phone company Verizon at the design of a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has been established at EU level.
Cooperation comes as a result of a very expansive disturbance in relation to the possibility of a air collision between small drones and commercial aircrafts.
A new Forrester report describes the potential potential negative effect in the colours.
"Issue thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies by delivering or catching data in urban areas with large density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," mentions research.
Make a common set of protocols and air rules, the haos could be installed.
According to this O'Cat, Baroneas from the Lorzs Camera, the concern was enhanced on the foundation of reports on events to the limit of production of an accident and the operation of drone of the Bal stadiums, nearly nuclear centres and Eiffel Turn.
"In the last two years, over 400 calls made to metropolitan police have been linked to drones incidents," O'Cat.
What is the solution: building a system that follows all drones, especially those that fly to a height less than 150 metres, unless they are conducted by commercial pilots or amateurs.
“When more small drones perform commercial flights at low height, other than the level of pilot visibility, or even completely autonomous flights, it is necessary to separate air traffic management infrastructure to ensure complex operations, such as the delivery of collettes in cities,” she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as the design of the airspace, the methods of avoiding unfair and the wind, the management of the congestion, the planning of travel and redirecting through methods similar to the rules established for road traffic, such as signalization and gases.
They were trying to have a functional prototype p in 2019.
The drone industry is to explode in the European Union in the following years.
"We've already seen small and innovative SME companies in the United Kingdom that use these effects with significant effects in the energy, agricultural sector and media industry," says Lord Tariq.
In 2014, the Civil Airport Authority granted only 670 trade drones authorisations.
The European Commission considers that drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU in 2050.
Dislike button: why Facebook wants to know what triumphs you
“A Look Back” works similarly, gathering the most important time ( Facebook).
But what will this mean for many users in Facebook's frontiers, which are now more than the population of any country?
First, of course, a empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
Facebook's big value - approximately 240 billion USD after the last statistics - is due to the unimagined data quantity of consumers he holds.
Each interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you do are gathered and building a noticeable complex image, found in a permanent update, about your preferences.
This is primarily valuable for publicity agencies, which can use all these information to select carefully what to see the announcements on Facebook, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
A empathy button adds another set of data and, with a view to, opens a door for another type of publicity agents to use the platform.
While a sports company looks for which "a" is a national team of Balbal, charitable and promoting organizations want to address those who, for example, "empatize" with the crisis of resources.
It will also change what you see in the News.
Facebook uses incredible intellectual and sophisticated algorithms to restrict that enormous universe of content that you could see, in the smallest flow you actually see.
This algorithm depends essentially on what you have considered interesting in the past and, especially, what he has done to you.
Of course, there is in Facebook fear that many interesting posts, but unfortunately they don't enter the algorithm, because people don't feel that they should appreciate them.
However, if Facebook understands more about what you are suffering or makes you feel unfortunate, you might decide to remove this type of posts from the News.
Facebook has experienced in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional status and, especially, how this is transferred from one year to another.
Environmental reliefs call this "emotional contamination" and, even though it sounds left, it is probably just a simple Facebook test (and published with their agreement) to understand better how their platform works and if they can adjust the algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to happen with the empatie button at Facebook width.
The real work is how to decide to add one button to its services such speculations can produce.
The reason for this is that the decisions taken by Facebook - whether include the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have deep consequences today.
Now we have a significant part of life in the digital world, which we make to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another that brings a constant light for survival in the feroce Darwinian world of the social networks.
The decisions he takes, including on new buttons, will be the most possible to overflow in this course.
I think a lot of people can empathize this, and soon they'll have a button for this.
Biometric breasts can precipe crises to autism
During the ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have found that the signs of the body can anticipate these illnesses, sometimes violent, before it occurs, giving the assistants the opportunity to take measures.
The autism kids with which we work can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that's hurt the head or that "he's too stuck" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body sends us, and we need to do this in a bright and unintrusive way.
For example, simply visualization of colors in an application can show the level of agitation. The red can be used to warn about a change of behaviour, and blue for the lack of interest, giving them understanding that the assistant is flacked and needs stimulation.
Brother data can be collected in time and saved on a safe server, helping careers to understand the picture of the same way she responses to various activities and which would be the most difficult intervention.
I have to say clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magicals, they need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with manufacturers to continue developing this team, to be specific for autism.
The research was conducted by Jane Carolan, the director of clients from Virral Authistic Society, which will present within the Autech 2015 Conference on autism and ́e from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with serious autism, so as we work, you see different spectacular things that can lead to the quality of their lives assistance. Now, applications for iPad give, at your own, a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help your children to learn to play your hidden.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technology can really change life and we feel that it is a part of our mission, as a careful autism organization, to ensure that all of us have this information and also become part of the debate how we want to support the future with autism.
Fran's going to attack Isis in Syria "in the next weeks"
In the following weeks, the French war airplanes will launch air attacks to the Isis tents in Syria, announced Wednesday, only a few days after President François Holland stated that the intervention was a "necessary".
France will cause the first air attacks of the yoadist group the State islamic in Syria "in the next weeks", stated the Minister for the opinion of Jean-Yves Le Drian on Thursday.
The French air forces deduct recognition missions in Syria of 8 September, and the attacks will follow “in the next weeks, after we have clearly identified tents”, Le Drian said for the Radio France Inter radio post.
Le Drian stated on March in the parliament that the State Islamic had made "increasing progress" in Syria, especially in the North Alep region.
"In the sea's holiday there is a extremely powerful official, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call Liberian Syrian Army or Syrian national coalition or what is left from it," he said.
Fran日 is part of a United States coalition, which a year bombs Isis positions in Iraq, but the Holland has changed the strategy last week to expand the actions in Syria, in its political pressure, in the Southern threatening Fund that is confronted with Fran.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and Golf States have already been involved in the attacks of Isis military in Syria.
IOS 9's locking characteristic will make the phone to be faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is launched mid-day and contains many new features.
One of the most useful owners of iPhone - and careful for online editors - is the ability to easily block announcements during the web navigation.
The new function will allow users to download thirds that block cookies, reclames, pop-up windows and other types of publicity during the use of the version for the Safari browser mobile.
At the tests, it was shown that after the locking of the reclamations, news sites such as New York Times are loaded two times faster, according to Re日s.
It also helps users to maintain their use of data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from more lock options of reclame, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular tool for locking ads for the desktop, launched its own iOS web browser that limits the reclamations; the Creator intends to start in the future a browser for Safari.
People who use software to block claims have a few constraints.
Reclamations are still shown in applications (after this guest Apple money on iOS).
More more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such an announcement blocking features.
However, the degree of their use on desktop computers increased by almost 48% in the year.
The deceiving them is a great challenge for online media, which is mostly offered to consumers free and supported for many years through publicity.
A report says that the blocking of claims could cost online editors almost 22 billion incomes generated from claims only this year.
To enable blocking reclames in iOS 9, users need to download a application for blocking the reclames, then to 日 Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to enable a content blocking.

Arctic countries are great enough to get a carrier
Many studies have evidenced the species that have become more vulnerable because of the climate, but the global weakness has been good for others.
One of these advanced species is the arctic country.
According to the researchers of the College Dartmouth, the warmest temperatures in the arctic region allowed countries here to appear before and grow greater, leading to their population.
A new study, researchers from the Centre John Sloan Dickey for the Internal Intelligence of Dartmouth, experts in the arctic region, used their observations from the territory to illustrate the effects of the temperature changes of the arc countries.
Their analysis predicts an increase of 50% of the survival rate of the country of adults in a 2-grade Censius temperature level.
The countries are small, but they represent the important members of the arctic trophic band and the eco.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B - aims to help the biological anticipation better how a growing country population could affect the caribbe with which they are feeding, birds and insects that are feeding with them and plants that they pollen.
To build their demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth combined their outcomes from the territory with the results of experiments that investigated how the temperature affects the insect deceleration and the predicted position to be sold by farmers.
Although the growth of the temperature makes the larger countries more vulnerable to the coleopters, it also offers them a time start in front and makes their larves to be faster and faster, that is, of course, a advantage.
More countries are a greater population, which can be determined, but only in the way they can support the sources of food of insects.
The ability of countries to transform their survival rates to a collective reproduction rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
The antidepressives taken during the task do not affect the child
Three new studies show that the administration of antidepressives to pregnant women does not affect the neuronal or behavior of their children.
The results indicated that selective inhibitors of serotonine recovery (SSRI) represent a growing risk of postpartum blood, but researchers have concluded that depression represents a higher risk for women and their children, therefore treatment should be treated.
“These studies are a set of more evidence regarding the administration of antidepressives during the task”, stated in a press communication by John Thorp, adjudged editor of the Internal Journal of Obstetric and Ginecology, which published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, the evidence seems to appear that the risks of untreated depression are greater than the higher use of antidepressives.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health has coordinated a study on the engineering of children whose moms have been treated with SSRI, analysing the data of 51 404 children from the Norwegian cohort of the mother and child, investigating the effects of the use of SSRI to determine the ability of motor vehicles at age of 3 years.
Researchers discovered that 381 SSRI mothers used during the tasks, and 159 of them were treated with medically a longer period.
Although the exposure to SSRI was associated in a few measures with a late delay in the motor disorder, researchers wrote in the study that the association “is not so significant as to give a clinical importance to pass.”.
A group of researchers from the University of Adelaide from the Adelaide has conducted an examination of data for 49,000 women from the Danish National Cohort of Native Natives to discover the effects of SSRI administration of children's behavior at age of 7 years.
It discovered that depression netted to pregnant women was associated with a growing risk of behavior problems.
In 210 children whose mothers treated against SSRI depression had no increased risk of behavior problems, compared to 231 children who were more predicted to behavior problems such as hyperactivity, attention and socialization problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also discovered in a separate study that mothers are more predicted to blood after birth if they are treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 indicated that the risk of postnatal hemorragies increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe hemorrage or postnatal anemia was doubled, reported researchers.
Researchers said that, although the study linked SSRI to increased risk, there is a large number of variables - from medicals taken during birth to the limited quantity of information received by researchers on the specific medical diseases of women - which could have been affected on the potential of blood.
"It is likely that women who took antidepressives in an advanced stage of the job to be the most serious stage of the disease, and that is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal hemorragies, not antidepressives," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor of the University of Adelaide.

I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew took her back to the flight, said the woman again.
A prosecutor told the jury that it was possible that Matthew was afraid of the ships of a car that entered in a parking nearby.
He was condemned years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew's going to get sense in October.

President Putin was transformed into a friend of O's in an enemy and was characterized as a tar.
It is portrayed as a dictator who removes the Russian Opposition and has reached power through non-democracy means, despite the choice of the elections of the Democratic elections, and the O's owned to re-react that the elections were democratic.
Now, I'm not democratic anymore.
"This is Western propaganda," pointed the leader of lac.
Not at last, this included Russia on the list of friendships - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate against terrorism, Iran and Iraq, "for they agree with the same type of terrorism".
Instead, Bashar al Assad criticized Turkey, another strong nearby, as well as President Recept Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said "I can't even make a move without coordinating the United States and other western tariffs."
Moreover, the presidents of Syria accused "the international coalition", which led by the United States, fighting against terrorism: "When this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State began to expand."
In other words, the coalition has been exhausted and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western Tarses, which ensure a covering for terrorism, such as France, the United States or other, cannot fight against terrorism.
You can't be with the opposite of terrorism at the same time.
"But if these talents decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in the buzz, you will understand - then we have no objective to cooperate with all these tariffs, since it is a real and not coalition, which would fight against terrorism," said the leader of the lac.
Toamna?
Nothing.

Tar map with the biggest yeftin and how Romania stands
The pursuit of oil cottage has caused large losses in the last year of workers to extract the title, energy company shares and tariffs that are very dependent on this resource.
However, there was also a positive effect: the benzine was effected enormously.
A map compiled by Bloomberg appears that, in October 2014 - July 2015, almost all the 76 tariffs calculated, the fuel price has expired.
The most important price reduction is observed in Venezuela.
In this street, the engine was 97%, so you can feed 24 US with less than a dollar.
In the robbery, there is Saudi Arabia, where the price is held fixed as a state.
The cost of the engine varies from the rare to the raffination conditions, as regards the taxation, and the fluctuations of the currency.
For a more precise comparison, Bloomberg transformed the average price from each state to US dollars.
Romania
Bloomberg data appeared in the second trimester of the year, the average price of a gas gallon (approximately 3.8 litres) was $5.49.
So, we're classified at the 27th place in the round of the gates with the best fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The latter trimester girl in 2014, the benzine was also efficient to Romans.
Then, the average price of a galon was $6,14, which means a decrease of $10,6%.
All of us, the bills around are still better.
In Bulgaria, a gas gallon is about $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
The hosts put the way for the immigrants in the midnight: What Merkel promised
The German canceller Angela Merkel promised, on Thursday night, that the Federal will give additional exhibition to the 16 countries of the Federation in receiving and distributing the tens of thousands of people in the south of Europe.
After approximately 4 hours with pre-ministers in the 16 federal states, Merkel stated that "the most important thing is now to create a ordered and transparent process to make the girl of the large number of re-reservates," noted the DPA agency.
She added that the federal will create 40,000 places for the initial sos, as well as the distribution centre.

Intersectly, you have to provide a massive impulse to make the girl of the crisis, addicted Merkel.
The first countries requested more assistance than the 6 billion euros convened by the federal coalition in the past more than one week.
Prime Minister of Turingie Bodo Ramelow from the Stanga Party requested a sum of "small double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local journal.
At the random or, the Prime Minister of the Renania-Palatinat country, Malu Dreyer, insisted that its powers were rapidly integrated into the German society.
"We need a national package between all players, not only the federal, states and municipalities, but also the activities, syndicates and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also requested the bureaucracy in manipulation of his reactions and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland concluded the processing in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Prime Minister of the country of Badá Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
Since now, Ba’a gate is the hardest poverty, with the most numerous came after they passed the border with Austria.

Mircea Lucescu makes scandal after humble infrastructure with Real Madrid
Lucescu's mildness was a nervous car at the end of the rain with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman Antrenor seemed totally determined by arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost intrusion was defavorized.
Before I said one thing, I want to be respected.
Of course, in Europe's important teams, we are always defavorized by arbitration.
There are two complete ways.
The new is given to us a galben carton immediately, while the top teams are not.
Moreover, the first penalty wasn't in any case!
Mingea shot Darijo behind without touching his hand.
A similar level of game was not supposed to be influenced by arbitration.
"Recorded that the arbitration has switched the game," said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
"Mrs., but what amazing is this?"
They were kitchens of the tranched husband.
A crime of a sadism out of community threatened the residents of Târgu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, in the first hours of the day, the chairs of Târgu Frumos were able to see territory scenes on the main market income.
In the three tombs, criminals "combined" from the kitchens that seemed to be the body of a boy.
It was tranched, but they missed the head, the internal organs and the genitals.
Finally, it would be proved that it was the body of an ex officer, who was tranched by his wife, the teacher of the geographic.
"Isi's Zirl" was talking to the fair even with the taximetrist who helped the criminal, without knowing, on the way of the sacks with the end of the body.
This story makes you a kidnapped kid.
The one who warned the police yesterday about the fact that a woman whose three sacks were worried, after cooks from the fusher body found on the market, was a taximeterist in Târgu Frumos.
Like in the American movies, the man helped himself to transport sacks full of human kitchens that were hard, but not to know, the criminal being a customer for a course.
The taximetrist said, in the case of "Isai's Zirl", the shocking scenes through which he passed, helping unless he wanted a murder to hide evidence.
It was running with the hands of his bags where the body kitchens of the man of the teacher of the geographical teacher, which he traced.
She came to Târgu Frumos to hide the evidence of crime as far as her home, from Roman.
Maybe he's got mines.
I didn't have anywhere you know.
Mother Mihai, like her friends who practice the taximeter in Târgu Frumos, became looked at the night in the small town in which he lives.
He saw American films throughout life, but he never thought he would ever be the one himself who would stand on the basis of discovering a sad crime, and he'd look with his eyes cooked by the body.
It refers to that, on Monday night to March, it normally expects the arrival of cars that transit regularly the locality.
This is nearly the intersection of the roads to Romans and Pascani.
The taximetr indicates that the murderer observed her in the retrovisor looking, lamping the sacs with the body cooks of the indicator who shows the nearby places.
She came the night with Massaro's course from 1.30.
The car left it at ten meters from the paskans, exactly at the beach where the milk is shown.
The sacks were packed with the indicator.
After the car went away, I gave it in the wallet for ten meters.
I threw the portbagage and after I put a sack, I asked, "Mrs., but what amazing is this?"
I saw she was a old woman, and I told me to help her.
I thought he was taking meat on the market, sometimes, maybe he had mines, I didn't know where to know.
I've been thinking that she might want to cut someone with that mixed meat.
She tried to lift up a sac alone, and I repeated to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the sack, where he was connected.
"He specificated me to take her to the big market gate, when I took her from the car," she started talking to Mihai's mother.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He concluded that the woman didn't say anything absolutely, and, therefore, he didn't have to ask her anything anymore.
I didn't talk to anything, because I was nervous that I was throwing my holiday in my car.
And when he put his bags down from the car, I noticed that he was amazing and worse.
She's put down the bags from the portbags.
When I came back into the car, I gave two meters back to return, and I realized that I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the portbagage decked and moved the car out and here to lose the mirror.
At the car, I didn't see if someone was helped to cover the bags, because I was behind and I didn't see well in the watch.
"They were two plastic sacks and one rafia," the man completed.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, it says he began to make his curiosity.
In my mind, I realized that something isn't in it.
After he gave his bags down, I went to hospital, to Primature, and when I returned, I forgot to see what the woman did with the bathroom.
She traveled between the bathroom after guard, where the inside of the market are.
Then we left again.
It was a little agitatation because a microbus came from Italy and a car.
I saw how the woman went to those drivers to go into them, go away, but probably the drivers didn't want to take it, because they had international courses, and they didn't take passengers from the opportunities.
The woman was very aggressive, walking around and here.
At a moment, the woman entered Peco and, in a curious way, I asked a employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered me he went and split up his hands.
Then I asked him where the police quarter was, because I saw her a while ago.
I looked for them and found them coming to the market.
I loved the woman and I told them that it was a misunderstanding thing.
"When I went to the other side, a course at Belcesti," Mihai completed.
He told us that the woman had become agitated after she left the bathroom on the tops.
At me, the suspicion went away from the fact that the bathroom was divorced, and I was wonderful what he did with him.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what they were doing there, and they looked at me, saying that I told her that he had a suspicious bathroom.
Then, the woman went to the throats and cut their bathroom.
"I returned to the place where he hid the sacs about 3 hours when I gave statements to the police and the prosecutors from the place," he completed his taximeter report.
Professors in Neamţ, who investigate the case, say that the teacher of 64 years, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the rooms to take views of a benzine from Roman at 0.55, walking with the three sacks in the car.
She arrived to Târgu Frumos at 1.30 p.m.
According to investigators, she would have killed her husband, who was married for four years, with a kitchen, and then dropped him into the house.
The man named Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was officer in the reservation.
Thursday night, the woman put the body bottles in two plastic sacks, which he brought to the car, and hid them.
In the evening, he transported another one, then decided in which direction to go, and chose the car Bucuresti - Iaşi.
Tonight, the prosecutors didn't know where the woman hided the husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found in the newspaper and putting, in a department of the woman's apartment.
She was pensioned, as her husband.
Last night, the prosecutors didn't find out from a woman who was the reason why he killed her husband with such a heavy blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be psychically expertized, and the body will be examined by legal doctors to determine officially the cause of death and any other relevant details.

Radu Gyr and Eliade
Continuing the description of files from the "dosar" of the political symptoms of the youth of Mircea Eliade, which would, in condensation, have been presented by the size of a quotidian article and must be dispersed in the series, it deserves, the evocate friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the oldest accusations captains used by the Great Savant Romans.
A less immoral description would, hopefully, be useful in the real debate that recently said "antilegionary", would be called to break it into the Roman intellectual environment.
Analysing critical versions that spoke of Eliade's regulation in Legiune through the Cube "Axa" and Radu Gyr, Florin Türcanu brings into discussion, in the volume of Mircea Eliade.
The historical prisoner (B.U., 2003), another hypothesis, which is most interested in the understanding of the reception of the postal contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after playing the Czechish "balcony scene" in August that year.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the security investigation, in 1941, documents stored today in the SRI archive (FD, Dossier 573, f.15) as well as on a follow-up note of 1938, Florin Ţurcanu claims that "Eliade will not enter their group, but also "legionary family" called Lumini, a group of intellectual cubics, especially writers, leading by Radu Gyr poet."
As regards the world's cup there is no sort of verifyable data, the exiles considering exists in this "legionary" family, what must be put in discussion is, as follows, the context in which this information was recorded in the folder.
Leaving to a surprising part of the SRI to provide these secret documents to Mr. Turkkanu, it is more evident that the follow-up of the Security was at that time the "Commandant" Radu Gyr, the mention of Eliade, in the context of which Armmand Cálinescu, the Minister of Interne, received freely to take all measures necessary for King Carol to impose the Kingdom Dictature, suspending the life of Parliament and eliminating the main political force of legionaries that began to be initiated by an unexpected popularity (The Part of All for the Great Trials of 1937).
The arrest of Eliade was made as follows of this note, quoted by Türcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, in 1935 in the Legionary Movement in the group of writers and poets under the leader of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr."
As regards me, I see this note as an underlying biocratic coverage for the repression of 1938 and it is probably that such superficial notes were made at the repeal for the major majority of the active legionaries or sensitives in the public space that were to be arrested, but that they had to be associated with a major legionary leader.
The olographic declaration of Radu Gyr remembered above, in prison, in February 1941, after legionary revoltation, does not only confirm it retrospectively at first, the bananal covering method in any police regime, authorist.
It would be interesting if Türcanu would have provided more details about the content of the document 573 quoted.
Was Eliade or Radu Gyr's file?
Because anyway it needs to be a folder built on the basis of the security documents, but then the Security to be used once against the other.
There is an equivoc here, as in the use of the term of "member" of the Mouse, which only someone who knows the accommodation of the internal activities of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that he is a preserving stage, of evidence, in which it is conducted as an active, found in the trial period of trials before being "camarad" with acts in the regulation.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as the clubs or the intellectual cells, seats, discussion groups with countries, teenagers or students in the area of a cub, were "family", they were not a pleasant club said, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of notion is completely escaped by the unvisible reader by making the "member" status of Eliade (what may be pleasable) to be comprehensive and used at letterram to design the political regulation in the cub.
Of course, invocation of subtilitated interpreters of this genre cannot hide the public activity of Garz's exhibition and no clear compassion for the Captain who animated Eliade during the period 1935-1940, whether in the town of Nae Ionescu or not.
The public support of a case that you believe does not mean, however, as necessary, and the political regulation proposed in so far as, of course, the intellectuals of this tax are a type of superiority to the activists as an attachment and not to politics than when they are directly offered by high privileges.
As long as I could make a view of Eliade's kind of thinking in that period, in which he was "the leader of the young generation," I'm hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchy rigories in a legionary cub.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascender, however!
To not more, than in the past, the fact that, in any "legionary" folder, what it receives is an antisemmed public activity as well as violen, both devoted to be stigmatised, but unexistent in the case of Eliade, p' to our tests.
As regards the correspondence of Eliade-Gyr from 1968 - 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic apparent of Eliade, trys to sanctify Florin Ţurcanu's responsibility (but based on no archive documents, even if it had been deemed to be discouraged and constantly severe) with an argument, however, discussable.
In the volume of Our glossed Mircea Eliade (B日uristis, 2006), Manoca finds that "no one of the correspondents of Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr does not contain any anxiety to this frame".
He hadn't even been like in 1968 when Radu Gyr couldn't have risked any allusion in a letter that, obviously, was intercepted by censuring.
What I think he wanted to highlight Myrcea Handoca is the fact that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, amazing and affection without any doubt of Eliade's rise.
There's not really the most palid suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been the boss of Eliade.
Intelligent, the poet obliged to write to the Glass of Patria, devoted from the head of the place by signing Eliade (which knew very exactly what mission had the mission that was occupied with the denigration of the right exhibition), in signing, after "Your old friend", to what it would be seemed and is visible and happy when it replied ashamed after almost three decades of divorce since the "life of the time" was endeavored to them.
There is no doubt that, besides the "mission" with which he was married (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he might be quiet even to see his mother and friends) and that he, ablely, makes it sec and by short provisions, separated from paragraphs, to suggest their character of foreign body, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for the damage.
Nothing about the ezotheric allergies, raffined political complications suggested or any evocation of the years of youth in another register than the cultural.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been higher than Eliade's legionary line, but for the consolidation of this version with less circumstances evidence than those offered by Florin Ţurcanu, we have in these corresponding memory cibs that testify a mutual price of individuals who have marked, but a staturnic, our culture, and who, in addition to the complete tests of life, have the tone of civilization and interble education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, regarding for the form of friendship and respect mutually instead of the "under-time" destination of the authors.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally refuses to the state of repair by obtaining the American citizenship and, under the pretext offered by health problems and disasters of inundation, announced the authorities of the RSR through the ambassador (with which it has a sporadic correspondence used to get passport for her sister), that it cannot curse the invitation to return to wedding.
The following was predictable: it is replaced to index, it is mounted in Israel "Toladot business", the books sent to the family and friends (Fragments of a journal, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped with censuring, never reveal their mother.
One of the friends in the wedding only with Noica has a sporatic responsibility, although, in surprising manner, as it tests a personal archive from Chicago, a lot of particular or Roman institutions are more able to send messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr hasn't received the permission to write it after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Czech Republic tried the second conviction operation of Eliade (with official invitations, Noica's demers, translators, etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed in prison.
New Antrenor, foreign player
Because of the autohtone volivalist penure, Penicilina Iaşi tested in sport tours in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Outsides participate in preparation tours under the entrepreneur Dan Gavril's command
Retrograded in the first half of the year of the Women's Division A1, Penicilina Iaşi kept his place in the first ease due to the retraction and then the department of the formation Știin日 Miroslava, promoted in the first ease in a bargage tour even in the common exhibition.
The news took less on the indispensable leader of the outside group, who was surprised without the main trainer (double leave of Rareș Puni, reached to Sciin` Bacau) and many missing players, some retraces such as Cristina Lungu and the liberal Diana`neu, or gone, like Ana-Maria Berdilla (the campionary of Vola Blaj) and the sisters Maria and Julia Fica.
In fact, for the restart of the planned campaign on 10 October, there was still a time to complete the lot.
First, a new trainer was found in Dan Gavril, coming from the masculine LPS Piatra Naamţ team and worked at Penicilina less recent years, which would soon sign a contract with the grouping of Vasile Stán.
Due players were brought from Sciin Miroslava, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diacony, being tried and some foreign players in Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, nearly transfering Catarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, Franʹ) and the Montenegro Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of Monday, the Peniciline Lot led by Dan Gavril performed a cantoning at Gura Humor, after which he participated in a tournee held in Lugoj and joined the Cupa Banat, where the outcomes made a victory (3-0 with the University of Cluj), but also suffered two challenges, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMUØIOV.
The week you have, in the period of 23-25 September, Penicilina will participate in another tour, in the field.
For the new campions, we're trying to get a valuable team.
We have a comprehensive and experienced trainer, but the player fund in Romania is quite reduced, and therefore we will call to foreign volunteers, especially after the decision that teams can use an unlimited number of players outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports from Romania's clubs.
"We hope to reach the end of the competitive year at 5-6 places, even if it will be very hard," mentioned, Vasile Stán, President of Penicilina Iaşi.
Emotional event.
Games gathered after almost 70 years
Gemen George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, in the age of 69, were born at the finals of the World War II in Germany, after their mother of Poland origin was almost released in a workplace.
Because she was too sick to care for her, the gentlemen were sent to Poland to adoption, the two brothers were so separated not only from the one who gave them life but also one of the other.
Ten years ago, George and Lucian didn't know one of the other.
At the age of 17, George discovered the documents that showed that it was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the 1960s, he asked the Red to help him embrace his brother, but they didn't discover anything to lead them to Lucian.
Abia in 2015, the grace of the program, "Restoring Family Links" of the Red, the gentlemen repeated, and the time was one more than emotional.

Each of us has learned from the repository of the other and, what is very important, is that the sounds of the two instruments can be able.
Florentin: "I know there's a spring between classic and the rest of music people."
I think a lot of people can do classic music.
And the second time we stole a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rocks, and, well, jazz.
We want to cut the point between the genes, we want to offer a kind of music that could do to those who were only his classic music and rock, and those who just rocked to come to love and classic music.
And we had the surprise to tell us at the end of a concert that they never imagined that they would do something like that and they would like it.
Cristis: "When we go young -- and we get out of what more -- who I know who Pink Floyd was, we seem to be amazing."
The students in Iaşi have been more in traffic than at school in the first day after vacation
Hundreds of outsides were "captives" yesterday morning in the infernal traffic in many areas.
The premium announced that from today the Mangeron Bulevard (splai left Bahlu mal), between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș.
The Chiefs of the Primation did not comply with their promises to carry out works for the fluiding of the trading once after the school year.
One of the assurances that the municipality gave them, at least two times in the last weeks, refined the turning in the Internal Gaza area.
Although only a few provisional elements were required to be mounted, and the last time of work was the end of last week, the turnover was not performed yesterday.
The driver's nerves were maximally extended to Nicolae York and Cantemir, taking into account that another promise of the Primation was distorted: the movement of the customs activities from Nicolae Iorga to the Tehnopolis "the latest for the end of August" in the context of this transfer is still discussed in 2012.
Currently, Mihai Chirica's interim leader says the problem of the Internal Gara is more complicated.
The rotation will be made at the right time, we need to take account of the tramways in the area, we need a opinion from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tramway to walk in the giracy, but we'll solve it in a way," said Chirica.
One of the solutions, according to this, would be the stop of the tramway with a semafor before turning.
Problems in action were also intersected in Podu Roş.
The car rental on the street of the Saint Lazarus was spread at the SRI seat.
"I've been waiting for a good minute to get out to Podu Rosh," said an exean.
In September, Podu Roş had to travel to the CUG if the "Dez and rehabilitation of the functional artery" project was completed during the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complete the initial.
"We have drawn European funds for new works, for example overload, on the initial basis the Nicolina passport was stuck," commented Chirica.
The latest time for the re-transduction of tramways is October.
During yesterday, the exhibitions signed problems in particular traffic in areas such as Pácurari, Centre (Târgu Cucu, India, Armenian Street) or the intersection in Baza 3.
Domains could return as a boss to CJ.
In the morning, you'll know.
The judges of the Court shall decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Judean Council will be maintained by the Jewish control and prohibitions.
The Masters of the Court of Justice have resolved a new term yesterday in the "Album" folder where the President is accused of the Judecean Council Iaşi.
At the end of the yesterday meeting, the magistrates have been able to pronounce themselves during the morning on the measure of Judicial control currently imposed against the Adoption.
This finally wants to live or revoke this measure, which holds it away from the CJ's head's throne for more months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if this will be noted and of the above instance, Christian Advocacy will be able to rename CJ's Chairman's function.
The adoption was sent in Judice by the Anti-DNA National ruption Directorate (DNA), being accused of promoting the manufacturer and intellectually after, for curories, it would have been tried to mask a audit control in order to discover a series of irregularities concerning the receipt in a public contrast signed between CJ and Laser Co.
The decision would have tried to hide the fact that the institution that led it would not have received more materials to promote the Iaşi Jewish, although these materials were written to be received by CJ.
It has already been different from the CJ justice and three directors, but also the Laser Co administrator.
More than 3.500 outcomes are expected to vote on 25 September
The premium is prepared to distribute other issues, if the 12.000 will be epulated.
The exhibitors have only ten days to express their opinion on the replanting of the teas on the Great Stephan.
According to the officials of the municipality, about 8.500 of the 12.000 issues distributed to the cartridge centres and in other three additional points in the city (Copou park, Alexandru the Bone and Primatione).
A record number of outputs was presented on Sunday before the Primation.
According to the representatives of the civil group "Isha loves the teas", 530 outputs voted in 140 minutes, respectively nearly four votes expressed each minute.
Instead, during the whole monthly day, at the same place came about 440 outsides.
The volunteers of the group say that many outcomes reclaim signing and people of the public consultation ineffectively.
Therefore, they made a call to the Internet users yesterday to draw a group information show and to put it into block scans.
The volunteers also recognized that at the additional point of the park Copou, the last formulation was completed by Sunday outcomes.
We'll offer formulaes from the cartridge centres, where it's not too completed.
"Eventual additions we will do when all 12.000 formulaes will be completed," said the municipality's vocabulary Sebastian Buraga yesterday.
"Speak new teas" will be completed on 25 September, and if the majority of the outsides is in favour of the replanting of the trees, the Primation will plant your money in this town.
The exhibitors can express their opinion on the cartridge centres in Dacia, Famoasa, Tatterraşi, Nicolina and Pecurari, as well as in the additional points mentioned above.
The Chiefs of the Primaries decided to drive the teas from Stéphan the Great at the beginning of 2013, which took an amendment of 60,000 leies to the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without consultation of the population, and went to the spontaneous appearance of the civilian group "Isha loves the teas", a online community which includes about 13.500.
In the middle of the civil group for the replanting of the teas was signed on yesterday evening from over 9.100 supporters.
RECORD of students registered at USAMV Iaşi!
I'm 920 in the year I.
University has 920 students in this year in the year I.
The representatives of the University of Scientific Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" claimed that this year were the most admissible candidates ever, in the history of the higher education institution, from the end.
We're very thankful for the results of this year from admission.
We have the largest number of candidates in the university history, nearly 920 students in the first year. We never had a number like this.
"We had and candidates with greater media, we occupied our places from the license and master budget," said Prof. John Ţenu, prosecutor with diplomatic activity.
It higherly indicated that the university has registered a significant number of students at tax, occupiing 20% of these places, a significant number greater than in other years.
Although the results were published in the Roman language study lines, the advice continues to the English study programme from the Veterinary Medical Faculty, which has brought out 50 places, where the tax is EUR 5.000, and now the Ministry is expected to confirm the documents of students and studies needed.
At the tomb session, 120 documents were allocated to the 14 buckets and 209 to the license studies.
The most files were transferred to the Agricultural Faculty, in number 75, were 23, and in Zootehnie, 22.
At the master's 18-house session, at the 150 tax places proposed by the USMV, seven of them in the agriculture, five at Horticulture and six in Zootehnie.
The boss fear that he enters the car rounds in the crops of Tudor Vladimirescu pool
The pool over Bahlu from the Tudor Vladimirescu bulevard remained as surrounded as when the "Year de Iaşi" wrote about the problems he presented, 10 days ago.
Our daily reporters then signed that on the axis that delimits the two senses of pass the asfalt was left, opening adequate graves, some even 20 metres, which means the beton areas that represent the primary pool infrastructure.
The asfalt also started to be seen by the one and the other side of the axis, including signs that the advances will be accented.
At this time, the Mihai Chirica Interim Primary claims that the pool has no problems, making a technical expertise recently, in order to start a rehabilitation project of powder and tramway, in value of EUR 5 million.
First Chirica states that the area affected by fissures and gropes will be signed, so that asfalt resources should be made quickly.
The only measures taken for now have been to mount pops and signing benzens, without even a simple floor.
In this period, we focused more on the discovery of schools and works necessary for this purpose.
"It's a pointal expertise for the pool we're waiting for in particular a week with the details necessary for the intervention, I appreciate that in two weeks we could go to remediation," said the interim primary.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my big son, Stefan, started school.
It's prepared, as he's trying to improve the operation.
I don't know if I'm going or if I'm leaving melancolies; I'm low, pass, to the second variant.
First, because I feel that they have been three weeks, not three years since I took him for the first time, with emotions, to the department.
Although it feels easily, no normal parent seems to be growing children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day of my childhood; then it began a story that, in the morning, didn't end today.
I wasn't exactly what it usually calls a conscious student.
In fact, I would.
But my school has always been.
So much, that I've chosen to continue, even if I was a teacher.
When I decided that it was what they wanted to do all my life, I knew it wasn't a easily mistress.
And no one with a mix anyway.
That's because, as each of us, I've given myself over all the teachers: better or worse, more sensitive or insuffisable, more insatisfactory or imbecil right.
Unfortunately, there are people with other calls in this brass.
I think they're toxic because they're leaving the enthusiasm and even the mind of a t'r ready to form itself.
I had the wedding to give, as long as I was student or student, over a few, little, cups.
These meetings can be decided if they are at the appropriate time.
Who thinks that the role of the cathedral is the banish transmission of information is bitter.
This can be done to anybody; informedly, it can be informed the elder very well about one one, that we just live in the time of transparency.
But a good teacher models the mind of the students.
He's sharing them, he's planning their thinking.
Stay at the cathedral isn't a privilege, as I think, but a big responsibility.
Young ones are very moftrose, needed, unforgiving, and always ready to look for those who are in their faces.
That's how the age is, the temperature.
In teenager, all of us believed that we knew everything, that we had certainty of uncleanness about everything.
When we get married, we get to understand that we have only doubts.
That's why a teacher's role is to throw the teenager out of the category of self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, he's going to get to doubt, ask questions.
To discover the answers, whether they and the provisions.
To be involved in everything he does.
To direct it to the profitable models.
It's very difficulty, especially that the elder thinks that the teacher is his enemy.
One who's just trying to catch him wrong to sanctify him.
But that justifys him, the pure, the revolver, because he lives with his old calls, looking at him from the cathedral with suspect.
It just doesn't have how to accept the natural attempt to order it.
Adults are not allowed at the point, they are not accepted to impose restrictions.
Anyway, if I'm impressioning that I do, they'll be disappointed.
And, of course, when there is a heavy cathedral, which is imprisoned by endurance and does not communicate, the students are guilty of the given object.
There are thousands of such adolescents who ratify the meetings with the large writers, of course, because of the lack of tact of the teacher of Rome.
There are thousands of those students who have the impression that the story is an extension of data, that the matematics are all that can be more obscure for their uncover mind.
I always encourage my students: if you give a teacher that you don't kiss, who doesn't know to communicate as a man with you, do not let him separate you from which you should be directed.
How'd it be that I've become myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classs.
He dismissed my mind to some texts that have spoken to the puber since then on his understanding.
I've met a college teacher who opened my library door.
I looked at him as a man in the other world: he had the walls of the house covered with throats of books.
I lost myself in his library and I dreamed to have one like that.
Now maybe I got it, but if I hadn't taken my sort in the way, I might have decided to make me a ballist.
Or an engineer or a lawyer or who knows what.
I don't think that's what I'm going to do.
I don't believe in danger.
It's essential to give you a man who takes you from me and directs you patiently to his own call.
And this is, most times, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me just talk about what it means to translate.
Only that it can't be delivered.
There's no teacher, so there's a mathematical teacher.
How do you put the inefficace in concepts?
You can, at least, make it appeal, without supposedly transmitting pesticide truths.
The cathedral can almost get reading, that's with everything else.
But especially there may be no wonderful meeting between a reader and a low book.
I'm meet who can change life's life.
I'm meet which can discover the mind, which can lift up, talking to someone, the soldiers on the eye.
Therefore, the teacher must first be able to make students understand that there is no divorce between life and life.
In fact!
A big thing, Al. Paleologist, one only appearing paradoxal thing: "How much, so life, not inverse!" and he had the right.
That's why a good dask prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in any area.
Unfortunately, we always have what to learn.
And we, teachers, or especially we, teachers.
Most times, only a great truth is repeated from inheritance: not only the disciples have learned from their teachers, but also the inverse.
In the ideal way, the teacher should be a teacher, and the teacher a disciple.
Which, like any valuable, looks like the teacher when he finds his own way.
It's just right.
But the teacher was the one who opened the scene.
I don't think there's greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than it's to endure so many divorces.

Instead of presenting the avenues of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Ciuperciles, the modified video game has it in the center on the "Region of Mario".

The best student is 15 years old at the Detection Centre and is in class I
The Ministry of Justice, Robert Cazanciuc, said, at the end of the year of school at the Detention Centre, that the best student is 15 years old and is in class I, and the greatest is 25 years old and is in the XI class, indicating that they could have another life if they were going to school.
We have chosen to participate in school year's discharge in a center of the National Penitentiaries' nationality to try to take attention, and thus some less realities.
The highest student, in age of 15, is written in class I, and the largest is 25 years old and is written in the XI class.
"There are complicated subjects that the society is concerned about to debat them at this point, we all are concerned about their own concerns and problems, but we do not need to pass through the lesson that you are more than 100 young people from the Detention Centre of Detectives," he said, Monday, Minister Robert Cazanciuc, to the discharge festival of the school year.
The Minister of Justice took attention to the fact that the educational lips, motivated in many cases of material opportunities, may lead to tragedy, indicating that young people in this centre would have had another chance in life if they could follow the foreign school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to know what the respect of the law means and what consequences may have its unrespect.
"The role of the penitential system is not that of the permanent isolation of people who have violated the law, to put them behind high walls, but to try to restore and prepare them, for when they return to the community, they have more chances of reintegration," Cazanciuc added.
The Minister claimed that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, paths, but to invest in penitential systems, because, in many cases, detentions are at the limit of humanity and that, in the light of money and staff, it will be difficult to speak of the reintegration of convicted holdings.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, each year, in the penitential system, are over 2000 students of school education courses.
Of course, we're not going to change the night that hasn't been done for 25 years, but it's the important steps we're doing.
"In all these departments we need to support the society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we do our debt, that these young people have a chance through your work and not a risk for society," Cazanciuc said.
The Minister of Justice has hated the success of both students and teachers, noting that the success is only by the associated effort of all.
"And because it is today the Festival of the Holy Holy One, I would launch all students and teachers the invitation to visit the muscles from Sweden, Maréstist, and not only to understand what the fight for ideals means," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian vote came with the horse
Doctoral schools taken with two beaches to be perfect!
Petition of prestigious universities in Iaşi and dziedre
Even 200 researchers, universities, personalities and students from raj signed an appeal launched by the Academic Society in Romania in which they requested the Ministry of Education and Research Scientific Assessment, Sanction and even discharge of doctoral schools in Romania "what allows and promotes academic imposition".
Among the signatures of the lansed petition on 10 September are also numbered diplomatic frames and teachers in Iaşi.
Among the signatory universities of the petition in the environment of the outsheean is, for example, and Prof. Liviu Antonesis.
At national level, the petition has names from the former ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, people of culture that are also university-dictionary frameworks, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Education Law provides the evaluation of the doctoral schools, this fact has not been currently performed by determining such specific sanctions for doctoral schools that flagrantly claim the ethical standards of scientific research and that does not produce relevant and re-evaluation at international level," it is stated in the initial petition.
In this request it is specifically requested to comply with the National Education Law, to evaluate doctoral schools, to suspend the functioning right for any doctoral school in which more than two plagues were found, in order to evaluate and remediate.
The last requirement is to suspend the functionality right for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctorate leaders laid down by law to comply with the criteria set out by the National Research Council in 2011 for the eligibility for the grants of the IDEI projects.
Do you respect at least a general without doctorate, or a politician, or a informative agent in the Middle East?
"Why is there not in Europe any other people who will give doctorates of secret services, and the chief militaries who give their doctors do it to self-emics institutions, where the quality is checked by the environment of `emic'?", said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, President of the Roman Society, the initiative of the Petition, originating in Iaşi.
This can be completed by all wishes on the Society's Internet page, and final signatures will be submitted by organisation to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to be involved.
The "Pentru Iaşi" party, based on young non-political IT managers, was launched in the Copou Park.
The President of the initiative Group "Pentru Iaşi" granted an interview of "Isai's Zear"
It will have a dedicated party to the development of the city.
A group of political non-affiliated entrepreneurs and managers now launched at the end of the last week the Party for the same organization that will propose candidates to local elections of 2016.
Currently, the party's nuclear is formated by specialists in the IT area, but training initiatives say that in the organization all people will be welcomed to the modernization of the city.
The launch was on Sunday, in Copou Park, and in the event they participated more than 200 sympathisants, almost all young.
The special invitation of the action was Nicuşor Dan, President of the Association Salvate the Liechtenstein.
He was the surprise of local elections in 2012 when, from the position of independence, he was able to add 10% of the votes for capital primary function.
"The people I've seen at "Pentru Iaşi" think they're very good to access the public administration of Iash."
I believe in this initiative, I think he has a chance, I think he can have more chances in a smaller community than that in Bucuresti.
"I'll be always with "Pentru Iaşi", said Nicuşor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iaşi to work in a foreign IT company?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are more sensitive and emotional.
I was left in many short travelers, I lived in Cluj a year.
I came back every time, because I felt that there's my house.
ZDI: Why have you decided to finish a political party now?
Andrei Postolache:Now we have come to a certain maturity, we are a group of people we have started to know for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started to discuss how we could be involved.
At the beginning, we involved more timid, in smaller things, with projects in NGOs, various building or charitable actions, and, sometimes, things have developed natural and organic, and now has been the time when we reached the decision that we need to be more involved than that.
ZDI: Please call three concrete projects for the activity of local public administration!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum information on the premises activities so that departments, institutions and regions cooperate as better.
But more importantly, it can publish transparency data about detailed activities: bugs, reports, projects, etc. We speak of informal organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to itself.
If you have a project in a certain cartridge, it is important to the public consultation of the people affected.
If we're talking about, you don't have to forget the transport in common, we've got the biggest buses in the white.
You have to buy new transport means.
ZDI: Today, the picture of a city is extremely important.
How would you promote the Iash?
Andrei Postolache: You go up to the plane and look for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industrial events where you can "come" the city.
You have to want to do that and know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought clients to Iaşi.
Which is the brand of Iaš?
Andrei Postolache: My view is that we must be a city of the city, in some way.
We already have the IT industry and we have to expand it, go to medical, enter into the robotic area, in the 3D printing, continue in this spirit and unit such elements.
I think the brand should be in science area, I'm referring to the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Jasha has already this sign which doesn't have to change, as cultural cities.
I see the two elements in the balance: culture and.
ZDI: How will you compensate the experience lips in the public administration, as well as the traditional partial lips with which you still win the elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: The operation is a form of management, which means organization, planning, communication, work with people and project delay.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional. It's not interested in us.
We want people to be involved, we'll talk to everyone, we're not just Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have "volunters" brought with the bus.
That means we're based on people who really want to be involved and helped, and we think they're a lot of people like this.
ZDI: Is the Prime Minister of Iash more concerned about promoting the city's image at national and international level, or is it necessary that anxiety air continues to be built-in nature?
Andrei Postolache: One without another doesn't work.
First, you need to solve today's problems, urgency.
Or, if you don't do your town, if you don't take money in the city, at a moment you're without money and you're not able to do, for example, roads.
You have to do both at the same time, and you have to be competent to you.
Not the primary needs to do everything.
We need to reject the model of the primary daddy, which comes and bats with the pump in the table and solves everything.
No.
We're a team.
The first is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attach people from the IT area who can finance the party?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, to have an imperfect reputation, to be clearly integral and to be honest.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 100,000 people, or, why not, 300,000 who want to be involved and do something for the city.
Interview conducted by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache works in the IT industry for nearly 15 years.
In July 2015, Introspecials enterprise, after, seven years, was director in the internal matter of Endava (2008-2015), where a 300-person team was coordinated.
Other four years (2003-2007) came to Synygy.
The company which has funded with another IT specialist offers consultation services in management.
The Rabla Tractor Program has failed
The Director-General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Oltean, stated that the programme to stimulate the renewal of the national tractor and agricultural machines, started in 2011, named Rabla for Trade, was an error due to the bureaucracy.
Rabla's program linked, there were no tests in recent years, but it proved that it was a mistake, because the documentation was very working and complicated for a row farmer, and the approvals were too long and then the world rejected.
That program has been sold somewhere at 10 kitchens.
"The need for trade for Romanian agricultural would be 300,000 kitchens," said the Oltean Mircea.
According to this, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces a few hundred annual tractors, which is the greatest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by foreign companies, who know the needs of the Roman market.
It's a very great competition with those outside, all world producers' eyes on Romania, I know these things I told you, and they have special policies.
"In all markets is a big agglomeration, all producers exposing, coming with all kinds of variants," highlighted the Oltean Mircea, which indicated that IRUM Reghin produces a year of about 500 agricultural and forest trafficking.
By the Rabla Tractor Programme, started in 2011, those holding old tractors or other self-propulsed means, such as the combines, could deliver and replace a value ticket of 17.000 laws.
The red screen was thrown up.
The internal scrutin of labs seems more spectacular and significantly political, since the new election leader becomes automatically his head of launch in the victorious elections.
So the red-aprins/ Under his falls we will live and die.
This song, yesterday, Jeremy Corbyn in the London Sanctuary House pub.
He has been witnessing many facts and swearing - Let's not change his color now.
Readers who don't know the melodic line of this inofficial name of the British and International Left (The Red Flag) can find it on the Internet and would not be excluded to have part of a surprise.
With the discovered heads, let's swore with all of us that we're gonna take him down.
The author of these lines is not even a admirator of the red steaks (and not of those who flee) but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn will be able to join the left yesterday with the morning, this love story between him and the Laburist Party's base will be part of a happy end.
I don't think it's going to do so, but I think it's early to talk about the sea and inevitable electoral breakdown, over five years, of a chosen leader.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have attended a democratic exercise of an impressive distortion.
Not the British labs invented the system of vote directly for the leader of the party in the west left.
French socialists practice a more complicated system based on motions, which allows all members and compassionates to express; in addition, they have organized a preliminary competition for the nomination of the candidate to the presidential of 2012.
However, the internal audit of labs seems more spectacular and significantly political, while the new election leader becomes automatically his head of lance in the victorious elections.
It is, of course, a political system, personalization of power being more pronounced in the British Sea than the other part of the Manual Channel.
In addition, voting was great in all three "clocks": members of their own, members of the syndicates and other members of the party's members and, finally, the group of simpatitisants (that received the voting bulletin after a summary of the registration procedure).
This latest group provides interesting information on the perceptions of the left segments of the British society, especially the formats of young or older, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to use more, in the future, on the basis of the sign offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are no sociological investigations that tell us too much about the attitudes of this "external circle" labourist, so the precautionary speculation is allowed.
I think we meet a lot of similar attitudes with the Simpatitisants of Podemos (Spania) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the notice that they will park the traditional channels of the left.
If we keep to identify a vocation "anti", it first reflects by refusing the centralist line, New Labour (for many, just a decimal form of the multi-hulit thatcherism).
The second component would be the repayment of the leaders considered guilty of the two successful electoral failures, one of the arguments that have not gone enough to the left, that they have not delimited the lock of Tony Blair's time.
The second repeat - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum for the inside of Scotland.
If we abstraction the separate message and strictly focus on other political issues, we see how the Spanish nationalists have captured the energy of a favorable public segments of the social state and animated by the aspiration of equality, the destruction and the hosts of military involvement on courts, but always towards the new issues of the left: Propertyology, gen, assistance for poor countries.
The Spanish labs thus lost a electorate to which, at least in principle, should have a privileged position, but now I can recover (see their enthusiasm against Corbyn's campaign).
The same energy is over all in the United Kingdom, but the old leader couldn't attach them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his call outside, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, "Aristocrat" lab.
The comparison with Scotia tells us more, I think, than the anti-left anti-left of the South European perifer.
The term "anti" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems to me more appropriate.
For a week we'll find more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps, as a leader of the position.
We'll see if no red Steagul will rise in the Common Room (not for the first time), after the new leader will be occupied with his place, first to the banks of the position.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is the first one - and in this regard he has even reasons to be concerned.
Manufacturing capcane with or without good science
As I wrote, my article passed by my head to check on the net of the former lumpant and "the commander of Syrian Rebel Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin’s "jaadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jeadist" - could do me from the start of the circumspect).
I didn't.
In the last week article (Europe, between repeateds and "re-aeds"), I commented in the parallel two photos - the boyfriend Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean and, in fact, the two set it up on the Laith Al-Saleh Syrian once as a lump, the second time as re-refreshed.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh we took it out of the article "Syrian Lowerers come with the Valley of Reaculate" (signed by Viorica Marin in the Truth of 3 September).
On Monday night, I sent a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Marti, entering Facebook, found, among others, a hand trace from the friend (not only by FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, except a precaution. Laith al Saleh is not a jiadist."
In contrast, he's the opposer of Al Assad, for democracy and that.
"This is how you could love the gross manipulation in the table."
I need to recognize, I felt a naspa.
As long as I wrote, my article passed through my head to verify on the web of the former fighter and "Commandant of Syrian Rebel Laith Al-Saleh" became the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin’s "jaadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jiadist" - could do me from the start of the circumspect).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
Instead, I didn't have any other comment on Marius Cristian's hand tracing but: "I need to believe in the truth if I had (he had) trust in the truth."
After that, obviously, I took the money of the poverty and I felt due to readers with the right presentation of the Syrian history of Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest we found it in a material of the press (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader looking for Europe) signed by Nicholas Ba日tis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015 on the Cos Island of Greece, where they noticed it, among hundreds, may be, thousands of rehabed, on a boy who tries to make a ́s in the haos of the multitude.
The man was the Syrian spectator Laith Al Saleh of Alep, who "is usually to be at the command", while "he brought a 700 rebellion unit in the civil war of Syria."
Moreover, Al Saleh, in the age of 30, had "a house, a wife and a normal life before the start of the battle that had caught over 250,000 lives and put a third of the Syrian population on the roads."
In the interview given to the correspondents from the press, Al Saleh suggests that "all wants to leave Syria."
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
Almost 70% of the city is.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (a extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, and I wanted to fight against all.
In addition to the fact that it was given out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a meeting and a sign-lineer - with a man in which a Syrian enemy reacted": "Now two days, I saw a luneist of the forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very worried.
From the more material we know that Laith (which means lion in Arabia) was actually in the way to the Netherlands, where he had a bird - was a high officer in the Syrian army and then became rebel and came to O' after he was severely hurt - hopeing to get asyl and then to bring her family - wife and a three-year poor boy (approximately age with the civil war in Syria, which was exhausted in March 2011).
After this will be done, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue fighting for the Free Syrian Army (spoisoned by O©) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (russian) of the State of Islamic and of the Nusra's front of Al-Qaeda.
Whoever wants freedom must fight in Syria against not one enemy but three!
I gave more over a Serbian material of 22 August, which I didn't understand great things, just that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come once with them: TERORISTI SE KRIJU MEJU MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a news on http://www.telegraf.rs/vest, in which they are associated with Al Saleh with a barba holding a Syrian steag in mâ and that reacting to which the trick with "THANK YOU".
On 7 September, then, on the BBC site, Mike Wendling took attention to the case of manipulation with the helper of photos with the Syrian luxury: This viral photo-elély clássule to show an IS combater posing as a refugee - This viral pool requires wrong that it makes an islamic state lowering in repository.
We find out that the poza (in fact: photos - the with Laith with bar and weapons and the with the THANK YOU trick) was posted by a user on Facebook, which would have been his user and asked for excuses in time.
Only before this, just on his walls, the picture with the two photos would have been shaded by over 70,000 times, collecting a few thousand comments.
That talk, too late, the horse went away!
In Romania, on September 9, Carla Dinu from Hotnews took the story with the BBC manipulation, however, translating wrong the title: "A photo became the viral appearance of a ISIS lumpator.
Obviously, not the photo is, but the interpretation was an error, shortly: manipulation.
