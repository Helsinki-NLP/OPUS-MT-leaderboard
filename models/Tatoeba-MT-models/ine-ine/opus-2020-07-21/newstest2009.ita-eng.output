The Borsa of Prague at the end of the market has had a negative crowd.
After the morning crown, Praga's Borsa restored the losses.
The transactions of the CEZ actions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Borsa recovered from the hole of the day before it was almost 6%.
After this, there's the crown of the actions at Wall Street.
Thus, from us, there is a reaction from the market to the vote of the House of representatives in America, which has refused to support the plan for the stability of the local financial sector.
Action Crollo in Asia
Thursday, the actions of the Asian Bars have lived a dramatic crollo, even though the Indians have recently deleted a part of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng of Hong Kong's Bourse during the day has canceled almost 4%, but then a part of losses stabilised by 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises, following the movement of Chinese actions to Hong Kong, was decreased by 3.8% while the sea was closed in Shangai.
Actions at Sydney's Borsa were lost more than 5%, but at the end the losses were approved at 4,3%.
The Thay-Wan's Borsa, according to the local area, was decreased by 3.6%.
"The planning of salvation action is uncertain and this will influence the financial sea throughout the world," observed the head of the Value office of Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being a part of China, is only managed by the financial policy, so without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest tariffs at the same level of the United States.
The American legislators, according to the first Australian Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is the risk that other countries also reveal the consequences.
Travel of American Actions
The United States Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan, for which 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion Czech Crowns).
The legislators thus ignored the call of President Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would repeat the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole.
The American action on Monday has lived a street and the main index of the actions have registered the largest cross since more than a 20th.
The Dow Jones has fallen from almost 7% and a cross of similar dimensions has been observed lastly in 1987.
The vote was already down before the vote, but it was seen that the design of law was not approved, and it went into free fall.
The Congress has concluded: the US government can extend $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have been granted to a larger form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote will be at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators have cut down the box on the approval of the safeguard plan in the form of economic for the American financial system for a total of $700 million (approximately $12 billion).
But it's not saying yet.
The representatives of the Congress must therefore define some details of the mind before they publish the final form of the law and vote it.
The financial system's support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the Representative Chamber.
Thursday he said that to the Agency Re日s, the Chairman of the Committee for the Services and Financial Services of Barney Frank's room.
The Senate, according to some sources, could be voted on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economics, the announcement that will come to the approval of the financial plan should be the first and main psychological factor that can resurrect the financial sea.
However, it will be successfully returned to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, reaching the sea's age.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've made a big progress."
"We have cleared our various opinions on the form of the presentation of the package for market stability," Democracy Nancy Pelosi said to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to the same , the final vote could still occur on Sunday.
The delegates of the legislators gathered the night between the Sabbath and Sunday with the Ministry of American Finances Henry Paulson, to give the government funds definitively.
Funds should be used by financial companies to gain non-cedible hypotechary goods, which lead to serious losses and risk the stability of the whole system.
"We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and that it must also be effective on the market."
"There is still needed to bring the plan of repair, but I think we're here," Paulson said.
The Signal for the Asian Trade
The global financial crisis is strongly on the sea of actions that are brushing.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, legislators are so trying to reach a final agreement at the Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the trade in Asian financial sea, which are, in time, the first to influence the Monday market after the decision of the Congress.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two American Congress Chambers will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be arrested at the last time on some problems.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next days.
But the law will still make many changes.
The total amount for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But the Congress can block the rest of the sum in the case of the impression that the programme does not perform its function, blocking the following $100 billion and after the end of $350.
Bush appreciated the progress in negotiations.
Although the President can put the vice on this decision, the Congress can overflow its right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the programme has been maintained, it is important to get the funds to buy hypotechnical values, whose price is crossed because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not able to pay their hypotheches.
"We've made everything.
The room of representatives should be able to vote on Sunday law and the Senate Monday," as the Republican Senator mentioned.
The progress in negotiations is also satisfied by the American President Bush.
His portfolio Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied with the positive approach of Sabato and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial seas and protect our →".
Restriction of gold paracadutes
The Chairman of Senate Christopher Dodd, the main portfolio, said that the legislators agreed on the ability of the financial programme, the protection of contributors from losses, the closure of the budget of reductions, the interaction of the financial plan.
The new law must also restrict the so-determined gold parasites for the leaders of the agencies who participate in the programme and create a committee that will control the funds.
• The Ministry of Finance should be managed.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a big progress towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relates to the owners of the houses that have problems on payments.
The Government should negotiate the new rates of hypotheches that will purchase with the objective of reducing the monthly costs on debtor rates and allow him to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological support
The plan proposed is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea, but its performance will be very difficult.
"And because we don't know how and how the price will be purchased by the problem activity.
This will be determining how losses will be divided between them the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week for the site iHNed.cz .
If the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of the next week, it is not like Marek.
"Too much more important, it is that the representatives of the congress already this week have found an agreement on the support of this plan and that they will make it first possible.
The psychological meaning of this agreement that will be approved is at this point the most important time, "declared Marek.
Dual to last blood: MP3 readers against cellular
We will advise how to choose
While almost every cell can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this, it is clear that it's better to buy only the phone.
Yet, there are many reasons for seeking an autonomy reader.
The choice depends all of the way of use and requirements of the future owner.
Perhaps you might hardly buy a costly high quality giradian to listen to us the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
First of all, these musical products do not echo like LP and from the qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason.
However, if on your scaffals they're weakening hard-rock vinils, jazz or blues probably, a guitar of such as at least you're dreaming.
Similarly, it works with the portfolio music, such as compressed music or in MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
For some, it can be unacceptable to expenditure for a 80,000 coroner, as a fan of Pink Floyd may hardly divorce the coffee from 20 coroners of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
To decide is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than reading music, but they do not even make cellulars for mistakes.
There is no other apparatus as universal as the cellular.
Near primary functions, call and send sms, you can read music and videos, record both and have a photo machine, sometimes better times, and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we take into account the smartphones and the handhelds you will also have a computer in a miniature.
It's a small miracle because no frigorifer can do the grid and no television can photograph nothing.
The universality of the cells also brings disagreements.
More functions you are using on the cell and first the holder on it will require the load battery.
And reading music consumes much energy.
Some cellulars can read music for more than 12 hours, especially, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (in particular the most simple) are much more effective.
As regards economic cells, you do not count that they can dure for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, since when, some calls , look for work for security, this is also valuable for the most costous devices.
But you will not have this problem with a MP3 player even the worst duration at least 9 hours of functionality continue with a reload.
Another problem has occurred when music is downloaded in the cell.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of devices has the USB universal port and no more can all be connected to the computer without a special software.
Music can be registered directly on memory card, but only few memory readers are able to do it without adjuster for minicards that do not use in cells.
Readers,training some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music trace USB from the computer.
Most cells and readers are created from only a multimedia library according to the names of the interpreters, album names, generates, or according to the user's classification.
Some apparatus only regenerate the tree structure of the folders, like the Explorer tool in Windows, and some true do both things (ver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manage, cellulars can do more.
When you choose a special equipment, especially interest in the resistance of the batteries, memory ability, quality and type of audio output and clearly of the use facility.
If the music needs you especially from the background and if you listen to it every day only shortly on the tram, you just have a cellular any reading MP3.
This can be ormai, clearly to any cellular.
You don't have too much to care about what your cell or player formats are.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of music that comes to you will be just in this format.
Besides this format that belongs to the most exposed, the total majority of the devices supports music in WMA format.
The AAC is less (format used by Apple and its Ipod company).
Best cells also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit the corresponding pages of the operator (or another supplier) via the mobile Internet and buy the song or album.
This same service may already be a valid argument to buy a cell-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is harmful and, usually, is limited only to hit at the time of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But usually it is assumed that just this way of sale of music (which is through GSM, Internet or Internet) will in the future dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry the cell behind.
Whoever wants to listen to something fruit in the task while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on this, if you always carry out the coffee or at least the aircraft without boxes.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 players has.
Maybe the biggest benefit of cell-readers will be, for many, the price.
The most economy cost us usually less than 30,000 crowns.
For 3 and 40,000 crowns you will already buy a very dignity walkman.
Normally, but you will be limited by the unless a coffee income.
Best cells and from the most equipped technical viewpoint and also with 3.5 mm capture for common coffee, cost up to 150,000 coron.
Instead of the benefit of the readers, it is, above others, the easy manageability.
The most simple non-economic (see our choice) really makes it everyone to keep them on.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of managing a time with the common stereo or perhaps the giradica, is obviously.
There is no danger to urge wrongly the start of the mobile Internet network and therefore a gigant ballet for data transmission.
What equipment to take
Also the most economic cells (e.g. Vodafone 527) have usually a place for changed card memory (type M2, microSD etc.).
In addition to the acquisition of the respective card, it is 2 000 coroners.
But watch.
Basic models only support cards with the maximum 2GB.
Only those most precious are doing it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell and you want to buy you a little MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the ability (max. 2 GB) you do not have to expend more than 1 100 coron.
If you are part of the most required listeners, please take the specialized cells - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
Equipments have individual keys for MP3 and the quality of the service is so close to the same MP3 player.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more road, whose cells of the walkman line have the same use scale as MP3 readers sold separately.
MP3 readers of the above steps provide the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 coron, but with a greater memory capacity (to 16 GB) and the resistance of the batteries (commonly 15 hours, in line of maximum up to 35 hours).
The first operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Perhaps
Maybe the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, and our operators offer almost all services like their partners in Western Europe.
There, however, is missing something – an operator who obligations those to deliver the price to be lowered.
Maybe he'll not miss for a long time.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most dear ones in Europe, we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the accounts it also confirmed the CTU, which noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last issues of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming tariffs, may be a paradoxal situation - for some Czech Czech operators, SMS will cost less than home.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic remain so high towards Europe?
The answer is, the lack of competition that would really want to start the fight .
Perhaps it sounds surprising, even here we have three mobile networks and covering highly over 100%.
Instead of the operators of the mobile telephony, it likes to be disappointed by the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Council, Paul Dvořák, often stressed that in the past, there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It's probably true that the operator has no longer many possibilities. (The rest may be difficult to find other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility - the operator.
Just the income on the market of the operators has brought a significant reduction in prices, which would have to be responsible for traditional operators.
At the same time, before the income of squalies such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market, there were items similar to us in Britain.
However, it has been demonstrated that the place for operators of this kind is there and that they can have real success.
In the end of the accounts for examples, we must not go very far.
In February of this year, we informed you about the arrival of the Mobilking Operator in Poland.
In only a half year, this operator has been able to win more than 100 thousand clients and to become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group whose membership in the Czech Republic belongs between the other U:phone.
The benefit of the operators is the opportunity to focus on a much more concrete group.
To be able to work effectively, it's a lot of less clients than a translator.
They do not carry back, mean, high costs for creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world, the operators are usually present to lower costs, offer calls and SMS a little price, which is often balanced with the offer of the most rigorous services.
So, for example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS that cost the half of its competitors as a minimum.
But as shows the example of Mobilking in Poland, it may be a good enough move also the scom’s on a group-bersaglio not shortly.
This operator points to this specifically on men.
"The true men choose Mobiling Operator who loves and whose trust you can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this operator.
It is difficult to say if we can also say a similar concept as in Poland.
The print portfolio for Vodafone Miroslav Čepisk doubts: "The Czech market is small for a frammented approach, on which most of the operators are based on.
More than the view of services is saturated."
In Czech Republic there is no possibility, the operators of the mobile network say
But it seems almost sure that if there is ever a operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be the Mobilking.
"The extent of this success project is spoken, but negotiations in Czech Republic do not have a lot of expectations.
Mobilking's attachment will be greater in the other countries of our area," he said in a phone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studičková, the printing portfolio of the Penta financial group.
It thus confirmed indirectly that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very favourable to this thinking.
In contrast, they are trying to do everything because you don't create any potential competitor.
Since a few times, he does not hide his interest in the start of an operator, the GTS Novera group would like to do so another way to become a real competitor of Telephone O2 in the field of business clients.
"We have a great interest in offering not only fixed services to our customers but also mobile telecommunications.
And first it's better.
We have again negotiated this option with all the Czech operators of the mobile network.
We have already been able to progress in negotiations with some of them," says the Portfolio of the group of Paul Kaidl.
So maybe there will be better times.
Not official information indicates that the first operator may have to have it before the end of the year.
For now, however, it comes to its creation, and there's an inevitable silence wall.
"We now do not believe that there is the space for the creation of a full-title operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific, in contrast to other sea.
Even now, no subject with a complete and serious project has turned to us," men’s in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srszeň of the O2 print section.
In the specificity of the Czech market, the other operators also replaced.
The T-Mobil Martina Kemrová's print portfolio adds in a rare agreement with O2: "For now we have not noticed any vital and advantaged commercial project for both, on which you can continue to build."
And adds: "In the T-Mobil network, a operator will hardly appear until the end of the year.
At this point we had already had a concrete agreement on the table so that it could be considered horizontally."
Vodafone focuses its attention closely on the achievement of the own license requirements of 3G.
Adds Miroslav Čepisk : "We are open to the negotiations of potential operators, especially in the context of the division of expenditure and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of the customers, the most producer.
The main Vodafone strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
Competent authorities - with compulsory operators
The performance of mobile phone operators can be easily understood, the income of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to the reduction of prices and with this to the reduction of profits.
Why then facilitate the access of such a competitor?
The faults return to the creation of U:fon testify that when operators hold a true thing to replace from the same side.
Perhaps the big pressure pressed against the TTU during the U:phone creation period towards T-Mobile company.
This testifies public access information from the CTU web pages.
But now the U:phone needs an argument for which you do not accept the operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The environment of the competition of the mobile phone market has been lowly enhanced by the income of the fourth mobile operator in the market.
As regards the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the income of another competitor would be on him and, in particular, on his high-precious services."
Dell’s attitude to mobile phone operators is, however, extremely extremely disinterested by the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not only the attachment of the CTU that, despite the Czech Republic - to the difference in Great Britain and other developed countries - has no power to interfere with economic competition.
This belongs only to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position towards the whole problem.
"The income of the operator on the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of the non-infrastructure required between mobile operators and operators.
No such contract has been concluded until because the offer of potential obtainers was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," Christián Chalupa said, of the section for external relations UOHS, in the answer to our questionnaire.
A so-formed statement by the representatives of the operators may not occur.
Instead of the office to defend the interest of consumers and, above all, take care of the fact that no one benefits from his position on the market, it is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the outside where the operators are commonly working, we can notice that their income on the market has contributed to the reduction of prices for mobile phone services."
Of course, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the reduction of prices does not belong to UOHS interests.
Truly shocking in all the situation is the almost emotional harmonization of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really only a coincidence, it is one.
Similarly, the same gas price for all benzines is the fruit of the coincidence and competitive fight.
"The section has not found signs of anti-competitive behavior about this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so he does not have a corresponding more effectiveness for his behavior on the market.
The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile network market for operators may also miss the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many controverse points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant sea produced by the CTU, which means that telecommunications are from the view of economic competition the only market.
On a market of this kind, obviously, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some jury experts offer another approach - for the creation of a operator is always needed to have the agreement of the executive of the network.
And the mobile operator has logically accounts – the monopolie of his network.
So for a certain part, it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, UOHS should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators are so strangely similar.
At the same time, the claims of the interested parties (that is GTS Novera mentioned) show that during negotiations with all operators are very similar obstacles.
Downloading the facility in the telecommunications is a lot of frequency truck with which UOHS is out of all the facts.
This is what we already found in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been able to promote the extension of the rights of the CTU on the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the update of the Law on recently accepted telecommunications, despite the fact that many experts expected the improvement of the situation.
This is the fact that UOHS representatives must know it more than well, but their interests may be elsewhere.
You can do, when no one looks
While we do not see the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators, some of them are even in the Czech mobile networks.
It is an advantage that publishs their lists of prices of mobile phone services, but they are only partly public.
It is usually agencies that are occupied with multilevel marketing.
So, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a series of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually reaching only the benefitable people.
The magic is in fact that the company against the operator is a classic business client, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important client then receives special price offers (and another).
The problem is that the trade conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators are prohibiting such prevention.
"If the cases you're talking about, which we'll be interested, it could be a violation of contractual conditions, and it could focus on the conclusion of the cooperation with that company," he answered the question of Martina Kemrová.
But it is unlikely that such activity would not reach the ears of the subjects of mobile phone operators.
In particular, in the cases of 3 men's assets, you can be treated by thousands of customers.
No operators are at the same time from a kind of attitude.
From the activity of these agencies, a non-individual profit and at the same time - in the contrary to true operators - they are not harmful in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepisk warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, but only a transcurrent percentage of customers uses the services of these avenues.
They must also accept that the SIM card is not registered on their name, so they can't be able to provide full of it as the habitual customers of mobile phone operators "
But this should be a strange minimum for the CTU.
Moreover, there is another issue for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes before a kind of attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient powerful rights to dismiss similar activities and if he does not want to be obliged to explain the operators who do not have any idea of this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not more costuous
As the text has already been said many times, the income of mobile phone operators on the market has brought a significant reduction in prices for services.
At the same time, practically in all countries where the operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small market, too saturated, problems with quality of services.
But in developing countries, in these cases, regulatory bodies have been intervened not by mobile phone operators but by their customers.
Or with formal measures, either with non-formal pressure, then joined the creation of the first operator, and others joined him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies start from one to another the case as a painful patata.
For our experience, we cannot dismiss the feeling that the non-clairy of powers in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But we don't get the snake.
If the backscan information is right and the operator will really appear quickly from us, the Czech mobile phone market will be moved.
If one of the operators had permitted the creation of a mobile operator only difficultly UOHS could remain inappropriate to the derogation (displease) of the other interested.
And we may stop calling to higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Ino has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the yellow in Czech.
On Monday, first Mirek Topolánek at the occasion of the Czech State's Day of Resurrection presented the new records of the other in "Where my home".
The new registration of the other was made by the Orthodox of the Teatro, under the direction of Jiří Bölohłavek.
There are four available versions – asol with the masculine or female voice, coro and the instrumental edition.
The cant is under the direction of Katherine Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the other reviews are Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.ch site you can listen to all and four versions.
The whitehlavek considers the song in the Czech one of the most begli others.
He already said to the "Cheský rozhlas" radio that has chosen appropriately to sing the variants alone, the songs with the youngest voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to care that both and the core, have the clear word, that the text is well comprehensible, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the nineth in the next year will celebrate the 175^ anniversary.
The song "Where my house" was sounded for the first time in 1834 on the palco del Stavovskéh divadlo in the original Opera Fidlovačka de Joseph Kaietán Tyl accompanyed by the music of František Škroupa.
He purchased popularity and the people spontaneously made it.
The first stream of the song after the foundation of the Czechoslovakia in 1918 became the natural part of the inno na.
It remains one of the seven symbols in it even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How it sounds the "new" inner
Wednesday MHD of Prague will be with you for the first time with an electronic teasure
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it will be written in the history of Prague transports as the date in which the metro, tramway and bus will come up to the first passengers in the place of the paper billet.
Currently if you can find it about hundreds of people who possess their Opencard teas .
The passengers can buy that from 30 and 90 days and year (the first January 2009) and at the same time reload their letter in the Infopoints and in the offices of the Company dei Transporti and at the stopped of the metros Museum, Mostek, Nadraje Holešo, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajska garden, Kacherov and Luka.
The shoppings can already be purchased from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers have benefited from the service before the evening.
Those who will start using the service via the Internet can completely forget sports in the metro stops where they had to do long files for paper papers.
The shopping buys it via the Internet and on Opencard reloads it on one of the 12 branches of the municipal library.
"In these places, passengers have a personal sport that will provide the interested in the Internet acquis and will also register the acquisition on their paper." said the portfolio of the Martin Opatrny project.
Furthermore, in the libraries you will be able to load the electronic locks on Opencard in hot and evener which are installed at the metro inputs.
How are these homomates?
They are red, like the recorders of the billets, and the passengers have already observed them at the stops of the metro Roztyly, Bu月ovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska.
"Now there are five in the city, but until the end of the year they should be eight," Opatrny concluded.
The tissue will be controlled rather than by the autist from the homat.
The service that will work from tomorrow is much.
Just insert the Opencard threshold and before the shopping payment, it will be loaded up.
Electronic teases eat from tomorrow, not only in the capital but also around it.
That is in the towns of trains and bus from number 300 to 499, which the communities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In trains added to the integrated transports of Prague, there are collective readers controllers of cards with which they check the time and zone validity," he explained the method of control of Philip's billets from the Ropid Organization, which points out the hours of the collective transports of Prague.
The urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated in the box of the Âsta.
So the suit is needed not only to show the magnetic paper at the sta, but more needs to support Opencard at a specific point of appreciation for the box.
Thus, the raising checks the validity of the cariders.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the dear tissues, there is nothing more easier than to ask this type of information to it," Drápal added.
The passengers who take the urban buss and will not remember when the slider's validity is expired, may return to self-services where the slides are loaded on the paper.
There will be displayed information on the validity of their documents on the equipment.
The Swedish Germans wanted a reference from the United States
The Germans of Sudeti in 1945 asked to include Shumava in the United States.
This results from the letter deitéed in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the United States patronate.
With this desire, as it is said, some groups of Germans of the Sudeti returned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This results above all of the letters contained in a private and today-based literature in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Chesky Krumlov ask the American President to not allow again the refund of the "Shumava district" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of Monaco agreement – in the Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that the American units arise in the German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in the letter signed by the words "The people who have the destination of Shumava with the whole heart."
Because, they say, the attachment to the Czech Slovakia – knowing the character na Czech - gives the Germans hope only to the brutality, to the lack of regards, to the incomprehension, to the oppression and slave, the authors of the letter pray to the American president to keep the protector on Shumava now and forever.
"We can't believe that without regard to the opinion of a fourth million inhabitants, you would want this territory as a state for us foreigners, who oppresss and strikes the ethnic minorities and has not contributed for nothing, just for nothing, to the victory of the Alliance," it writes in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the fear of the seat of sale by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had to doubt the conviction of the Germans in Schumava , it would simply organize a referendum on the will of his inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the standards of the United States.
Although the text of the letter can seem to be aware of our knowledge of the history of after war, some witnesses describe appropriately the expectations of the Germans of the Sudeti.
Although the Germans had to imagine at least that it would be about their movement from the Republic, only a few of them accepted a likely opportunity.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would negotiate a kind of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudeti.
Others thought they would remain in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in Czeška Bu日.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Bouăo in the sea power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison field in Holsttýn, the tens of other German Germans went to find him so that he teached him the Czech.
"These believed that when the Czech returned home, the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
No of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovaquia pima of war believed that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes, they would be moved by the Republic.
You don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the autists
The most costible action in the Czech history of the road security.
This could also be defined by the emotional median campaign, which the Ministry of Transports has intended to leave Thursday.
Minister Aleš Rebiček's office is expected that this scores the leaders from a dangerous behavior to the flight.
The campaign of 150 million will appear in television, radio, cinema, Internet but also on volants.
The authists should be cut off from the quick guide and under the effect of alcohol to the flight.
And remember him too to put the cinture before he goes.
To touch them in consciousness, especially young autists,motocyclists, pedons, and not for recent professional leaders.
What's going to happen in the spot?
Especially the stories of people who will face emotions.
And that also testifies the "sanguinos" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "not think" is written on the targa.
And in a pocket of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can pay with his own life in a moment of employment.
The spots will "spaven" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglossason countries, where they usually can see images with drastic scenes of accident victims.
You're so promised to lower the number of accidents and dead on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carote and bastons and guides
"The carote and baston system works with the autists.
The bridge for them is, for example, when they passe with the red and thus spare their time.
The baston is the danger of the wound or incident.
It is necessary to remember the risk of guides, " says the psychology of the Ministry of Transports Martin Kořán of the Hospital Na Homolce.
So they want information campaigns in the printing, and especially negative publicity, believe psychology.
He states that the pains that warn the aids of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel has been installed to warn about the danger, he will probably soon be confused with the environment and the guides will not give him more attention," warned Korján.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territory in exchange of peace
The first of the Israelian Provisionary Government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the refund of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, Jerusalem east and the heights of Golan, instead of the peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So she said in the dialogue that she published Monday, Jediot Achronot.
"D we must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, that means that it will be necessary to return almost all areas (occupated), if not all of us, " said Olmert to the daily.
"We have a certain percentage of these territory, but we must leave the Palestinians the same percentage (of the Israelian areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any refund will also include Jerusalem east .
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want rushes or spiantrices to do it, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to refuse to one part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the accent to the two attacks of Luglio in the city, during which some people have been disappointed and tens of wounded people.
According to the first, you will need to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historical places", which are within the Old City. .
"He who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also underlined.
The removal from Golan's heights
Olmert also spoke about Israel's retirement from Golan's heights, which is, according to him, the improper condition to conclude this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require a certain effort from the part of the country.
"I don't propose the conclusion of the peace with Syria only on the basis of Golan's retirement," he warned.
"The Syrians are right to what they will have to refuse to get Golan's heights.
They will have to reject their relationship with Iran; they will have to reject their relationship with Hezbollah ( movement of the Sciites); they will have to refuse to permanent support, which offers the terrorism of Hamas, ( movement of Sciitis) of Al-Qaida (the terroristic network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the first.
Questions after the incident: Are stewards illegal in the bus?
The Law doesn't make them, it can't walk on the bus which is a long distance
In the context of the tragic incident, the Italian city of Padova del pullman of the Student Agency company came out the question whether stewards and passengers can move to the bus during the course.
"If we want to respect the laws seriously and formally, the activity of Steward is in conflict with the law of the road movement," says the Portfolio of the Ministry of Transports of Karel Hanzelka.
The incident of the last week with which a 22-year-old hostess has been caused by a truck that cut the road to pullman.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting at that moment at the lower safe place of the pullman, although there were still two other signed places.
But the bus can make an accident or breathe brushing even when the coffee or journal distribution is distributed.
It depends on whether the bus is given or less places in feet in accordance with the circulation book.
If the passengers are not authorised, they must be sitting.
Student Agency's buses have not been placed in feet, confirmed it at the current site.cz the director of the Radim Jančura Dictionary.
"We have evaluated this with the Minister and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we have concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the course if they have the place signed," he expressed his viewpoint.
The law doesn't hold the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of Steward – no law is involved in the regulation of this role."
However, no regulation prohibited the transporter to carry out services.
The road circulation law is only the companion term of the vehicle, its rights and debts are not defined," adds less clearly Hanzelka portfolio.
The Director of the Department of Road Road Road Rurality of the Ministry of Transports of Joseph Pokorny considers that the law cares enough for this issue.
It depends on whether the bus has the places in approved feet.
Everything here," he says.
Category the buss in towns where there are feet and maximum speed places, interurbanes with feet places with higher and longer higher speed treatment without feet places with the maximum speed for and seats of security circles.
Like in the air, he says the expert.
The BESIP expert on Straight Safety Jaroslav Horén does not find the background problem in the movement of stewards on the bus.
"In a quiet course there are no so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the air service.
Not even there is safe when a turbulence comes and the flight assistant can broke the test."
"If the bus makes a frenade brush, obviously eat the physics laws.
Like in the city pullman or on the tram.
The carrier must repeat the safety of stewards with a internal regulation," he also intends that, from the view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only direct transport that provides the services of the Stewards.
This uses about two hundred.
Even after the incident, the director considers their dangerous employees.
"I won't have the feeling of having to consider the profession of Steward as a dangerous work, I'll abbolize it.
The passengers can receive coffee and journals while they go.
They would also decrease the costs," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a line fraction in respect of Student Agency, motivated the lack of stewards on its means as an interest in security.
"We have no hostess, we're already opposed to the beginning.
First or then he will end with an accident of death," he said less than a year ago Tiden.cz.
It has been a huge tragedy.
In the case of the line for Napoli, a young hostess in the Plzeň region was deceived, which had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck probably went out of the emergency course without using the arrow and locked the road to pullman.
The pullman's leader tried to avoid it with a brushed hand, but he hit it with the right front.
Jančura refuses the fact that the two places reserved to the rest of the Stewart were occupied.
"You can't keep these places in the long-treatment pullman, they're inevitable."
The dictate is in mind to denunciate the autist of the truck.
The Agency will not expect the Court's judgment to pay the damage to the girl's family, but it is expected to be a financial holder.
The revision of the law?
Not invisible
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts of the Ministry of Transports for more than one year works, could lead to clarify the movement of Stewarts on bus.
"They have not reached any concrete results, however.
The pullmans do not consider them so much, they are busy more than the pointing system, the maximum speed on the autostray and the use of the cell during the lead," says the expert Horien.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of Stewart as a great threat to the safety of passengers," concludes Havelka portfolio, that the control of bus security is the competence of police and security offices.
Düsseldorf’s hopes point on Francofort
The words are not missing in the letter of the WestLB Director in which the householders have been addressed.
In the letter published on Monday that could be "the centre of the capital market of the financial group of reserve cases" through the meeting of the Düsseldorf Institute unit with the Deka-Bank of Francofort.
West LB would launch "a competent block" with hard profits in such a company.
In addition, all such Unions may be a decisive challenge for further links in the country banks sector.
This is read, when a administrative advice in difficult times wants to demonstrate the actionability.
Because the WestLB affliction is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the EU committee but also through the Entity for Financial Monitoring Service, noteing the regional government of the North Renania - Western that the time is to find a future solution.
The links between the Deka-Bank, which the same clients of the Risparmio Case already know because of their investment funds, and WestLB certainly has already been talking about it for a while, even from Francofort.
The Deka-Bank Franz Waas, finally, refers to the Deka-Bank Franz Waas head at the presentation of the first half of the year that a house's fusion near Magonza with a naʹa like the Helaba or West LB doesn't mean.
However, the Deka Administrative Board, which by half is brought by the regional banks and the consortians of the reserve cases, delegated the Administrative Board to conduct along with West LB on common contracts.
It could be the market negotiations or parts of them.
However, the conversations have, as they say in business, started.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 persons, is one of the more accounting businesses in Francofort, which is not the first time when it is to consolidate the security case sector.
In 2003, it seemed that Deka-Bank could be based on the regional holding of the Renania-Palatinato and Helaba.
This association with three did not do anything.
Once the projects were published, the region of Asia was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two sites have also been unable to reach an agreement.
Instead, the region of the Renania-Palatinato went to the region of the Baden-Württemberg in Stoccarda.
And they have always thought about us for a Fusion of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end of Günther Merl , president of the Helaba Director Council, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
In addition, this seems to be created by cognition, that it is necessary to draw close to the various houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Landesbank could be held with the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, it's not a good news.
If the pressure increases for other fusions, the partners will miss their hands.
In the South now there would be the young partner, although he has already overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Monaco and Stoccarda.
The association of the reserve cases of Asia-Turingia participating with 85 percent of Helaba has placed the catenacity at the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NordLB would remain.
Geo-strategic reasons are only one account.
On the other hand, there is also the issue of how the various business models of the single homes are to be involved.
In the month of Merl noted that at the decision-making question, with which the future of the regional banks would be assured, there would not yet be an answer from the association of German reserve cases.
Finally, the division of West LB could also come out, which is naturally not desired by that.
Thus, the letter of the Administration Council expresses the will of attracting in any case to a "general resolution".
You will see how the collection of individual parties will work with Deka-Bank.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to the Italians
For Elena is the first time for Luca is the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present to the festival as a companion, and so he says that everything is different.
After them, Kaiser's bathroom of the 5l mark is in the feet of a barboot mass and shows about 200 travelers who are the deep tons that can produce from the goal.
Elena before Luca was a package and after a bathroom.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here at the parking of buss at the Porta New station, they leave this evening at 23,45 four roads with destination Monaco, Festa de Birra" , I arrive for 6.30 hours.
Three currencies are reserved in particular to the Italian, in one other traveling only Brazilians.
In a parking angle, the South Americans are sing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so sound, says Marco, that it's not something for the Italians.
Mark that carries a long cappotte with powder and a couple of eyes with silent width steaks belong to the buss.
Since 5 years they've gone to Octoberfest, this year's three tours.
The night-and-day-to-feeding hangs back at 22,30.
It would only create unusual expenditure, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the travel, the welcome of the brindis with the beer Kaiser, made in accordance with the standards of Bavarian reality, the box of disease and the German guide – Marko has attended a German course in Francofort.
And so night's buses gone around the Brander.
There's no beer yet.
I think the silence falls in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better, they will still need their forces.
They are standing in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian buses on the A9 Street before Monaco make a short pause.
When the group of Marco arrives at 6,30 at the parking in Theresienwiese, there are some 50 buses from all Europe.
Elena, Luca and others are grouping, Marco explains the attack programme for the last time.
First: put the yellow cap.
On this on the left, "Oktoberfest" has been written in "Oktoberfest" with the Internet enterprise of the Marco Travel Agency: "Knowersining.it".
Second, "When they open the doors of the bird's tent means run!", Mark quotes the first morning.
"Return!" Ride and occupy the places under the tent.
"Not forward, he sent us lock, and not all the yellow yellows sitting on the same panels, dividing into the attached space!"
The mouth covers 8.25 Euro, Urla Marco.
And don't forget of giving the lack.
"Show to the security service, that we do well!
When you leave the places, they disappear!"
Third, "Tonight at 22,30 points, we're meet again here!
It's already going for the party.
On the road, one attacks as follows the yellow bears on the trees, the road cards and even a brochure map of a large popular game of bavarians.
You want to be ready to make the retraction.
It's the second weekend of the festival, known as "the end of the Italian week".
The exact data does not exist, it is about 50 miles, which go through the Alpes and invade the tensions, it is understood that 10% of visitors will be accompanied by Italy.
Monaco's police is strengthened with 7 agents of the High Adige, Italian volunteers support the red bavarian cross, which makes statistics on nativeness, where the Italians come to the first place with 200 medical cures before the English (approximately 60 medical cures) and the Austrian (approximately 80).
In particular, the Italian loved is the tent of Hofbräuhaus.
1. Dark nights for the Believes of the Real Estate
The German system is stable, confirmed the Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the political has used the word "relative" and has also stressed that the German sector does not have the critical developments.
Because the crisis has started the end of the week.
The real estate financer Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, receives a billion credit from a German bank consortium in order to protect the turbulences on the sea.
A expert person of the situation said to the King Monday, the support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate must only pay interests for the requested party.
The money comes from private banks and from public banks.
In the bottom, the loss of Depfa's office is lost.
The State financer, according to a newspaper article, has refinanced in a short term – which is not more possible because of the deficiency on the sea.
In the first half of 2008, the reserves of the euro were reduced by 95% to 2,37 million euros, and the capital share was also decreased from 1,6 to 1,45.
The current income and net income from financial affairs were fallen at 0 in comparison to the last year, the increase in applications and certain actions relating to the liquidation of credit accommodations have increased more than 70% of EUR over 5 million.
Only because of higher income from the subordinated compensation refund which comes from the restructuring of the ex-group Depfa and from the refund of interests in accordance with the single text of the tax laws and the management of businesses for immobilious consortiums, the negative profit has been sufficiently moderate with about 16%.
The former public financer after being privatized in 1990 was held in the speculation with commercial immobiliary credits, which were scorpored in the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of common projects of private and state investors (PPP) and was internationally diversified.
The Hypo Real Estate now needs to murder the value of the officer, which will have material effect on the benefits and loss of the group.
The fact is that the dividends have been deleted.
In 2007, 2/3 were already reduced.
The Hypo Real Estate after Depfa's absorption is an important financer of the State and infrastructure.
It is more than refinancing on the market between banks in comparison with other situations, because it does not have customers' confidence.
Because of the United States Investment Property Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the grant of credits between banks in great part has been disabled because the banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually needs a part of the Depfa credit portfolio – approximately 50 billion – short-term refinancing means.
According to Hypo Real State, the financial child of the group was covered by the credit for a certain period and the undertaking protected by the influence of the internal sea for the most unfunctioning.
From other sources it feels that the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Georg Fune Committee said, in contrast, that the HRE group will not need short-term sea.
The Bundesbank and the Ente na≤ for the financial supervisory service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the tradeability of the HRE group is still insurance.
This is expected for the adadears and the believers of the Area.
In view of the dynamic and insignificantness of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The financing may not be completely used.
But even the opposite is not to exclude.
After Sunday night, as long as it learned it was to fail, the momentan salvation couldn't calm the souls.
IS 75% of EUR 3.30.
They regain the courses of the mutuals enough.
While the previous debts are almost unemployable, they cedone the courses of posterated credits.
It is especially the mutues of the Württemberg-Hypo officers, comprehensively the decurses with expiry over 2009.
Before the Della HRE mutues looked like an alternative investment, their validity must now, after strengthening the banks' crisis and the institution itself, which with Depfa's significance the crisis, be considered to be aware of the stability of the internal financial system.
Unless the central banks, governments and less damaged banks are still ready, it can be counted on an annual deterioration within the term.
Or it comes to function, what no one can hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
However, on the information reported due to partial statistics, the probability of almost certain has become a justified hope.
It will, in particular, create long-term investors some nights insomnia with the decision if they share their commitments.
The short-term investors may conclude the report of losses for the future payments of the compensation rate on multivalences.
Sylvana and the Bento-Box secrets
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of the school should be presented to Tachibana Highschool, girls begin to ride: Germany is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new exchange log of Japan.
The first school day in Japan
Like I was emotional.
I had a fifth to go to school.
I live at Tokio margins to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes with the train to reach Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find her alone, and for fortunately, I didn't lose it.
The beginning of the first lection time does not seem to be fixed as we are in the low Sassonia.
Schoolers come to plan from 8 to 8 until at 8.40 a short career starts with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the lection started, it touched me.
However, I'm not the guy who speaks willingly before people, in addition to a class of 40 schools.
Since I had no school uniform yet, I'm an old guest mother's village, together with a shot, blue calcetons and black skin scarpe.
So I put my clothes in front of the catedra and tried to say good, "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- I'm called Sylvana, I'm coming from Germany and a party in a week my full-year.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have bibbited, lodged and made a sign, and then I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I've already known her from my Mangas.
It belongs to the key lessics of Japanese girls to surrender and means "carin, sweet".
Then I went quickly to my place.
The girl who loved me hurt, for her was a honour to sit at a exchange school.
The rest of the lection time was still quiet, but when he sounded the gong, I was stuck in the true sense of the word.
Everything talked disordinately and ridiculed and seized me with questions – then it is really difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the pause, everyone opened their Bento.
My guest mother also made me the balloon for the Lunch- it's different from the German bridges.
I had sown with species, salts, insults of cetriol and alge, fruit and a species of involtion with meat and tofu.
I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
The things seem strange and have a completely new saor.
It's done, it's all really good.
Maybe other than the bridges put under salt, brerr!
The Bento is not just the dinner at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Bent made from you, prepared enough artistically, with the hope to make the boy know during the recreation.
I read it in my fumes of Manga.
I'm really interesting if you can find out.
"Why exactly the Japan?" My friends asked me when I met, that I would like to go for a year to school in Japan.
I always said,
"Why I'm stuck."
Finally, I've been reading for years with fervors of Mangas.
And to understand better the fumes and culture they contain, first or later I started learning Japanese.
I was fully convinced to come once.
I'm also fascinated with tradition, use and costs.
There's a lot of here.
On one hand, Japan is a place of technologies and recent trends - from the opposite side: hard, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never heard lost, even though Tokio is the greatest city that I have never seen in my life."
1. The rats also have feelings
A rat or a scarfage runs away when they feel the danger.
The scientist Joseph Le Doux has convinced that: even many animals have feelings.
4. But how can you be sure if, when they behave in our own way, they have the same feelings?
The Internet "E" newspaper has been published a few years ago from scientists.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series has selected answers to the question: "What thinks it is true, without trying it?"
I think animals have feelings or other states of conscience, without that I or anyone else has been able to prove it, because we cannot even prove that other men have the conscience.
But in this case, we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. Once we refer to other species and ask questions about the feeling or generally the conscience, we enter into an increasing territory, because the reference base does not combine.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same thing that the other animals do. That makes it just to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
People behave in the same way, from where some scientists realize that there is a similar subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make us difficult to transmit our feelings to animals.
From one side, the prefrontal cortex is often connected to human consciousness, associated circuits (this for its direct access to short memory and to executive and control functions).
In the man this large area is much more developed than in the other primates and it seems that it misses completely between the other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our conscience of you from the prefrontal court, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, it is so accepted the responsibility on the assumption that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic specificity should be presented in the manner of speaking of man: since a large part of life is linked to the language, it is often said that it is linked to conscience.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the conscience of the animal, as it is done, is certainly very different from the circumstances of our conscience.
Therefore, it is difficult to discover how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If you can't measure it as an internal and subjective thing, analysing it through your experience due to the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most of the interpretations refer to the content of the scientist experience, but in addition this is another aspect of the conscience to which science would be easier to have access.
The processes of the consciousness of animals could be analysed without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short memory of the primates, especially in the example of the visualisation.
Thus, for this principle, Christof Koch and Francis Crick follows, the neural Correlates of the consciousness that cause mechanisms: both could be the same but not necessarily.
In interesting way, this principle also shows the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the visualisation.
What, then, is involved in feelings?
I imply them to the fact that a emo system as the fear is active in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
So what we indicate as "fear" is the mental state in which we find when the activity of the system of Property is located in the brain (or of its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the work memory.
You see that feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates, and especially human being.
With the speeching nature, we are creating subtle disturbances of feeling, because we can distinguish and category the works, to describe it to others.
In respect of this Antonio ́io, for example, thinks that feelings result from the primary activities of the regions of the body of the sensations of the cortex and the headpale, like Jack Pankseep, which has yet been more focused on the paleocephale.
Since this network during human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings that have been extended to the species .
At the pure theory level, I can't oppose it, but I think it is unexpected.
Pankseep brings arguments about the fact that what for rats and human beings appears as fearful, you probably warn yourself so with senses in both cases: but how can you happen if rats and humans prove the same thing when they behave in the same way?
A scarfing in the case of danger escapes as if he felt the fear?
In my eyes, the likeness of behavior can not yet show any vital similarity.
And the neural comparison continues to be of a·a: rats and human beings have similar paleosensphales, the scarfages are not even a brain.
But is the paleosensphalo for feelings?
And when you could even prove it for human beings: how would you like to show it on rats?
I think the rats and other mammifers, maybe even the insects (who knows) have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are actually different from us (when human conscience is based on specific circuits and languages), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there are neural progress here, in agreement with the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don't do research on language and conscience in rats, so I don't do it about their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This can be considered myope, but I prefer to do things forward, rather than continually swallow against a wall.
I'm a practical emo.
The President of the EUFA Platini: award for Poland and Ukraine
The first Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direction of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government views Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said
"This, however, is not an amnisty for our country.
The work has been started and there is still much to do in both countries."
Both home dominant countries are located in the marketing table for the construction or rebuilding of stages, streets, hotels and ports.
In fact, the number of stages to reach the Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't make more time.
Now we need to work with the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Association Grigorij Surkis.
"The EUFA will keep on looking for us"
A more radical eye has been made in Poland.
After many scandals, the direction of the Poland Association PZPN has been suspended by the Empire Committee on and with the indigenous administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee has been gathered on request by Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It would be "the serious danger that the PZPN is not to operate in accordance with the rules," Drzewicki said to the Poland Information Agency.
"In a letter we assured the President of the EUFA Michel Platini that preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer."
Numerous exposers of the first division only at the last season were condemned for manipulation, and at the end it had to send the beginning of the Law to the last time.
Dennis Quaid Ripped indignated
He wanted to promote a new movie, in interview he talked about the privacy, and now he's born with the ex: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star declared adulter his ex Dennis Quaid.
He's wounding and riding.
War of Roses at the ex-married Meg Ryan and Dennis Quad: Seven years after their separation, both actors in Hollywood now dispute with one another with a bad litigation - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time, he expressed the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis has been my long infidel, and this has been very painful."
You would have come to know it only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "speaking of the soul" was the work with Ryan's printing for his new film "The Women" – the story of a adultery.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to her publicly declared adult husband was clearly distorted: "It would be "inaudit," said the fifty-fourth in the "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the next time repeat and rebuild the story of our report."
It would also be "depleasant" that in Jack, the seventh child they had together, again "the pain and survival are publicly remembered, which a separate means for each child."
While Ryan lives from the separation from alone, Quad is married again and will shortly become father of日.
And therefore his judges shut up with the arrow: "My life goes in any case.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Cost prices for air and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and awards in Europe were more economic than the year.
In Germany, according to a study, the flights would be even 50% more economic.
Flights and pernotes in the hotel have become more convenient - this is the result of a study of the financial supplier and American Express travel.
The company analyzed its data about the reservations of the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first trimester, the second trimester observed an evidence of the prices.
After the prices in the hotel market have increased for years, the quotations in many places have already been priced.
Since January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities are still examined in average of 6,9 in comparison to 2007.
However, from April to April, the prices had already been over 3,6 % lower than the year.
The most evident trend would be in Paris and in Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year ago.
The American Express looks as a reason for this weak quotation of the dollar, which would lead to a "cool desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Francofort and London would also be touched by the reception of the hotel prices in a stronger way than the industrial centres such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices with a increase of 26.3% are also increasing in Europe.
In the case of flight prices, the tendence in the first trimester is still indicated on:
Because of the cherosin recovery, the Economy Class passengers had to pay in average 7,1% compared to 2007, long intensive fuel flights would be to 29,2% lovers.
Since April to April, the prices of the Economy Class's air billets have been lost in average of 12,5 % compared to the trimestre, in the first class and in Business, however, the price changes have been greater deaf.
In Germany, prices are still stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March, the prices were on 11,9 %, and in the second quarter, 23,6 % were decreased.
As regards the German internal flights according to the study, the prices were even half.
The reason for price crossing would be the economic growth in the above part, explained by the company.
The request in many segments of the air travel market has been scratched.
On the other hand, it would be through the Open Heaven Agreement, which liberalises the air traffic between Usa and Europe, a increased competition pressure.
A sign of the critical situation would be the depreciation of non-recommended contracts at Airlines, as well as the high number of air companys that in the first half of 2008 would declare failure – only in Europe it was 24 air companies.
HSV holds the Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV of Amsterdam becomes capolist.
Al Borussia Luhukay can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Christoffer Klein is worse in the landing of happiness for the narrator Marko Marin .
The Gladbach's holder first entered later in· and failed with a train on the cross
His message was formulated accurately, he passed on his lips in a convinced way.
He knew he was absolutely right.

"Now this wasn't all nice to see," he admitted later Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt would also "will be more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero, those in Amsterdam must thank the testing of Mladen Pet日 (11) and the fact that many Gladbach debtors had not been able to do bad to Hamburg debolitors.
"It was a snare victory," he repeated Martin Jol.
The SV of Amsterdam this Monday will be 121 years.
The spectators have already celebrated before, on Saturday afternoon, if themselves, the blue sky on the area and the lamping class on the video screen, which has legitimated their sports society as before the class.
It's gonna be a full-year without a real party.
"We're able to make everything right," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the presentation that the table-provider certificate is more indicated than the in-previsibility of the campaign than the domination of its HSV.
The square with its new arrivals later – the Neves and Silva Brazilians, the defensor of the Port Pet; as Jansen sophisticated to the FC Bayern – finds quietly itself, but it is not yet able to handle.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," returns Jol with strength.

The dark material influences the flight of space sounds
Since years a mystery phenomenon creates perplexity among scientists: Dark material influences the speed of space songs during the soded Swing-by man.
Experts fear that the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einsteins may be not exactly.
The spatial sondae Ulysses has flyed through the space for almost 18 years.
Because of fuel tubs that quickly congel the death for congelation is now on you.
A mysterious phenomenon of the scientists since years creates disappointment – the anomalia of the/or Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight manager of space sounds, with which they get additional slank/spint/scilling in the grave field of a heavenly body, for example of the Earth.
So suns can save very burning.
The Euro-American research sondae Cassini-Huygens has used this physical exhibition as well as the Ulysses sun sun.
What surprises students since years: the races do not behave in all the way we would expect according to the gravity law.
You're also reaching irregularities in the speed.
Sounds become faster or lately.
Until the physicals could not explain this effect.
In the year, the Swing-by's anamalium.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativeity, which describes the force of attraction of the material with a curvature of the space, may not be exactly.
The American Physician Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton believes firmly as before Einstein did not wrong, and try to explain the analysia of the Swing-by through the so deep dark material that the astronomys have warned in the cosmo.
"The responsible for anamalia may be the dark material that could also be very much on Earth," writes.
From the existence of the dark material, space students have only been familiar with about 10 years.
It is obviously a force of attraction from her, whose effect on other heavenly bodies is seen.
Instead of all invisible, it is not to send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of sort, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark material has at least a good fifth of the whole mass of the cosm.
The tourists captured in Egypt are free
After 10 days in their followers' hands, the tourists captured in Egypt would be free again, as the Italian Minister confirmed.
The repairs from Sudan had requested several millions of euros.
In a shot before 6 sequestrators have been released.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were captured.
The redemption treaties are already in progress.
The Germans are always in the mirror of the sequestrators.
WE ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists captured in Sahara are absolutely free.
This has agreed with the Egyptian state television, the Arab Arabic issuer Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
The Minister for Foreign France Frattini confirmed the release after the record of the Italian TV issuer Sky TG 24: "Our companions and others have been released.
We are looking for their health status," said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Roman as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, he refers to the Egyptian state TV.
The 19 components of a sending in the wilderness are already on the road for the Cairo.
The backscale of a shot that occurred before the release of the interruptions is not yet clear: so the repairs after the indication of an Egyptian public security agent would be ready for the conclusion of the rape, before the Sudanese exercise killed at surprise 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed for a ransom," said the officer.
It would be "only tried to take the offspring" when immediately "This surprise".
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between the Sudan, the Ciad and the Egyptian had taken up with fire 6 of the rapitors and captured 2 of them.
The sequencers had provided from Germany a remuneration of EUR 6 million; the money should be given by the German wife of one of the injuries.
The journal "El Masri El Jom" refers to a German mediator, the freedom of obstacles would be lost because the repairs were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the sequencers wanted to free the women in stock after the exemption of the salary.
The men would have to stay holding until the rapitors had no safe way of escape.
The German ambassador to Cairo has rejected a position on the report .
The abuses of the patriarch "bought to self-sufficiency"
Years of abuse from the patriarch have brought a woman to kill himself, he declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians, Cornovaglia, was in prison for 6 years after accepting eight cases of aggression.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly hurt his daughter Stephanie Randle when she had five to seven years.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession, "I feel for his death."
The Court learned that Mrs. Randle was in her house at Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at 34 years of age.
When she was a kid and lived in Coventry, Trerise hurt her and blessed her before she had his relationships, while the mother was out to work in a pub.
Threrise and his wife divorced in the Eighty Years, and he returned to live in Cornovaglia.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a voluntary to the National Trust, was tortured by the abuse they had caused her.
In 2006, the Public Ministry Ramsey Quaife said to the court that Mrs. Randle's friends, who was a greater surfist and cyclist, was "emotionally dead", and he had "molated with life".
In April 2007, her true father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
You think you've been usually suffocating with a plastic boss.
Mr. Randle comforted the father of his daughter, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "The law and I blessed her."
"I didn't hurt her in the middle of her.
I feel it for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise, "You are an extremely strange feticist, and for her victim she must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This wonderful saga ends with the victim that takes life.
More hard is the fact that if he did not, it would be difficult that the facts were completed before the court."
I note the effects that Stephanie's father and mother described their daughter in these years.
Otherwise, it was clearly likely that she was a promised and happy young man of success.
The officer who has the data will be punished.
The officer of the Cabinet Office who left the top secret documents on a train must be held by the Official Secrets Act, has learned the BBC.
The man was transferred by the Defence Minister when he left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to BBC before they were assigned to the police.
It is the less delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intention.
The corresponding member of BBC Frank Gardner said that the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They'd thought that this was treated inside the Mode and Office," he said.
The employee, which cannot be nominated, is to be made under section 8.1 of the act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer should be held by metropolitan police because of the nature of his work.
The documents that lost contained evaluations on Al-Qaeda and the safety forces of Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and brought to a hidden place.
Building companies face the B&B account
The English building companies could face a account of more than 80 thousand £ after the storage of Bradford & Bingley.
The Government has given 14 billion sterlines to protect the 2.5 million reserves of Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all agencies who take the money of the reserves, including the 59 building companies.
The Director-General of Building Societies (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of 14 billion sterline will eventually be paid when Bradford & Bingley's mutuals will be redeemed.
But the interest that will be taken in the meantime will be paid every year to 700 financial companies that take dei, but the interest that will take in the meantime will be debited each year at 700 financial companies that accept dei.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed BBC that 59 building companies would be included in that number.
It's irritant that those instructions that have been conducted in a manner are now called to pay part of the account of those instructions that have been very less.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deties he had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Tesoro estimates that the interest in the loan will be 450 million sterlines in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million sterlines to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of Construction Society Association, said to BBC that he believes that it is wrong.
"It is irritant that those instructions that have been conducted in the market in the reimbursement of the houses are now called to pay part of the account of those instructions that have been very less decent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We should examine all aspects in the next weeks to see what options there are to protect building companies and their members from what might be a significant account," added Mr. Cole.
The interest in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest of a whole year will be required and this may be almost two times higher.
Since building companies are mutuous organizations without assets, their members are finished to pay the account through higher tariffs or lower interest rates on reserve accounts.
The milk is 5 penny at litre
People in Jersey are faced with the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in prices in the mixture of his milk for a addition of five penny litres from Monday.
It is the second increase of the price this year, after a increase of two penny in February, and it comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Detailed sellers must decide whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increasing February, the price to greenhouse changed for the last time in 2002.
Reject the care of the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court of Bangladesh refused a request for care of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you could be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyers said that the Court refused to give you a caution for exorting 50 million tax (729.700 dollars) to a businessman when he was a member of the Parliament.
The case is one of the many consequences of corruption that are against you.
The political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, has been released for care at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next weeks but its party, Awami League, asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military days before the total freedom.
The correspondents say that while you were going to the outside for medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of its release, if you can stay free when return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that it will be called to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has refused the request for care for Sheikh Hasina by adding that she can't have the care because she's already at the outside on the word for medical care," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present a call against the Order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs care to return to the country from the outside to prepare the elections in December.
He expected the return to Sheikh Hasina after October 17, he said a senior leader of the Awami League party on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the military forced government took power, but she was released in ́ to go outside to receive medical care.
Sia Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all accusations against themselves.
Fear for the Anti-Poly Afghanistan campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunisation campaign because of violence associated with the Talban, says the United Nations.
The United Nations has introduced a programme of vaccination in six provinces last week.
But it is said that you cannot reach children in Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A United Nations portfolio said that this happens despite the promises of the Talbans that would not attack or prevent thousands of staff transporting vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal chain with ITV
BSkyB has its legal appeal with the decision of the Competition Commission to comply with the company to reduce its participation in the ITV TV station.
A BSkyB was told by the Court of Appeal of the Competition to break its actions in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the committee said that the participation of BSkyB prevented competition and allowed an injust influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the BSkyB participation to ITV seed doubts about ITV India, making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
The chief of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the groups of consumers and of Ofcom's regulator opposition to the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that forced it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation on the case of the United States procuror
The American General Prosecutor appointed a special Public Ministry to examine the licence of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the General Inspector of the Department of Justice criticizes the actions of the administrative offices.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and the former prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was made to be scattered from the fear that the applicants were removed for political reasons.
The Public Ministry of Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the investigated officers have lied to the investigators in trying to prevent justice.
"Series accused of potentially criminal behavior have not been completely investigated or appreciated," said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special minister with the power of providing witnesses to witness was one of the main recommendations.
The debate began when nine American prosecutors were removed from their positions from the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said the lawyers were released for expiry performance.
But later it concluded that the licensed lawyers were not more evaluated than many other colleagues, bringing many observers to conclude that the licence was motivated by the policy.
Some of the prosecutors were involved in the judicial action against republic members of the High Profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the fraud offence to the damage of democratic electors.
The American prosecutors are investigating and carrying out cases in court account of the government.
They can be released at any time, but they cannot be released for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, the general prosecutor Alberto Gonzales, was at that time in the storm for licensing, and finally remarked his position.
A number of other officers of the Department of Justice was released.
(The report of the General Inspector was very critical about Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that it was a primary ability in licences, which he had rejected its role of leader and was extremely dismissed during the process.
Other officers, including Bush Karl Rove's senior assistant, were criticized because they did not have investigations.
The episode of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock Star Meat Loaf is to be honoured to Q Awards for its inno epico Bat Out of Hell.
The song, who will repeat his special gold premium at the ceremonie of the next week in London, said that he was "honored" to win the ability.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the track of the hit album of Meat Loaf in 1977.
Coldplay will carry out nominations for the premises of this year, in the list of nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, chapter of the Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that pass things like time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell is no doubt one of them."
The song, composed of Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by Meat Loaf.
He opened it with an instrumental section that was about two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the fifteenth place.
But the Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell album remained nearly nine years in class and air sold more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for a cardiovascular irregularity in 2003 after he was arrested on the cup.
In 2007, acute layouts laid down the concerts to cancel.
Later he had a ciste on a voice cover.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and maybe soon in sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, bulevards, streets, and other cross-borders, some of them, other only useful.
But also many veteran taxists and residents a long time have been difficult to give the position of the Extra Place, for more than because they have never heard it speaking.
The small road is in East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 foots of width and 120 length, it is more like a powder wheel than an active-training way.
There are no travel signals.
It is usually impossible to see it on a normal atlant.
The road, however, must have .. .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the immobiliar company of recently built lusso buildings on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner facility for negotiations and bottles that should be opened in the new buildings.
Other ambassadors include neighbors long-term who say that they have been acquired from the road troapatedly because it was one of the last residues of the past.
But the department of the city's preservation and development, which has the control of the roads, doesn't care to keep it.
A meeting of the Committee for the use of the area of the Community Committee of the Circular, some representatives of the city's agency and Avalon Bay have denied a proposal for the immobilious company to buy roads.
But the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and asked a new plan to present the next month, says Susan Stetzer, director of the Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left to the town's property, and we want the city to continue to possess Extra Place," he said.
"There may be the proposals to system it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that he wanted to reopen the small road and install places to sit, including some to use for a café where the real estate company expects to acquire the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at the meeting of this month.
Michele de Milly, a portfolio of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that she wants to have it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this disfellowshipped vicle and transform it into a public amenity," he added that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a preservation portfolio, said that it was in fact the desire of the city to sell the road and noted that the purpose of the agency was to develop the property much than to administrate it.
In contrast to his most colored ability, Bowery, Extra Place left a historical printing.
Some believe that they took the name in 1802, when a large agricultural company possessed by Philip Minthorne was divided between his many children and the stretch of the earth was not recalled.
The back door of CBGB, the penk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street may be better known as the set for the photograph of the "Rocket to Russia" album.
"The land was great," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who made the photo in November 1976.
"It was uncleanness, clothes and pieces of bottles, poster, sheets, rams."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "generification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling extra Place, admitting that the part of public property, modesty, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rare – a city frame almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The book of claims: A little nostalgic view of the city in the way of extinction"), published part of a Discurse of the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a living angle without output, also cooks of day and delimited doors of arruginated iron storages and windows with sarakines, with old weekly newspapers that slow down the lows."
With a few exceptions, the road looked almost the same of a recent night.
A short running closely through the back of the street to a door that was running within the CBGB, which is now the site of a aristocratic clothing.
His walls were graphfits and a white beer bottle of 22 once beer to a group of fresh newspapers left.
A few people said they were rarely thinking about Extra Place, but they suggest that it would have to be a little disappointed.
Mr. Fields, by his part, said that some people think too undervalue the attraction of the road in his state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in black, snow and disgusting places."
The Billing Debat: Evolution in English
In this point of Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingue education.
Lance T. Izumi, an elder member in the California study and the senior director of the educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-side of the book "Not good as you think: Because the media class needs to choose a school."
Taking the Spanish electors really is a complicated business.
The educational projects of Barack Obama are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that, "the African-American and Latin students have significantly less probability to diplomate than white students, "what is true.
In order to combat these billions in achieving objectives, the educational plan of Obama is specifically supporting, among other things, "transitional bilingue education" for English students.
And the question for Obama is whether its commitment for the balanced education, which stresses the teaching in different languages than English, does not take into account its interest in covering the dictionary.
Let us, for example, take Sixth Street Prep, a elementary school in the East County of Los Angeles.
The school students are for the Spanish majority and below income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of students did the higher level test in the 2008 matematic state test.
A similar exciting 93 percent of the fourth students have made the experimental level test on English art-di-language.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from the favorite of Mr Obama.
Sixth Street highlights the recovery and exercise, constant evaluation of competences and an attitude of the type "no excuse".
Moreover, and this is that Mr Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street, the structural approach of the school for English students is "full beauty".
The use of English emphasizes the use of the English almost exclusive in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to the bilingue education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student coming from Mexico and if you were entered in the 12-month class after you wouldn't have been able to figure out what it was."
"Fun'a," he noticed "for us it works."
Obama takes to model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replica it in other Spanish majority schools and with English students?
The results reached from the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education­tions is a long-term supporter of the bilingue education) and its steadfast support for bilingue education prevents Mr Obama's response.
While he agreed that the immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the issue banal when he said that people should stop careing about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these consequences, he should consider carefully the educational models that work much than to provide them or banalize them.
The oil falls brushfully and renews the economic fear
The oil prices have been decreased brushly Monday because of concerns that even the American salvation plan for the marine seas may not be able to restore.
The future of the greenhouse has fallen from 7 per cent to 99.80 dollars at the New York market bottle in operations in the morning.
The prices have made more than 20 dollars at the bar from last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the sea of the primary materials have been exhausted from Wall Street's financial aggregation, and some powerful uragans in the Mexico Golf.
After reaching a bit of $145.26 at the barile in¤, the prices were crossed up to $90 at the beginning of this month, before re-leaving once again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial sea.
The anxiety influenced the investors again Monday even after the congress leaders had said that they had reached an agreement at the end of the week about the salvation plan, the largest of the history.
The news was darkened by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from the past.
In the last episode of the progressive fusion, Citigroup will purchase Wachovia Corporation's operations, said the Monday Government.
At the same time, Belgian, Netherlands and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European Fortis financial conglomerate.
Analysers of Barclays Capital said that frenetical negotiations on the end of the week had brought to a salvation agreement " seems to have failed to live the market feeling.
While the worst economic situation, it is expected that the question of primary materials, including oil, be calm.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and marine change rates has become uncertain," the Deutsche Bank's analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe the primary materials will not be able to escape to the county.
From a perspective of primary materials, our most pressured concern is until the American virus will spare globally and specifically in China. "
The analysts have decreased their expectations for the next year while the oil consumption of oil has been reduced because of the increased economic growth, reducing the previsions on oil price and gas by about 20 per cent for 2009.
The exploit in the second fourth signs a square record.
After spending more time of everyone with the Jets uniform at the last eight and more sessions, the defendant Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he looked forward to the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets had transformed a game without points into a rebound.
"You see something like this," Ellis said.
The second four began after the Jets and the Ar≤na Cardinals had equated the grid of the mineous clouds that overflow them with a fake.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for a evening when their growing synthesis has made a gigantiscoo in progress.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns in the quarter, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds remained at the end of the first time.
"I haven't gone out of my way," he said Favre of all the places coming to Coles.
He's a fantastic teacher.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing bills, the sample was crucially the quarterback of the Cardinals Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vagant launch and launched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
The safety of Eric§ith has planned another shipment and has intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a warner's smoke.
The last turnover, the smoke forced by Bowens, could be the most notable.
The Cardinals went in advantage of that hair owner, with 10 seconds remaining, and after the Jets had recovered the ball with 10 minutes remaining, Jay Feely cut a meta from 20 yards, for a benefit from 34 to 0.
It was more than Jets have ever signed in a quarter.
When the Jets Eric Mangini coach was asked to describe the calamity, he said, "The second fourth or the third fourth?"
When it was told him both - the Jets have granted 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I like it much more than the second fourth."
There's been a lot of points in a small timeout."
Gebsselassie relaxed over his record of the world
Heil Gebsselassie of Ethiopia has shown again because many consider it the best marathetic forever, breaking his own record of the world to the Marathon of Berlin Sunday and becomeing the first person to run a course of 26.2 miles under the 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on a favorably planning course at 2:03:59, Gebsselassie sends its score for 27 seconds at 2:03:26, last year in Berlin.
At 35 years, Gebsselassie presents the 26th record of a worldwide car that has produced a world campionate or a record of the world at all distances from miles to maratone.
The past month, Gibselslassie hopped the Impic maraton of Pechino, fearing - maybe too warmly, in retrospective - that the air intention would be worse in its asma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sold and 48 degrees at the department, 55 degrees at the arrival - Gebsselassie wins Sunday with a middle of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mil.
No half fundists such as Gebsselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have gone to long distances, the record of maratone has fallen more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won to Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday winning, Gebsselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago he had the cramps to the pool and missed a week of trains.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not arguing.
"I'm so happy," he said to the reporter.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at the end everything went well."
It was a little critical - especially in Kenya, the Eastern African Rival - because he had exhaustively orchestrated his garments, generally avoiding many of the best marathetic stars in the world, counting on the open as if it was a middle-fond court, and putting the records of the world over the sense of competition.
But these critics rarely decrease the size of the powers of Gebsselassie as maratone.
With the caught of four Keniani Sunday, Gebsselassie reached the half road point at 1:02:04.
Two elite kini corners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have held in competition Gebsselassie after the opens are ss.
By less than three miles from the arrival, Gebsselassie made a final impennate to separate himself from Kwambai, which ended at 2:05:36, improveing his best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the female garage, Irina Mikitenko, birthday of the Kazakhstan, which is now German citizen, has completed a wonderful year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time of ever.
Paula Radcliffe of the Great Britain holds the record of the world at 2:15:25.
The firstborn, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise of the Maratona of London at 2:24:14.
It lost the Pechino Games with what is described as a bad accident, but it is healed to win in Berlin, making its best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon he has run.
You have been able to make the calculations well, allowing a fourteenth of Ethiopic and Kenian running with a big distacco, retracting them after approximately 18 miles and half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia arrived at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya ended the third at 2:25:01.
In a city partly, orgasm and processes of a black life
I'm stuck in the theme park on the subborgs of Orlando, a few miles from the wonderful, from the voice, from the great, down the quiet city where the orgasm and complications of the African experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first black city inside the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer like it described in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good nutrients, enough guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pellegrinage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the Zora year! Festival to Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most important writer of Harlem Renaissance.
And in many ways, the city that he described - and who stops tourists understanding it in the tourist guide of Florida produced by the Federal Writers' Project - remains a part.
It's so indigenous, dignified and private as it was in the thirty years, when Hurston wrote that the rural black in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little of us, doesn't know what it is losing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential named Senator Barack Obama was called for a opening talk on the race, many here remain distants of the outside view.
"We are very careful about how our story is reported," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident from the life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"He must be gi."
Eatonville has been long defined as a paradox of trionph and difficulty.
It is a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2.400 where the poverty rate is twice the average.
It's a literary center but also an example of the shadow of the wilds of the southern rural culture - sometimes disdegnated, sometimes premised - born from the American slave.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are fierce and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's imagination really started with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her home city through sincere books, rich dialets, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city outside the Rout 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a scenario of black story and human drama
Low as a grandcase in life and in literature, Hurston brought the readers into the ship owned by the first office of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, for then devoted to more private areas.
"Further from the road to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, marron with white refining, with its well-holded and cortiles gardens, to which Howard Miller was always stumbled, thinking he could read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells good of all the types and whatever is suitable to the rooms."
Thus, in few hundreds of words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with analfabetism, second no and sex.
Clearly, this wasn't from Fodor.
In fact, it wasn't a retract that everyone appreciated.
"Now she said how it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls and Hurston's immortality quoting men who sing grossly songs about their wrath.
Add, "Ad some people don't like."
Hurston is still remembered here as a living excentric that often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalls that when Hurston bought in the city, he normally came without prejudice in a Chevrolt trionfant, smoking and carrying bags in a city that also benefits from the dignity apartment today.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were sogging.
"The people were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But he added, hanging on his seat on the back side of the Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was probably embraced, "he never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were out of print.
Like the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although it was a star of the literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in a football without trap in Fort Pierce, Fla.
In Eatonville there were no large memorative ceremonies, and no great conference.
"I don't believe that they understand their contribution to the world or their leave to all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
The officers of Orange County wanted to rent a five-county road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main road to two courses.
The spread of Orlando has already spint the Interstate 4 through the west border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still going back from a difficult period of his history.
The strengthened integration, in addition to other things, had ended the related Idillian isolation of the community.
In the fifth years, the racial mixture of racial mixture led hatred to the door of the community's house.
"In that period, a group of white boys came and threw the arance and things to people sitting on one side," said Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we have had a girl who was upset once.
They threw a cocomer from a car."
In a letter of 1955 at The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made to the Court a request for strengthened integration, defined its decision in Brown against the school office "a much insult than a honor for my race".
The residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite having been positive in some aspects, dismiss Eatonville cohesion and repents the confidence of his youths.
"The black kids were used to be buried - I remember this - you took your teacher tomorrow, cut off your teacher tonight," said N. Y. Nath, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the Executive Director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This duration, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You haven't broken your white teacher because your white teacher... - meaning, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nath.
Civil rights, in any way, are and create space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actor and artist who overcome the prejudices, as he did, with joyful security of himself and lines as: "How can some reject my company's pleasure!
I can't really understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker started a long road for the tomb without Hurston's target and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, a acclamated biography on the Hurston of Robert E. Hemenway has made the library scaffles, bringing it back into the American canon.
The project of the autostrade air just while his most eager daughter had spent the lights of the river again.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a salvator.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what he could destroy the state with his autoroute.
Thousands of fans came to the event two years later, and every January, many return to the memory.
A lot of years later, the state came back from his project for the road.
"The five courses of the resurrected road, have brought what the high speed would say, a real proud for the city," said Mrs. Nath.
Mrs. Boyd puts it in a way more: "Now saved Eatonville."
The victory on the autostrade project has helped to change the picture that the city has.
Those outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church in 1993, began to appear in a long number, and the residents began to revalue the past.
Eatonville added to the public history record in 1998.
A new library on a single plan (called as Hurston, obviously) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard repaired and disappointed.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomalia of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, it can give the sense of a secondary road under the extinguishing rain, small as when it was founded with 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800.
(There is 90 percent of black today.)
The outsides coming to look for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still carefully treated.
A previously requested permission is required for most of the interviews, to some things - such as the walls of the oldest church in Eatonville, which are declined from a white man, which makes black men in the fields - they have no permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a grass teacher, with a weakness for the red red, are still afraid that their island community will be fresh.
And, not Hurston Festival has spread, it has also made a high level of citizen's orgasm.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seemed his whole race: bully, problems and everything, not better, neither worse and bitter, creative, big worker, shocking and confusing as other ethnic races and groups in America.
It is honestly civic what can be heard in Mr. Franklin's nickname, Edwin Harvey's 18-year-old nickname, which is designed to return to Eatonville after the college to work in the local government or for the Department of Police, which he said he might need.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11 years old from Winter Park, seems to have learned to describe Eatonville properly.
"Most people, if they entered here, they will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing against all the other,' said Alondra Kenon after 日 in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and find a moment to look at the story, it's really a funny city."
Here in New York, we all speak fluently of finance
In the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were remote from the newspapers and from the huge TVs of Times Square, they would not be able to stand in the eyes of the cycle.
They would never be surprised that the glass offices, at nido of appeal over their tests, bankers and he’s fund managers that monopolize New York live every day the worst "broke day in office" from the 1929 crowd.
Factors shooton the metal cars for the the through the marciapies, transporting muffin vessels for coaling meetings.

The employees are still waiting for their morning bagel at the feed carrets on the marciapies, and it is still impossible to take a yellow tax between the 16 and the 19th working day.
It seemed not that there was a true crisis, until, with the whole discourse of rain and tristeness, I decided to open a new book of repair Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the fashion so that it coincided with the pause of the late afternoon to my filial of JP Morgan Chase, a cottage of about 20 was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the casier sports, to rent money or to do of ́i, but in front of the customer service sport, where old customers are books, tourists ask directions for the large storage of Macy and new clients open accounts.
Many of those who are before me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trust bankier", were in line for my own reason.
In contrast to me, however, they have already taken the reserves from the smallest banks from the places from which penalties do, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and State Island.
They took the money from such thrift (as a building company), credit partnerships and types of citizen reserve banks whose branches operate only within a state, and they say to treat customers as family.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have fallen.
In the past days, Washington Mutual, a 327 billion dollars in activity, was under the controlled administration, and, while the newyorkees were moved home for the end of the week a week on Thursday afternoon, one other, Wachovia, with 440 billion reserves, was searching for a buyer who saved her.
The employees and acts that were before me, imprisoned for another person, were moving their money to a conceived as a safe gate, which is asking for more care at Wall Street.
Common Newyorkees in the last weeks have become competent in the finance.

The muscle was profanated while Austria turned to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, at the left of the Austrian right of the Freedom Party and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian Vlaams Belang Belgian Party, participate in a manifestation to present the organization "Citizen against Islamisation" in Anversa, June 17 January 2008.
They carry signals types of the Moschee Road Representatives with a red line that passes in the middle.
The police committed the right extremists for profaning a Muslim cimiter in Austria, the same week as the political parties of the right extreme have gained much to the general elections.
More than 90 tombs were severely harmful at Traun's cimeter, in Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in which the police believed was a organized action.
The Jewish symbols like David's Star above some graves have been traced by the Jewish spray, but the detectives may have been a trial to mask extremist motivations led by hatred for the Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way linked to elections.
A portfolio of the local islamic community said that they were "profundly shioc" from the news of the profanation, which happened to the end of Ramadan, a month of religious importance for the Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria was shiped in a spiritual research travel after its right s' in the Parliamentary elections of yesterday.
The two extreme right parties who took nearly 30% of the votes, the Australian freedom party and the Alliance for the future of Austria, have made a campaign with an enormous anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans have been defined by xenofobi critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the Freedom Party, who wined more than 18 percent of the votes, has made a campaign against flights and burkas and has also expressed its opposition to foods that are considered as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brothership" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to be banding the building of moschees and minerals, considering that they are political symbols of a continuous islamization of Austria and Europe.
Reviews and analyses are immediately made after elections, which have established the extreme right as the strongest political block of the nation, indicating that the change was carried out in preference by young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel to outside prohibited to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the glamour star of the rock's rock's abuse on minors, was prohibited to travel to France and Spain from the court.
The judges set the six months in Glitter after he informed the authorities that controlled him about to go to Spain through France.
The prohibition of traveling to the outside was granted to Kent's police last June after he delivered to the judges the test of Glitter's arrests for abuses on minors.
Glitter, the true name Paul Gadi, was not present to the audience of Ashford in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyers.
A portfolio of the Court Service said: "Junk 25 September at Ashford's pretention, Kent's police have submitted a request to prevent the traveling outside Mr. Paul Gadd in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present."
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities of seeking to travel to the foreign as required by the register of condemnations for crimes.
He must give news to the authorities if he wants to travel outside for more than three days.
It is also required to give the police a preliminary seven days on its scheduled department date.
The lack of notice to the authority may lead to a sentence of five years of prison.
Kent's police said he wouldn't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter's movements in the country.
A portfolio of Kent's police said, "The Kent's police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or outside.
"From our view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have the same complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protection of Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work carefully to monitor the behavior of the consequences for crimes registered in the country to minimize any possible risk for the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls of 10 and 11 years.
When Glitter arrived, he flew to Bangkok where he had to ship a flight for London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not cause it to pass control and finally took a flight for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not let him enter and return to Bangkok where the Thai police and the immigration officers insisted to return to England.
At the end, he arrived to the terminal 3 of Heathrow on 22 August, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbrie's preach, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for a ability to insert it in the register of the convictions for crimes.
Glitter was incarcered in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having images of abuse on children.
A source of the Ministry of the Internal Minister said that Jcumbith, the Secretary of the Internal, felt disappointed and happy that Glitter was stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the teacher remote from the scene to extract the font" Günther Bauer, photograph
Don't wear or flight or dwell from the first.
Only the extent of the great teachers of the flamenc, sprayed from the concentration that characterizes interpretation, to look at the appearance of a man or woman's relaxed.
One part of the artist.
Otherwise, the person.
Two unseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a furnished look or the expression of the hands are natural because they do not have to go to scene.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" changes theatrality of some songs, ballers and chitarrists on the hall with the less known side of these teachers.
With this goal, the photograph offers a original flamenc icongraphy, covering it from various visual angles.
The show, including the programming month of the Flamenco Photography, reflects the internal importance of this ball, every day more," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" can also be common people, but seeing photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, interpreters or executors on the scene.
These people retracted "on the road" are "artists who can transfer passion, trial, joy when they are on the scene ... and catch the public.
To cover the personality of these large ones, it is not necessary to take them into scene,
Because their personality and character are inside.
What I was interested was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to catch with the photography car the personality of the big flamenc."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started in 1997 a long way to play songs, chitarrists or ballers using a photography car.
They are retracted that, due to the type of machine and material, they remember the classic photo.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving to the photo modernity, according to a idea that reflects the design of the flamenc own of Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that you and it is able to survive every day."
Not the baller, song or sound in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, and to win the public with his art.
The search of a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, in exposure in these days at the El Fotomata gallery.
Famous flamenc artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of approximately seventy retraits artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of the flamenc, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the exposed retractions at the time of the show.
The passion for the retraits brought Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with the "SportART Project Retraits of Veteran athletes" ("Sportart Project").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photograph admits "I love finding people, knowing them and able to penetrate for a moment in their life, that is a long or short moment.
I think the retraction is the most difficult type of photography.
You meet or compare people, persons that sometimes you don't even know or who are allowing you just a few minutes to scan the photo.
In the outside of these circumstances, like a photograph, I always try to concretize my ideas."
The collection of retraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is allied at the gallery El Fotomata, at the 20th road of la Mata, parallel to Alameda de Hercules, and will be opened to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa surprises that the romance that is writing is a "assardo"
It is enhanced in places that still don't know and treat unknown issues: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is taken with a new project to which he works, a romance whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is a Ireland's inhabitant who has lived twenty years in Congo and has passed through the Amazonia.
Since always favorite for the Nobel Price for the Letterature, the writer confessed yesterday in the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project that is busy today is "a race" and that "all indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If you have a good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it equally and I hope to finish it as before," he concluded his intervention at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that you have seen through the city of the Acquedote a hundred writers, historicals, journalists and thousands of people.
The ́ee of "The city and los dogs" was, as from pronostic, the figure of spick at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival premium to be the most voted writer of the participants – an ancient edition of the book "Our mutual friend" of Dickens, has filled the posts of the teater Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer was found before a public to which he was flying the time when the Peruian, with a wonderful and great memory of humorism, repeated the letter vocation, resulting from the "excellent aventure of reading" and "life beyond what I lived"; as it writes in "discriminated mode" to supplie the "manque of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, recycling and continuous refund; such as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "the images of memory" are the foundation on which his accounts have been found.
The Spanish-American Romanian, he said "not a way" to measure and know whether the books can change the life of people, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, a efficiency," he highlighted Vargas Llosa, underlined that, in contrast, "he has effects" and that "wears the most anticonformists." So he invited the writers to "do not cease to the frivolity" and "assume the ability" of his vocation.
The time prevents the Festival of Pooblanco, privating it from running
The festival of the runs that had to suggest the days of the Pooblanco Festival was suspended yesterday after the towers selected for the runs had verified that the conditions of the ground of the board were not suitable.
So, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Hernandez, the company decided to suspend the celebration of the course.
The intellectuals were accommodated against this Festival by preventing the feast of two days on three.
Saturday, the rain prevented the execution of the second cycle of tours.
In cartons, Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista had to face a tower of Castillblanco.
Therefore, the Festival had regular execution on Friday.
In this occasion Daniel Luque was trionfare, cutting three ears and was brought out in a trionfo, after he was shot with a pleasure and aesthic.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante had completed its two runs by achieving health and an ear, granted more by the public than for the course itself.
The worst of all was El Julie, walking from Los Llanos' area without glory and no pen.
With the second tower, after a tremendous mule, it has gained the fish of greater part of the public.
A car with two thousand kilograms of hashish exceeds the blocking place at Alava
Five less than ten of the morning.
Agencies encourage the height to the two employees of a car, instead of stoping, to flee.
The agents intimated the height to the two employees of a car, instead of stoping, to flee.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after they have been invoked can arrest one of the two employees, a man of approximately 28 years, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the Communication of the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested entity shall be carried out by the trafficking of drugs and public documentation.
The incident occurred when some Alava's road officers were conducting a control of transports on N-1, where this crossed the Common Circuit of Armiñon.
They were attempting to stop an inspection vehicle when the driver, crossing the eggs, accelerated brushfully and crossed the blocking place.
The agents have been given up until the vehicle, after a few kilometers, stopped on the road border, and his two employees have been given to flee into a forest area.
The agents of Ertzaintza were so able to arrest one of the refugees and to sequence the 2.178 kilograms of hashish that were transporting and taking action once the car was investigated, a Iveco Daily.
The hashish panels, which were on the back side of the vehicle, were then placed under police care for a complete investigation and the detection of the weight.
Furthermore, since the officers agreed that the matrix was "duplicated" because it was not compatibil with the documentation reported in the carrier, it was also imposed in arrest the crime of public documentation.
Ertzaintza continues the investigations to arrest the second suspected person, who has been able to escape as already said, and to determine the survival of the drug.
The holder A. A. J., of 28 years, was led to the police station to perform the appropriate procedures and to be available to the judge in the next hours.
Stop the Heather Locklear actor for guidance under the pharmaceutical effect
Actor Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the Popular Series Melrose Place, was arrested this week in Santa Barbara (California) for guidance under the effect of farms.
A witness saw it and had a risky manvre while trying to get out with the car from the parking in Montecito, as revealed in the newspaper People from a portfolio of the California road.
The Witness indicated that the Locklear was at 16.30, "shoot the accelerator, making a lot of sounds, and trying to carry out the car from the parking with brass in front and back. By turning backwards, he had more times before his eye on the sun."
Shortly later, the witness, who first seen, appearingly hadn't acted the actor, saw that Locklear was stopped in a nearby road and was out of the vehicle.
It was this person to warn the emergency services, because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actor sitting inside his vehicle, which was partly blocking the road.
"He seemed confused," and therefore the agents led it to a specialist center for drug use and alcohol to submit it to a test.
According to a police portfolio, the actor has proved active and the hypothesis of alcohol excess has been separated from the beginning, even though "subjectly as observed by the officers at the first time, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some pharmaceuticals."
Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of guidance under the effect of some not best specified substance and was closed in the local prison around at 19:00 to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was recoverable from a specialist clinic in Arına after being revered after an anxiety and depression episode.
Chamazares highlights the andalusa federalization of the IU to take place their own properties in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator of the UI and member of the Partie Iz≤da Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that the regional Federation of the training will take a decision on the case of the former advocate to Juventu and the Sport of the Community of Siviglia, Francisco Manuel Silva, which has signed the releases last week after the customer's accusation.
"In these cases, they are particularly federalists, and the andalous organization will be to have its own ability," he said in relation to the resolution that the party will have to adopt in confront with what has been adequate in the Sivilian Council until today.
However, the leader of the UI highlighted the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have done. "The UI always wanted that this type of investigations we have the maximum transparency."
Similarly, he highlighted that training is regulated by "very rigid ethics codes for all public loads".
"Sangre de Mayo", the scom ́ epica in Garci
Inspiring to Episodios Nacionales of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci replies in Sangre de May the Spanish ri ́s against the French, which is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the register tried to "to illustrate the torrent of persons and at the same time the social analysis" who always loved the work of the Romanian, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevari would lead to a large cast of interpretations.
Sangre de May, longer than two hours and half, debuted this Friday in the cinema sales, to become a television ministerial in the future of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
Great amateur of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci, supports that he has performed with this dream "a dream of his childhood", and he believes he must thanks for the hope Aguirre, which from the Community of Madrid had commanded him three years before turning a memorative film for the second centurion of May 2th. The register had accepted a covenant that the story was based on the Roman Episodios Nationales.
The 15 million budgets allocated by the Community in Madrid represented a "unique opportunity" for Garci to re-create the scenographics and the costs appropriate to recover a "storted Spain who wronged the choice of the leader to fight and the fact that the fight for indigenousness led to the people a great loss in the development under the kingdom of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the register has not received any funds equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double than Sangre de May, so it has not been possible to turn some scenes provided by the scenario that he himself had signed in Horacio Valcarcel, a chairman of almost all his car.
This, for the Registration of Volver to start, has influenced what is its habitual work practice, the scene with the actors, with which often uses to try before turning to those who will not be part of the cast, because it considers it "humiliar," considering that "part of the work of the register lives in the theatre and the cinema to know what it is going to happen in the field where it works."
Many of the interpreters, part of whom they enter in the cast of Sangre de May, test before their car, such as Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that no of the three candidates to represent Spain this year at Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de May, You're French billar tables and, the last selected Los girasoles blinds -, they represent the youngest generation of the Spanish cinema "which should be known instead."
From this film, Garci doesn't expect premises.
"In the beginning you think you're working for posters, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and at a certain point you agree to turn a film in more," explains Garci after more than 30 years of car.
Isabel Bayon risks the Sivilian extent of the ballerin Tortola Valencia
A Sivilian ballerin makes an oomage to another ballerin equally of Siviglia.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalanic father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and and andalusa mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in Triana's quarter, and at the age of three years he moved with the family to London.
It was a free dance ballerin and a specialist in east dance.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of the female emancipation, of Isadora Duncan calibro, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian, and it was the cause of abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The lives of this woman, who faced a revolution in the field of dance and estate in Europe between the two wars, have always fought Isabel Bayon.
"I'd like to work with Pepa'oa and you offer me this person. I looked incredible."
He supports the ballerin: "We do not want to tell his whole life, but collect the spirit.
The titles of his dance have suggested me some basic elements of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the maripose" suggested me a guai, or "the dance of the serpent" some tanks.
His dance was sensual and it was told me that my way of balling also comes into this estic," explains.
The scene provides two contributions here: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of its spectaculars, as it looks to "The open door" and the Master Matilde Coral, who, here, wanted to work with the one who was his alliance.
"Matilde interprets a adult Tortola, the personality of maturity.
I'm happy because you accepted working in my work and I feel very honest of this."
It also includes the musical and chitarristic composition such as Jesus Torres and Áriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the violation of Rafa La Viola and the acting of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "which interprets the role of eternal accompanyer of these artists who were too tough, and that they have always had many spacious."
In the work there is also in some way the life of this woman that is running in remote places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole Europe, because it was usually in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think it's one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given history period and now no one remembers it and so less thinks its operation as something of value" supports Bayon.
The spectacle will begin today at 20.30 p.m. at Lope de Vega theater.
With the publication of the "Daily of a recently married poet" the Trinity is also closed
The presentation of the first edition of the "Diary of a Poeta Recencasado" at the Church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, enters into the activities scheduled by the Asessorato to the Culture of the Joint of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennio de Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to remember the fifty-year-old anniversary of the Nobel Price's signature for literature and death of both of them.
Thus, the "Trienium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with this operation, with the Interna Congress, which has been executed in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the showing it "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This chopo de light", which was invoked last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, will come to New York together with the Interna Congress.
Moreover, the Assessorate to the Culture of the Joint of Andalusia has gained a total of 800 copies of the "Day of a Rezencased Poeta", with care of Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to promote the distribution of the figure and the work of one of the most highest poets.
America likes a little bit without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of this."
The phrase is of the actrice Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the imperfection of the American cinema, and of all America, before the disgusting idea that Newman has gone.
And he costed him to get him a Oscar.
And since 2007 he was in pension.
And he knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard course for everyone.
"Always what a proof is going over any expression, and I now have a great friend," Robert Redford wept, "My life and my country could be better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exhausting.
A father of the cinema and the patriarch was dead at a particularly dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and the sea, with the self-estimation of the American people to earth, to the devastated research of new motivations to feel deceived.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and remain good people to love, you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he cared for the platform ideal of wrath and truth.
He was an official oppositor of Richard Nixon and the defensor of lost and wines, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn dead overdose to the creation of the brand of marriage and biological food.
All gifts to a country to which it has been able to go much more than a selfish food culture.
The wall of employment was over Hollywood, without being treated, not by nativeness, nor by passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Wire, noticed that a man wasn't dead, has ended a time.
Another English, Sam Mendes, registered with Oscar, said that working with Newman had nothing but the cotton of his car.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Family Crowe, was encouraged to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of high level for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trying to live today as Paul Newman did: keeping highly regarded the rightness requirement and having a serious and remote privacy life from the rooms.
This is not always easy or possible in the median jungle of today.
However, some prove us, and Paul Newman has a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, whom he remained faithful, even though he didn't really miss the opportunities for him to be.
"Why am I going to eat out of hamburger today, if I have a box in my house?" She solved to screw.
In heaven, he is aware of the fierceness that his daughters are also his amiratrics on earth, which is not so common in America.
"For all the great roles that he interpreted, no one was so proud as of the devoted husband, loving father, no healed and filantrope," they say.
The imperfect course of a Madrid ́impica
Yes, the dream of many of us is that the Olimpiades will be in Madrid before or then and, after the trial failed for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow the example of the course yesterday, I would just say no!
They've called her the "perfect course", but I think it's been the worst I've attended.
A lot of shooches, which, if they had later been taken into account in the act of the assessment and I would have to examine them, the response would be absolutely negative.
But we're going for it and starting from the beginning.
The shoochees started with the retraction of the throat, which assumed that it was going before.
It didn't seem to be a wrong idea, but if they forced you to go, that's to retreat everything (including the chip to avoid codes during the garage).
In addition, no.
You had to go just to take the darsal (from shadow, just go for this) and (after the relative code) surprise! they had only magliettes of size 'S' (second shadow, because I need a XL width).
In what world do we live?
Is it the crisis if they have decided to buy only small magliettes, which are made with less tissue and then less costous?
Well, things of this type are inevitable than the same day of the course.
Besides to go very quickly to take the chip, the waiting cup was 15 minutes and, for more, you had to keep the cup.
The expectation is more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a course to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was predictable, the course began that we hadn't even deceived the wheel, though, when it was successful in the company, the recovery also resulted worse.
Moreover, the rain of mine waited for more than 40 minutes, which was added to temptations of people's rebelliousness and appealed to the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have the pulmonate, and some, like me, will not even find out in the proper classification because of the chip that, I guess, has not registered correctly the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect course, this will not be sure of my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream a well-prepared city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emergency technologies, Microsoft presented in preview a new image and human interaction system, a kind of artificial, but without much ability to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a tax (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a navigated service to move within the company's campus) by assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of shapes and faces, this "receptist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and listening and understanding the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group the presents in conversation groups.
In the video of example, the recipient finds a third person, but it understands that it does not belong to the group with which he is talking and that it is not a company.
He's asking if he's there to visit someone and he says he's gonna be in his position shortly.
Everything without blue.
Impressionant.
But this is, of course, the future.
Now the company has better focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week you've been very talking about a change in Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were given the essential and less lovers of commercial spacing functions, they would go five times faster – hey!
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version, has continued to add to Windows features and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft has the right: the operational system will always lose more importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome in the network, you were one of those who supported the theory that was the first Google to compete with Windows.
Many rightly highlight that a browser is not a operating system.
The operational system will always be needed because it is an unusual element to communicate hardware and software.
Do the same function of your wife or husband when you have something to say to your wife.
It's true.
It will never escape, but it may be necessary to think of the "death" of the operational system not as a absolute truth but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always give less attention to the operational system, and more to the web browser.
You take the computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and daily we work more time by navigating online than in a remote window environment.
What is the half of the applications of the operational system?
At least it's more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than View.
Less weighty, less overwhelming, less complete.
Microsoft is interested in more integrating their online services so that they may have a valid Google alternative.
They have a disappeared need, in fact, and I bring a little example here.
I scraped the photo inserted in this post in one of the regeneration sites for Microsoft's dictionaries, in Redmond, at the beginning of this month.
On the kidney car, a cart highlights them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an indigenous study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft's searches use Google to perform a network search.
Last week, in the rest of the week, the rest of the rest was confirmed in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be marketed in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to run Windows 7 together and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is always become more a computer.
But the rest, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso brought her to the Azurra Costa, Caprio's replied in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond de blood', as well as Al©ino in 'Il Padrino' of Francis Ford Coppola as part of the typical uniform of the gay muscle park.
And if we try to count the stars' appearances, we can revoke the image of the fortunate with the climbs that lift the weights in the walking circle.
It is, in substance, of the typical man-mallet, with the inside of cottons, attracted and without hands.
It's the 'tank', as the Anglofons call it, even though the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel spies over all.
The "Marcel" highly respected others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex tail, for its distinctive set and for the small Belgian flag (as soon as possible), which the most emblematic models of the maille are brought as a detail on the area.
The "Marcel" is excellent to the other for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex tail, for its distinctive summa and for the small Belgian flag (as soon as possible), which most emblematic mallet models bring as a detail on the area.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian dite doesn't only refer to the "tank".
Comprehensive also for the college, boxer returned, cashmer cardigan, cotton bottles, marinary magliettes, baby-dolls, mini short...
Intimate clothes thought to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as an intimate whiteness.
I'm too good.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't care for me."
The great comparison with her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica\z is small, but full of life.
Currently, sisters have taken very seriously their new activities in the field of mode.
For Monica, I'm much more than beautiful girls and celebrity that give their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that Mango's signature has made its new seat, besides the presentation of the most important premiums than the Spanish mode house sponsorizes.
Calm and scared, he's getting you quickly.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we have imagined my sister Penelope and I for the autumn winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and at the dinner at the Opera in the honor of Valentino.
We say, a very intense day, but at the same time, emotional.
From what elements are your new collection for Mango at this fourth work season for Spanish house?
Be to my sister that I like the cinema of the 50s is 60s, from here we get a number of inspirations.
Then, I love in the town and watch how to clothe women, how they combine and mix their clothes. I often do it.
Ballerina, actor and stylist, you're a very versative woman, right?
I think yes, even though it is at the end, it's all influenced and there are many common elements.
By little, they liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to wear in my grandmother's arms and to see her apartments.
It was a bomb, better even to go to the game park.
Then, once ballerin, I always gave much attention to the clothes.
You know that the ballers like to have a style to go to the lesson and wise, to look at the speech and feel good.
And in the role of the actor, when they show you the watchoba is the time you really meet the person.
So, everything is going together, yes, with very respect for stylists and professionals.
Not a long time ago, you've been 30 years old, you've been in crisis?
No, no.
He never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I feel that women at that age are married and have a good experience to deal with the life by doing less of errors.
The biological hour doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted to be a little bit, and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're gonna be a mother, right?
Of course, I know that I'm gonna be a mother because my own body asks me, and I want to be a young mother, that I don't want to.
As regards the candidate, I don't care too much.
What I will do will give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with love.
As regards the cinema, you're expected to scan in different sales some films rotated last year.
That's right, and I want them to go.
As a woman coming from the theater, I'm very inquiet and anxious, I'd like everything right now and clearly, but it can't always be like this.
I want to go "The last hour" and "Search for Christ's Tub."
Let's see if you'll like it.
A few days ago, you've debutted the peak with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not that I've been in a patrol like a model.
It is simply Naomi Campbell, who I know for a long time, invited me to go to London to participate in a well-being shop for his organization "Dane for a better world" and the apartments that we have expelled – I brought two parts of our collection for Mango - they were sent to this to collect funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this side of Naomi.
They say so many things about her, that I and I know her from a long time I can confirm you that they are not so true.
Moreover, I am with this good part in which you are coin.
He asked me to screw for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the plan, I would have done it equally.
If it's for women in the third world, you can't get back.
Recent alcoholism drivers will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive rate of alcohol in the blood, install in his car the system that prevents the drive of the vehicle in the state of ebrity or if it is not inappropriate.
The implementation has been announced last and is already included in the annual report of the Governing Board, which will be a pilot project for a year.
The objective of this project is reintegration of the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In this initiative, beyond the General Procedure for Straight Safety, they will participate in the General Direction of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institution for Car Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of cars reported more than once for leading in the state of ebrity return to the car.
Alcohol would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the respiratory air and prevents the car to move if the driver does not soff, or when a higher alcohol concentration is found than that.
The cost is over 1000 euros and would be charged by the healthy.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that the vehicles of these devices are allowed to reduce up to 65% of the crimes committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is calculated that it could save the life of 115 people per year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to put these behaviors in front of criminal crimes.
And to facilitate development, since the legal reform can be carried out by way, and, of course, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require a organic law.
However, the device is not still on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even though it has already been introduced in experimental ways in some industrial and public vehicles.
Tomorrow the Congress of Members will vote for a initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system in school bus, as it has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British puntuality at 17.40, second programme, the Spanish airport in which the principles of the Asturies traveled in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez of Mexico Airport.
The sun was swimming, but the races still used the hand as a vision to see the real couple descending from the air.
At the feet of the list, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
Sometimes before I asked a taxist for the road if he knew that the Spanish principles were to visit the city to formalize a official journey.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that moment... you're from here or...
- No, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a few years.
- Oh, very good...
Mexican pressure, however, knows very well who are the principles of the Asturies and the importance of the travel.
Many of them are waiting in the hangar of the airport shooted on the red tape and the military cordon composed of 27 marine soldiers who offer the health of honour.
The prince seems sorrowful, dressed in the blue sea, and you, the princess, calling the wind, very sorry, does not use its habits "peep-toes", maybe told her that in Mexico City threatened a bad time.
They give the photos a smile and a short stone before they go to the room where the official committee is waiting for them.
By the door of the hotel in which the alloggian, one of the four largest in the city, expects them a spiritual reporter of the mexican television.
The best premium offered by mode
There is probably no place in the most appropriate world to present a mode premium, which doesn't Paris and probably does not exist a more busy and good living stylist of Valentino.
Mango has presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to favor the internal promotion of new talents in the mode field.
It offers a premium of $300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in Mango's vector at the number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept from emotion.
On the other hand, it is the second trade of the dictator for size in Europe and it was opened with 1.335 square metres.
The first is located in London.
Such events, united to the desire to please the Valentino stylist who presided the concurrence jury, had started with a luxe dinner at the Opera Garnier of Paris.
With the nearest chagal television, the Chagal presidential table prepared by Mango was still more spectacular.
Nati, with the inflated heart and doing need for virtue, due to the recent death of the brother, took a apartment of the House and some complements of ELAH to take the cup and the arm of the son of Luis - a boy of almost two meters of height - accompanied Valentino to the presidential of the holiday.
Andik, owner and gentleman of Mango, has done the honors of the house and the horse that he's finished, as well as Barone Rohovil, without a jacket, because they both had been sent to two ladies.
Monicaház, who has managed the shopping in cups and trucks – designed by his hand – was transformed for the dinner, carrying a long black-sensual apartment and emotionated during the nightly companioned by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the room for the wise ballet and she, remembering other times, took a bar and cut a "grand-plus".
Inés Sastre didn't stop for the places of the palace, but she had shown us the photos of her son on the cell.
On the next day, we were happy for Olivier Martinez’s presence – other boys who move in a motion - and John Tra®, who came to the Intercontinental Hotel of Paris, with his lensuolas, his asciugamans, and were assured in preliminary, that there were no shoes in his room.
Star under the star heaven of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the caotic and frenetic daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all collected into a book that will bring relax in the library on 30 September.
Awake is almost a chastisement when it swallows every morning at 7, but it is still worse to imagine to be involved in the frenetic ryth of modern life.
The Office is called tension and the bad computer.
Stress is the bad of the 20th century.
However, there are not one and two methods to fight daily exhaustion and difficulty to escape from the world of work.
No, this number goes to nothing more and nothing less than 100
Outside the yoga positions, classic massing or "spa", Susannah Marriott collects in its book pages, all a "menu" options on measurement for pleasure and time of each.
The anti-stress operation is named "1001 ways to relax" and its peace will reach libraries thanks to the Pearson Alhambra and DK editor.
If someone thinks that it is impossible to gain peace in the ambitious ways such as the worker or in personal relations, this "manual" delays this conviction.
Moreover, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural that contribute to relax.
If adrenalina doesn't go in your venes to find the body balance and stress has become a problem, it's the time to sit on the pool, spread the mind and focus on reading.
Talk in the dream
Some kids talk during the night.
I don't refer to those who wake up very hurt to tell us something that has happened to them on the day, but to those kids who speak still sleeping.
The first time there is, it takes a fear, but it doesn't really have much importance.
It is a good change in the dream defined dream.
It appears with certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, most of you have recognized that you were talking in the dream.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporatic way (one time in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with a greater regularity (all day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
These are episodes related to other troubles of dream such as the in·, the night fears, the night enrusis (doing it to bed), or sonnabulism, but it is not necessarily so.
As already accentuated in prevention, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress or surrounding.
In any case, it's still a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet voice tone, with slow words, almost in a surrounding or that occurs the opposite (urla, cry, long talks ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be necessary to observe the child and, eventually, consult a specialist to check if there are some issues that generate anxiety anxiety as I feel about the situation.
We said that this is a good change, therefore, there is no treatment unless it is associated with other dream disorders that may be treated (e.g. if it is accompanied with insomnia or stress situation).
However, what can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to eat the child too much before he goes to sleep.
Promote quiet games and avoid programs or television series that survive fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for which it is fair to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to gain a certain internal calm.
This will allow the child to sleep quietly.
Once the dreamers look at trying to keep calm.
Remember that they are unexpected for the child and that the day later will not remember anything of what happened.
Used advice
Don't wake it up.
It's unusual, because it's not conscious of what's going on, and you'll stop the dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's relaxing.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency is better to consult a doctor or to check where such a great anxiety results in the child.
If you understand what he says (that is not the most common situation), do not fall in trying to make him a questionnaire to get information.
You will not get anything, because it's sleeping, and so it's not conscious to organize your thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what you dream to say, so you need to give much attention to the interpretation of information and conclusions that these could be brought to.
You never tell the kid that you could ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even through the screen.
Something like this causes a great anxiety.
Soon, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that takes only a few minutes.
The island... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found the way of the victory home after a long period of infringement.
Without a terrible game, the Yellow-ners have created the largest number of network opportunities by transforming one in the game winning.
The time was not much supported during this meeting when the attackers were expressed in fatigue.
After a first temptation of the Captain of Guest Kauffmann, who sprayed the seven with a far-term, Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other caused the Dannemarie's, Funderflick from far, then high Hirn, Point Romein and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie answered with a block in the center of the field, left only the Riahi scatened in an attack point.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporary for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais network for Ilhaeusern, well placed, rejected a ball on a first temptation of Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern can't be able to disappoint his long happiness and will be ejected a decade of minutes after that leaves his squadra companions in digital lowerness.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to use it and will not cause great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, unintentionated to "fortrify" the harvest, except in the last minutes of ­ when, after a rocamboletic action, the ball was disturbing the cross.
Sarkozy meet fishers in the collar
Before you go to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will get to the britain.
The President of the Republic decided to go on Thursday morning to Guilvinec, in the Department of Finistère, to encourage the representatives.
The last promised to collect it "with a constructive spirit" and they hoped "to present with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that is currently at the same time with the General Assembly of the "Krise Committee" created by the British fishers to take measures to face the impending price of the gas, which reached its record with a average of EUR 1,14 per litre.
According to the portfolio of Eliseo David Martinon, the President will "debat with them about the possible solutions to the companies to recover and to ensure the conditions of work and refund of the mariners".
The fishers expect Nicolas Sarkozy to stop.
Thursday morning, they conducted "Lumaca operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 miles of anger.
The Port of Quiberon has also been locked, but the links with Belle Islands have not been interrupted.
On the penis of Quiberon, a road block has been carried out.
Monday, the mariners have already proved their determination by burning, from the white, pneumatics and palettes in front of the brest and Lorient ports, while they took foot manifestations in Concarneau and Saint-Brie.
The movement was extended to the ports of the Atlantic Coast and Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Venezia, where the fisheries remained at the molecular or to Havre, where a twenty-year-year ships have prevented the movement of trade ships.
The fishers of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Atlantic Loira, interrupted the block of the refinary note of Donges at night.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer, they decided to wait for the meeting that will be held on Thursday in the ministry to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "Christ Committee" will decide on Thursday the future movement action and the eventual participation in the meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing in Paris.
However, some British fishers do not want to be represented by the Committee on Fisheries, which did not support the movement.
"Shooper will continue" because "the fishers will not cease" and "not intend to move to Paris", he announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Committee on the Fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishers, who do not pay gas taxes, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they estimate that the limit of a vessel rent is reached only with a gasoil less than EUR 0,30 per litre.

"All this indicates how much the market would count on the project," he added, fearing that in some days it could already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was actually deadly... then the witness would have passed quickly to the Fed – Federal Reserve - (the American Central Affairs, ndr) and other central banks to resume the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions," he warned Brian Bethune, the finance sector and → at the Global Insight.

Obama in advantage to the first television dual
After the first debat of Friday between the two candidates in the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without surprise, the general quarters of the Republican and Democratic campaign have published the respective victory of the television dual, followed by a third of the American family.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, despite the worthful, was not enough to allow him to break the calf in the investigations at five weeks from the presidential.
The Institute Gallup, of which a weekly published review of opinions, provides a benefit of five points in Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), shows that the democratic had the best.
A instant investigation conducted by CbsNews on a campaign of indecisive electors, discovered that 39% of them believe Obama the winner, while 25% points on McCain.
A fine performance from his companion of Joe Biden, expected during the first and unique debate with the reval Sarah Palin, should confirm the benefit of Obama.
"Subvaluing it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition, however," he warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventeenth McCain has never stopped to promote his inexcusable experience in external policies, underlineing the "inhumanity" of the opposer on the issues related during the first face.
"The Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." He often told many repeatedly.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and powers necessary to be president."
What since yesterday has a continuous distinction for the republic TV campaign.
Obama, from his side, underlined how his choice would represent a new future.
Without extending, it has been concise and precise.
He promoted its pre-disposition to the right decisions and the intention to restore the picture of the United States on the world scene.
"McCain has never understood, in contrast to Obama," he recalled, this week, a democratic spot, refusing the Republic to have not adopted the measures necessary to face the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
In the nineteen minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, he declared Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a rain, for a electoral meeting.
He has not even spoken the words "medium class" or "workers". The financial crisis is going to Obama, considered by the Americans as the most appropriate person to save the → on the corner of the precaution.
"The next week could represent a decisionable s·," he thought, yesterday, the influenced democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an ex member of the Clinton Administration, compared Obama's intention in economic matter to that demonstrated by Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the crollo · is "the final verde after eight years of economic pessimistic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Regarding the intention of reducing rates for 95% of the Americans despite Wall Street's results, the Senator of I\nois also mentioned between its priorities the achievement of an eventual energy indigenous country thanks to the promotion of renewable energy and the activity of a health security system.
McCain, on his side, would build a park of 45 nuclear centres until 2030.
The two candidates, with a view to the incitated requests on the financial safeguard plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted last night the Congress and extremely populated.
In Minsk, "Do you notice that there were elections?"
Youths and opponents showed on Sunday evening in the main board of the Belarus capital to predict the results of the legislation.
Some hundreds of Belaruses were gathered on Sunday evening after the closure of electoral seats in Minsk's Central Place to protest against the fraudulent character of legislation.
While the results were still expected, many young people came to demonstrate the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, release".
Some confess that they haven't voted, "To what kind? They will do what they want from my vote," says a boy.
They don't believe that that the scheme which has made it represents forward to the external observators in order to bring up the dialogue with the European Union is ready to introduce a democratic deficiency.
The sanctions, including the vision of 40 whiterussian leaders and the congelation of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legally by observers.
It wasn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the Electoral Committees, and our observers could not participate in the vote breakdown," Jouri Potemkine, a portfolio of the Democracy Forces Union, claimed.
"It is a change in facet, underlined Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of opposition to the presidential of 2006 and the capofil of the pro-European movement, because the importance is who counts the tables and in this case is the executive.
If Members of opposition come to Parliament, it is why they have been appointed, not elections.
But their income in Parliament can be a television, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposite has therefore the need to enter into the political framework because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our →, which is crucially debt with Russia, comes into crisis, and we do not make any reform, we are able to become a Russian protector.
Now we want to be angry."
The opposite is that the ‘Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, is the validity of the investigation.
It underlines that the quotas of participation seem too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in front of the vote (26% of the electors in Minsk) has given the way to each type of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections?" He asked the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two free political prisoners this year, in August.
There was no one in the electoral sections.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, the most convenient powerful."
The night silence falls on October's road.
In television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Committee are successful.
Meeting - The blood is back safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of his foundation, and his president, Dr. FrancineD.
In particular, he recovered the public's confidence, seriously lost from the infection blood scandal between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the blood reserves managed by the Canadian Croce Rosa Transfusion Service were infected by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the context of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public investigation directed by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to light on circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to spread recommendations to prevent the resistance of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was late to set a report, some provinces allocated a committee with the goal of ideating a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was made and held by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the reports Gélineau et Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to provide the Quebec and the Canadian Society du blood (Canada Society of Blood) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started its own activities, 38% of people claimed that they still have confidence in the donations system in Quebec, remember Dr.
The situation was killing.
Thanks to continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood pregnancy and research in the field during the following years, we have recovered public confidence," she explains to be proud that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Decary, however, is convinced that "the confidence is something extremely fragile."
By its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec applied the principle of precaution.
At the time, it was assisted in Europe in many cases of the human variant of the foolish muck, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's seed, which has been reported at the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know absolutely if that disease could be transmitted through infection.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Reports Krever and Gélinau, according to which, when there are doubts and may be a serious disease, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob seal that is manifested with a degeneration of the brain that leads inevitably to death, are adopted exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had passed more than one month in the United Kingdom from 1980 was rejected.
Now, a few years ago, it has been demonstrated that this disease has been transmitted without doubt through infection.
This episode showed us that he had a sense of applying the principle of precaution."
In 1999, there was a much more higher market technology for HIV-dividuation: nuclear acid tests (TAN) that allow directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not the anticorps against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, or since the person has contracted the disease in which the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
The period could be reduced to a duration less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not able to identify them is so significantly decreased.
Increasing improvements have allowed significantly to reduce the risk of contrary to AIDS with blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million faces the risk of receiving blood infected from HIV virus.
"In other words, that means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood campions before someone is infected by HIV virus.
As Hema-Quebec distributes between the 400 000 and the 500 000 blood campions each year, there will be more than 24 years before a HIV case is transfused with transfusion.
I think we can feel quiet today in receiving or predicting a blood transfusion to restore health, states the head of the Hema-Quebec direction.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what patogen will occur in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Reunion that, like the Nilo O≤ale virus, is transferred into the blood by an insect.
It must be constantly watched," Dr. Decary continues before stressing that in addition to having safe resources, Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient provisions.
"The needs increase because the old population is old.
As treatments against the most aggressive cancer, patients often need a supply of red or plastic globules.
The age of the population has also consequences on the number of donors that in average only 3% of the people of Quebec acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who have 18 years and who respond to the criteria of admissibility can give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
In the meantime, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted because they have been held by AIDS or Malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where this last is distributed, they will be rejected for a period equal to one year.
"with this 3% we can maintain a inventary to respond to hospital needs.
The cases of pain are very rare.
But the members of this group of donors must be renewed with hands that are older and are not able to do donations anymore.
Now it is difficult to convince people to give blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today life is so frenetic that it is difficult for a hour to give blood," says desolated Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec distributes not only blood campions, but also human weights, of which the bones, the eye gloves and the skin that are almost used for serious exhibitions.
• Tessuti are analyzed, transformed and frozen before they are held at Hema-Quebec who manages the only public of the blood of ombelical cordons in Quebec.
In the ombelical cordone, which once was considered a biomedical discovery, enough blood of stamina cells that can be used to cure serious diseases such as leucemia.
"We've been celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion in our thousands of cordon blood campions and we're planning to take more than a thousand every year.
It should be started to be proportional to the trapants at the beginning of the next year," recalls Dr. Decary that describes this practice of preliminary blood of cordon as a very popular.
"Too many moms are deceived that you can't have access," because Hema-Quebec has no means necessary to offer this complete and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Calcio - The Semifinal Effect
The Impact Montréal has been qualified for the semifinal eliminators of the series A, winning 3-1 against the Sounders of Seattle yesterday, during a second decisive game of the final quarters at the Stadium Saputo.
The center campaign Antonio Ribeiro signed the decisive goal at the 90th.
After a first time without goal from both parties, David Text and Rocco Plano signed the following networks for the Montreal.
For Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Remember that at the first party of the Indian-Retorn, Thursday, the Impact had soon disappointed 2-1 to Starfire Complex, Tukwila, in Seattle's periferia.
The impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in the semifinal.
Saturday night in Minnesota, Thundler took a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to face Whitecaps both on Thursday and Thursday, but further details will be confirmed at the day.
Shortly - Covalev's decisional networks
The Canadian and its axes are ready to restart the season.
The three formats by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, yesterday at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, signed a goal, made two of them, and collected a victory, in the fourth of the preparing games of the Habs.
It decides for the winner the only signed Kovalev network.
"I'm not still ready," he warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel at my age."
"He tried to break up in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think I appreciate the outcome of the game.
There was an ovation."
Charest points north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the initiation of elections before the end of the year.
Concluding the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to be elected in occasion of partial elections today.
"Please the borders of our last large north border": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, which was presented to Levis yesterday by means of instruments from the strong visional impact, in occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
After him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mulino to Images".
On three maxis, they confunded negative spectaculars of hydroelectric diges, mineral cultures, images of Quebec viewed with "Google Maps", cards, etc.
Great means like in full electoral campaign.
In addition, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the initiation of autonomous elections, even though he noted that he was very committed.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" which the Prime Minister states to have for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on handwork, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
In the most recent talks of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North Territory at the 49th parallel had never been subject to a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, has limited to explain why the North would be "a joy of the great potential," but he did not speak about temptations or investment quotas, as he did not explain the exact priorities in the implementation of future projects.
Moreover, it has been limited to signal the priority of its opinion: hydroeletity, forests, especially the mineral sector, which, after the growth of the emergency countries and the restructuring of public infrastructure, has experienced various improvements.
In the list styled by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, ram, platin, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamants".
This "great territory is the double of France", it's here, the Quebec.
It's not just here, but it's insighted in us," he insisted, as he wants to highlight a myth of funding.
The Quebec's Property are rooted in its relationship with the North, he highlighted: the golden fever in Abitibi, the injektory na¤, the Baia of James.
"Speak to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatral pause to look at the large map in his shoes.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always rejected, has expressed the Prime Minister during the press conference.
"This is a traditional position held by all governments.
There is a line of border on which there is no long-term agreement and, when the opportunity is present, I will replace that position in the name of the Government," he said.
The rest," considering the climate changes, it needs to revalue the North," he stated by speaking about the north-western shipment, which will be opened for the whole year because of the dilution of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister appreciates that occupation of the territory is a debt.”
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-member of the PQ of Hungava) have already given the way to consult a thirty community.
A interministerial committee presided by Benoit Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) is occupied with a major charge, has started works.
The Prime Minister doesn't exclude a great meeting," not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would affect the rest of the sustainable development principles.
The North Plan will be concerted, and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with the first liberal ministers who predicted it.
"So as the liberals who have predicted us, we know that we are different to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was of altrond one of the teams of the end of the week, which began Thursday with a great cocktail in honor of the fifty-seventh anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to repeat the Centre Beauharnois in Diga Adelard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, the Creator of the Hydro-Quebec, in Lesage who nationalized the hidroeletity, in Bourassa, the Creator of Baia James, our party has always heard forget the future," said Jean Charest.
The printing conference has been sent to another reference, conservator this time, the "Road to North" of John Diefenbaker, the Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project on Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric diet, Charest pointed out that its function would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed his soldiers, wake up applauded.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April, would not have been elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, has dismissed the possibility of launching an autonomous investigation, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It is certainly very implied, especially in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the summit Quebec-New York.
The General Council on the end of the week provided to the liberal capofil a platform of resolutions na©ste, in particular of "aspirations tu» which have been past like oil: the PLQ claims, in particular, the "Quebec Specificity" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that the Quebec names of the members of the Council of the Radio Diffusion and the Canadian Telecommunications and that these last have a right to vote on decisions taken in Quebec.
As regards opposition, the abbosion of the North Plan has been accepted in sceptic manner.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, revolved the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Government of Landry in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, reached to the power in 2003, would not respect the application.
If he had done it," we would have been progressed today," the Marois commented under Jean-Talon's candidate (screet today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated to support the adoption of the North Plan by the Government.
"What we're going to do is that all of this will not be fully perceived as a spectacle," commented Leader Sebastien Proulx, Mario Dumont, in the past today from the vacances.
Letter - A Desonorated Land
It was Vic Toews, the former minister of the "Justity" of Harper's office, to allow you to declare, the last year, that Louise Arbor was a "vergoning" for Canada.
In this way, dishonoring a woman who has inevitably fighted for justice and who deserves all our appreciation is much about the surrounding of the Prime Minister or Stephen Harper.
This is the first thing to a government, which is the only government, among all western countries involved, to have not replaced a citizen in the area of concentration of Guantanamo.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the facts of imputing.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, rejects his word and lets a soldier child fall in unhuman conditions.
The only person who trusts in a parodia of justice to establish the responsibility of the accused.
Remember, in particular, that EECCEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian lawyers call on Omar Khadraffin's refund, which can be subjected to a regular process in Canada.
It is exactly the same government that closes the eyes of before torture: it is very little interested that a young adult is psychologically devastated, perhaps forever, after many years of surrounding.
It is not yet understanding, but we are assisting an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", says that Harper does not stop being obtained and that it sounds so insensitive on his lips.
Here we arrive at the time there is no more morality: it can be maltraited, tortured, arbitraryly imprisoned a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a Governing Boss until today (to see what will be after 14 October...).
Many electors believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has rejected the reputation and dignity of our country.
It's just here the shame, Mr. Toews, in the rejection of all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The orwellian talk of Barrick Gold
In the edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, President of the Canadian Minerary Company Barrick Gold.
Following a orwellian logic, this last states that the largest aurifer company of the world has sported a query for diffusion from six million against three authors and a small editorial house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the Jews are imperfect and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a query for diffamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this substantive difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way of conducting a public debate would lead to the royal royalty whoever is able to support an opposite position to her.
The outcome of the process, the writers and the editor of the book Canadian Nero will have to expendire a cospic sum of money to organize their own own and fight, with decisive weapons, against an exercise of lawyers financed by the taxes practically without the fund of the mineral company.
Moreover, in these learning weapons fighting, the tactic is often the destruction of the agreement in order to impose a regulation, that is the opposite to him, as well as fearing everyone who wants to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public opinion that she should present its vision of facts.
In contrast with what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold works in Canada, the debates are in line with the exchange of opinions and non-mangale.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, documents, and to establish a real and own debate through journals, media, publications and the financing of indirect researchers, which would have been able to make a light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in public opinions and reject the requests and letters to support the authors of the Black Canada.
Maybe Garver could explain how he can ask for a public debate when his depreciation for the same public is clear?
In the world of the President, this word seems to indicate exclusively the pronunciously paid lawyers and not the whole of the Canadians; here is a very stretched vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Canada Nero is first because he refuses the brutal means adopted by the mineral company.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of citizens of opinion exchange, not in the optical of what many feel like a kind of appreciation (seeing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has given to the authors of Canada Nero a ultimatum inciting them to suspend the use of that word...)
Besides the surreal talk of Garver, the shop of Barck Gold sports directly attacks the freedom of university research and the dealing of truth, which is essential in each democracy society.
It rejects the right to quotation of sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis for intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss the issues of the world's most important business, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do it by following scientific standards as the authors of the Black Canada.
He has the right to reply.
Since a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to manage debates and disappointments and to restore conflicts.
The exhaustive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its precepts, it does not look for a transparent debate.
This is going to escape from the university world, as it takes the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments take measures to limit abuse desires.
Operation - Warning for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republican and Democratic
The Bush administration and the Congress Chapels, representatives of the Republic and Democracy Warranty, finally in the 1930s have been joined to a agreement on the largest free-financial plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion dollars, which aims to put a freno to the financial crisis that has taken months on Wall Street, must still be held by the two rooms of the Congress.
It provides, in particular, checks on its effectiveness by the electoral leaders, new mechanisms which guarantee the refund of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses pigmented for payments, as well as a right to inspection on payments payable to the leaders of the protected enterprises.
The American Secretary to the Tesoro, Henry Paulson, the president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative republiced at the table of the treaties, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a trading maraton two days.
"We have made great progress in view of an effective agreement on the sea," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way to protect the population and the American people from the current crisis at Wall Street," explained the Democratic.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, inestimable disappointments and troubles would turn on the daily life of the Americans," said the republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the treaties was marked by concerns regarding the impact of a new failure on investors.
The given time limit corresponded to the opening of the sea, this morning.
Unities later in the Treaty, the two candidates to the American Presidents have been very favourable to the agreement, however, without avoiding expressing their miscontent before the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama is worth adding some provisions to the Agreement, in particular that will allow the owners to maintain their home and the inheritance to payments to the leaders of undertakings covered by the State.
"When the contributors ask to adopt exceptional measures due to the inresponsibility of others, there is nothing to be rejoiced.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote for the plan, his republic adversary, John McCain, answered: "I want to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"When I've read, it's something that we all have to say and that'll let us go forward."
The option of a non-intervent is not acceptable," he said.
The plan of 700 billion is intended to recover with the money of the contributors of the dubble credits, risk and income activity of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crises due to the conclusion of an immobilious bulk that first led to the risk-subsidies (mutuals) crossing, and then extends to other forms of more distributed credit licences (PCAAA) and focuses on the congelation of liquidity and the discharge of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of republics in charge to send the first project of an agreement last week.
It seems to have been exited from that blind vicle since the democrats have accepted that the "toxic" activity of some difficulties companys is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet all, at the Congress, a provision was added to which, if the government had to face losses during the five years to come due to that programme, it could offer new taxes to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides the expenditure of a first amount of 250 billion, which will be able to add 100 billion if the Chairman is required.
The expenditure of 350 billion should be made by a further vote of the Congress.
Instead of its intention, Washington will receive quotas of participation in protected enterprises that will have dividends in the case of profit and that will be able to see when the waters will be calm.
As set out by the plan, the Federal Government will have the possibility of repealing the strategy procedures relating to immobiliary loans and fixing limits to the remuneration and department refunds to the leaders of the involved enterprises.
Since today, the plan teams would like to submit to the vote of the Representative Chamber and to the vote of the Senate Thursday.
Despite all the effort, it is still not sure that it is given the free way to their plan.
In fact, there were several votes against the project yesterday, both at the Republic and Democratic warning.
"Of course, Washington doesn't hear you," he told his electors the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Financial Committee of the Camera.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But we're not sure to benefit the contributors.
Leader of a small group at the Congress called "the Causus of Scetics", the Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation in different ways, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of 日, including three Nobel Prices, have written us to say: We ask the Congress not to take dismissed conclusions and to examine the way to take carefully," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, he was once again attending the test of the world's nature of crisis.
After an energy meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the Governments of the EEC, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French BNS Paribas reported that he would reject the acquisition of his competitor, in full failure after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) for the risk crisis of immobiliary loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 and is part of the twenty largest banks in Europe and ten largest insurers.
"It's not of money," said the Netherlands Ministry of Finances, Wo · Bos, yesterday.
Instead, the influence and voting rights are recovered in the issues of the European Parliament.
It's certainly something that guards and families appreciate now that time is announced uncertain."
In this period, at the other end of Manica, the British Government seems to be able to make another bill for the financial crisis.
According to the English print, the government would carry out the total of the loans currently currently on Bradford and Bringley, which is more than 41 billion dollars (75.5 billion dollars) of immobiliary loans.
Spanish Santander has made known yesterday that you will buy the sugars and the client accounts of the British.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second, after Northern Rock, to take up a nationalization process by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
The wrath of the blue eyes was for a long time his ass in the hand, for others his weak point.
Did he be released from the narcistic speech, the American actor from the ammaliator smile?
Yeah and not.
His discretion, sensitivity and evidence talent would have expelled it from that circle of powerful consacred to true and their sacred monsters.
But what cost!
Paul Newman, missing Thursday, at the age of 83, in his rand of the Connecticut, after a cancer at the pulmone, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the last years.
At least the monumental of Brando, which he liked and of which he was long a sort of d rival on the ́o, more fragile in his own, certainly more fragile, but he also carries the freedom and development of dramatic convictions.
Mystery couples often born magic children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 by German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots, one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble, last quality mark.
Since in him all was an invasive country of the safe made man, the fighter of the war of the Fisheries, fierce in the fight, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic arts in Yale, then the Actor of New York accompanyed, before trionfaring theater, in television and soon to the cinema.
The same military man for civil rights was also the car pilot classified according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, and six symbols, even though part of a couple model since 1958 with the actor Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of a reserved, discrete, imprisoned, allergic to the show-business scandals, which will never be able to wake up the mystery completely.
A honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart tuff for cines, while his great persons people the black memories.
More than a half-year-old American cinema is repeated through its interpretations.
They are confused in the memory of the fascinating cow-boy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that guy is incapable of wanting the focused wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat on the teat that takes place by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Later, we remember it in Mr. Bri · (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep as promised.
Many other Paul Newman have passed to the story.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Lassú, someone loves me, of Robert Wise, a role in James Dean, and renewed after his death, who officially launched Newman in 1956.
That bad sympathic in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best film in 1973.
Love and sale player in Lo Spaccone, a great film of Robert Rossen (1961), The color of the money of Martin Scorsese, which was worth him in 1987 the only oscar on 9 nominations.
That face throughout the years was his.
He's still.
The epochs occur through his path.
Young people know it especially for the Slap Shot- Colpo sucking films of George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, a hockey square on a little orthodox glass.
His fans found it in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, brothers Coen.
The circle was closed with a last role from the Irish Mafia's father in Era my father in 2003.
In contrast with the less leaving degrees of the cinema that quickly left the officer, Newman will remain long in the sales, declaring Hollywood throughout his sphere, festivals and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French cinema, defined it, with a point of ironicity, "a living challenge at underplaying", judged overwhelming his performance.
Profession was not always a -- for the good Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall as a man from heaven.
However, he often prefered the role of the emargined to the young actor: neurotic persons, alcoholized carrying or dispersed, which he expressed by shaking and rebelling with his perfect treasures.
As registered, Newman discovered an unknown dilution of his reality, pudding sensitivity.
Jennifer's first time in 1968 (based on Canadian Margaret Laurence's romance), with Joanne Woodward's wife in the role of the protagonist, tracked a subtilly female trace of melanconia.
He, who made the son of Scott for a overdose, dedicated him the Harry and Son film in 1984, discreet and triste film.
Among the innumerable hooks on Newman yesterday, his big friend and old arms companion Robert Redford (they were recited together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated infinite trial" His presence made my life and this best country."
Generosity and love for life, two big characteristics of the disappeared actor.
On the other hand of a legend car, it is so a great military for civil rights, ecology, Indian cinema, a counterpart of the Hollywoodian derivative.
We've stretched his face on acetic bottles, salts, bishops and other foods, giving it a choice of bad pleasure, although she is born as gag.
The income of those sold were, however, to its Children's Fundation in difficulties.
Newman, rather than add to his myth, choosing to commit to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter that he said "Always and until the end, your father was incrediblely reliant to his good star.
It was a privilege."
And the same privilege was for us to follow the way of an American artist so generous and generous.
Citizens are the model, so, and much more.
What has been produced in the factory factory of Zuschlag & socio?
In short, on 8 October, the audience of the criminal process will be discussed against Janos Zuschlag and societies.
The political man and his partners are reitered of trade frauds in the context of a criminal association that has caused significant damage, and other crimes, including documentation.
According to the Procure, the money obtained from competition bands was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the implementation of activities through factures.
The State and municipal money, in total 65 million flowers, has been completed in the cases of the Fiatal Baloldal Organization, in part in the taxes of some people.
According to the method, known by the inquiry authorities, the money received from competition bands on the basis of factures for inexistent operations and the associations have never fulfilled the commitments taken.
According to the Act, the majority of the factures was fair.
In order to make it, the factures blocks were purchased on the market of Jozsefvaros, but the circles were produced in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on the name of which to issue the factures, it was established between the other during the gita between the hills over the Balaton where Janos Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of this last, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for consumption, on the model of these, the facts were prepared to submit to competition bands, among others, to those of the Minister for Juventure and Sport, the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs and the Budapest Community.
Most of these are the works of István Lados and András ́ri, which, according to our information, has set up in particular the reports necessary to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "traveling studies" was a birdry.
According to two factors issued by Zuschlag and societies in 2003, the restaurant site has emigrated for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egyesuelet Association.
But so many people, as the restaurant states, would not enter all together.
Similarly, the facture and ­ in the state 2002 at the Jobb Jövért Foundation, then called Együtt to Harmadik Evezredert, pull of formal and content errors.
A Pension of Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not record us, however, 130 guests were in the fabric.
But the compilers of full of fantasy factors have exhausted when reported the Pigal Kft., this is also occupied of restaurants, in which accountability - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - were not even the documents on behalf of Jobb Jöv'ért and Hoppa.
Gy ·z · Farkas, the company's administrator, declared to hvg.hu that when he was invited to search and showed the facts, he immediately realized that it was documents.
"The name and the Iva game of our business were in a wrong point."
He added: Besides the formal reasons, it was not even the fact that, according to the fact, hundreds of people were allocated, when they totally have 11 rooms and there are no so many places reading.
In general, the facture was of restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in response.
The factory compilers were not concerned that the Budapest's travel agency from their choice, organized only travels to the outside, so they did soon indicate about the facture with payment in counting travel in Hungary, which was not compatible with the emissions practice of the company's emissions.
Moreover, as shown during the investigation, the facture also included Iva, while the travel activity to countries outside the European Union is Iva.
In addition, the amount of Iva was wrong on the four documents inside the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the foundation of Jobb Jöv日ert, because on the services offered by the company Iva must apply to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the facts, and also the hotel's ability was only printed, while the manufactured factor was written in hand.
Furthermore, the "emittents" destroyed other facts, in the case of a dictate, indicated the activities of the transport of goods on the road, as it is known by the Procure procedure, activities that were not found by the company based originally for advice of investment.
Furthermore, for formal - causes non-compliant factory format, timbro ́o - has been discovered that the factures issued for Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány, of XXI. Šázadi Culturalis Egyesuelet and Biztos Pont are.
The same occurred in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camp of Kunfeherto, whose representatives refused to have issued the facts.
The owners did not even give attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városert Egyesület feeded you, so the curator of the liquidation of the dictator, according to our information, refused to have issued that fact.
They have made facts consciously
Another group of factory issuers is held by those who were conscious of the need to issue fatty factors.
The Esély Budapestert Alapitvány Foundation has issued a facture on request for Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták for the Egypt Foundation in Harmadik Evezedert of almost 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the imputed, according to the act, convinced the director of Collab Kft to issue fitting factors.
In 2003, the Biogate Kft has also been in liquidation with Zuschlag and societies, which has provided factures for a value of approximately 5 million flowers to Jobb Jövért Alapitvány, the association of Atlasz Egyesület and the association of Vorösfeny Family Egyesület, behind which there was no real economic activity.
No money movement because the prepared factures were then broken, but the associations forgot to put this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of faxing digits belong to those who are connected to the imputated.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorised to recover the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft, with a seat in Budapest but not repeated there, which is occupied with fuel and vehicles.
The dictator issued several facts in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of information means, for a value of approximately 18 million flowers.
According to the data of the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas has purchased these factures since 14 September 2005.
The Director-General of this Dictionary was a routine to which Ivan Kubatov would transfer the documents on the dictator between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, has been released factures in the name of the company to the dictators Atlasz, Hoppa and Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány and the counterpart has been taken by him.
On the request of Ivan Kubatov Roman murders found the Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, however, no of the dictators was operative, because they had not received work according to the input.
However, businesses have become useful because, on request of the lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the funding documents of the companies, on behalf of the dictators, factors were issued to associations related to Zuschlag: to Atlantic and Y-generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has issued to various entities 15 factors for a total value of 14,2 million flowers.
The request considers that Kubatov has taken 10% of the amounts indicated on the factures and Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to educate fitting factors made for Biztos Pont competition band.
Y-generation and Šövetség in Modern Magyarorzhágért in January 2006 have presented a band for the public use entity of the Socialist Party, Tásics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They also wined 500,000 test flowers but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the band.
So that it would not come to the gala, they presented to the TMA five fitting factors received by Works Team Kft.
These facts were found during the surquisition of the office of Arrd Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
A part of the charged ones, as they already have been in search, will probably refer to the advancement of the production of factors.
However, the most interesting thing may be if the inputed number one, Janos Zuschlag, would decide to highlight the speed over everything.
His confession has not been very detailed, and even though she has promised to speak more times in extent, she has not yet done it.
We need to see if it is in his interest, it may also be that socialists have taken agreements with Zusi, which, instead of a 50 million flowers recovery, would be willing to make the spiral cab.
Zuschlag could also be offended since his requests for attachment to his conditions of prison, namely the concession of home arrests, have not yet been found.
While the authors of non-recoverable and caused trade crimes can freely be able to wait at home at the end of the procedure against them, which is not granted to him.
Psychology of the licitation in excess: why do you cost more money?
In these cases, the acquisitors are intended to expenditure more, to overevaluate the goods.
Neurologists and economicists of the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this known and apparently irracial behaviour.
According to their study on the Science magazine, men don't want to stay back in a garage like the eBay's rate, so they are able to pay a higher price.
The research tried to track the nervous scheme of this "part" at the level of the nervous system through these experimental asses.
A group of volunteers has been fighting, the other group of volunteers has participated in a stage while with the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) have examined the active areas of the brain of those who participate in the experience.
In both games, the participants could win money, but in the range of asta, in which the essential element is to request more than the other, the body stretched under the brain cortex is intensely in function when it loses it.
This brain area, besides other functions, is a role in the "auto-gratification mechanism" of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the price raise is explained by scanning the vialy reaction of the shooted body.
In order to support their theory, the research group's economicists have conducted a financial investigation.
In this investigation, three groups have claimed against a partner in various conditions.
The control group referred to as the actual value of the product concerned and they did their point.
To another group, they have promised that in the case of winning, they will receive another premium of $15.
Instead, the third group would have received 15 dollars before the end, but the members of the group would have the money in case of loss.
The difference between the two groups consisted of the fact that for one of them the winning was underlined, and for another loss.
Checking the neurological hypothesis, the members of the group who were "confronted with loss" were willing to make higher points of the control group or "victor".
"These results are not deducible by any of the economic theories existingly.
In fact, these too explained the phenomenon to the asts with the joy of winning and avoiding the risk.
Only the methods for the creation of the neurological image have helped to restore the contradiction between the two theories, so that we are joined to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Economy Facility of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you contact your doctor?
Nearly half billion people in the world suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, but in Hungary, among the first causes of death, chronic hepatic diseases are reduced.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis diseases increases to hundreds of miles, of which only 7000 are cured: the reason is that many diseases don't know that they are counted.
The hepatitis definition is the collective name of counterfeit hepatic diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and irritation, but their patogen agents and the caused diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are distributed in two main forms according to the patogen agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infection feed), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruss and organic liquids (sperma, vaginal losses, saliva).
For those traveling is useful to vaccinate against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of the hepatitis A appear two-three weeks after the consumption of infection food, accompanied by general disease, weakness, domain pain and hurt.
After sharing the skin and the white of the eyes, the fats become clear and the dark urin, the healing occurs within two-three weeks.
A million people die every year for the hepatitis B, the severe variety of disease, which causes tumors to fegate and hepatic cirrose.
The main reason is, according to the estimates, that only one person on ten receives a pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not cured can cause hepatic cirrrhosis and tumors to fegate.
Most of the persons affect not know that they have contracted the disease because patogen agents in a way subdole the hepatic cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
So it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical analysis.
This disease is much more frequent than the media in three groups: who had a blood transfusion before 1991, toxicodes and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people affected by the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
As a routine study also shows the disease, the pen is worth referring to the family doctor when any unknown symptom of origin is not known.
In time recognized disease is curable, the virus can be removed from −mo, so stops the infective power and can be prevented by training of tumors.
On 30 September, the World Day of Hepatitis is organized for the first time in 2004 throughout the world by disease associations.
The goal is to call attention on viral chronic hepatitis, the causes of its development and the pre-respect of the disease.
Who believe in God feels less painful?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith works as a species of analgesic that made the death of the Catholic martyrs more sustainable.
The scientists of the University of Oxford have experienced an interesting experience, considering how the faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph has communicated.
In the surveying area, a electroshock of 12 Catholic believers and similar atei was made, while everyone watched a famous depth of Mary's virgin.
Based on the results, the Catholic believers were rejecting much of the pain.
Thanks to the explosive technology of human brain, the Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain’s control of pain.
The test is the first of a series of research in which the academics also participate in scientists, philosophy and theologists of the University.
The test has performed exactly this way: a tool that emits downloads and pass the electroshock has been linked to the left hand of the experienced subject.
Researchers asked the participants to focus on two divisions, the virgin Mary diminished in the XVII century by Sassoferrat and La Dama with the rubber of Vinci diminished in the XV century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the virgin Mary was originating in a kind of religious state among the believers, while the frame was chosen because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it was a quiet effect.
The subjects of the experience have passed half hour before the scanner MRI and in this time ago have received 20 electroshock in four consecutive series, while they observed or diminished to religious or other subjects.
The Catholics mentioned that the vision of the virgin Mary made them feel "secure", as if "one's cared" of them and "they were quiet and perished from peace."
Looking at the religious theme, they realized 12% in less pain than when they had the work of work before them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part of himself in the test, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image from the strong effect also for the atei, but it is necessary to find the appropriate image.
"D we need to look for a picture to which they nut very positive feelings, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." Wright added.
After the best results, the question remains only if it is presented to the credentials the depth of a madonna or another calibrator, what could have effect on the control of the pain?
The vision of a girl Mary of quality would bring better results?
You're what you're saying about yourself
On the day of the tenth year, Google can say to find himself both in the people's boxes and in the heavens above their tests; he knows where they have passed the vacances, how they frequently walk and what they are interested in.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the dictators, is not enough yet.
Instead, what happens to the scettics that make a comparison with the orwellian incub, they do not see exactly the web substance 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt declared to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect more personal data than their users and this is necessary to reach the original goal of the founders of Google that was: "We insert all the information in a system!".
According to the Google Director interviewed the dictate, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of managing all information.
At the question, what will happen between five years, Schmidt answered: He would like Google to answer questions such as "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the right job for me?", but the software doesn't mean to answer questions appearingly simple because they don't know enough of users.
Not all internal people know that during their Internet research, the search words are recorded exactly, from which IP index are searched and on which page the interested ones are stopped after the search.
By means of the Personalized Search started two years ago, users such as can memorize their navigation story, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, and then they will generate results of much better measure; on this same logic, recommendations are based on which the system offers us products and services based on our declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data are used against me if they look at what I'm busy? - the concerns of Google data monopol users ask.
In most cases, the conflicts of internal people are caused by the fearful temptation of the potential power represented by the dictator , not by the sense of , for the fear of the punishment, for the desire of freedom or even for the rebellion to the power.
One fact, however, is confirmed and that all search expressions are not only registered but in motivated cases can also be granted to thirds, in such cases, in the cases of none of the personal rights of the internal.
The most latest example of this in recent times may have been the coordinated action against Brazil pedofils, in which Google has transferred to Brazilian government the information that has made possible to identify pedofils from the Google Orkut page.
Instead, those concerned about personal rights have been suspicious of highlighting to May when the dictate - in accordance with the EFF legal protection association - has successfully demonstrated the truth in the court against the FBI: it can not be costed by Google with no point of training to provide any requested information secretly from the FBI.
(In the same time, the Federal Government has succeeded at approximately 50,000 websites and thousand research expressions obtained in relation to the confirmation of the child protection law approved years ago, but it has not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and key words that result in two months.)
Thus, Google's judgment is very contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data sphers Google because they believe that this is their intimate sfera and their private life starting using their services, and they arise with the spectacular rebellion to the multinaes that spend for the conservation image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of appeals, activists and users of the computer appeared in many countries see in them the future generation of the big digits, the "cool corporation", contrary to their rival, Microsoft liquidated as a conquist of the world because of Windows, as both fighting for the same objective.
This can happen because Google does not ask his users a identifier code, does not ask money for its services, the source code always being updated and the program package is much more accessible, young and cool of the official practice of the software class.
But it can also happen because geekses see exactly the problem relationship between personal rights and Internet, which really involves one of the key words often repeatedly in recent years, the Web 2.0.
The web 2.0 does not speak of otherwise than of the operation, to leave intentionally tracks behind us and to use the communications channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: show us ourselves.
A medium young man can create profiles in more Community pages from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical enjoyments, all of them can include them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, also write blogs on which the most recent photo gallerys of Flickr or Picasa are automatically stored.
Instead, we read of many examples from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos scattered at the morning from the common round of friends, is easy to know with who has passed the night with her dead boy or a dictate can leave her deceit because he has written a sincere opinion on the company's top: a thing is safe, the concept of private life now has been completely recognised.
Whoever lives in a online life makes a way to show himself and so we can form the tesis that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
Whoever wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google monopolie can do it (for example, by starting with Scroogle using the Google search system but that at the same time does not leave tracks voluntaryly).
There are no few people who do not register on Community pages to be found, Google online applications, from the processing of texts to image management and news collection, you can handle alternative versions that are not linked to large server parks and which do not compose our best profile until existing.
The public opinion expects not so much in secret the time when Google will get out of the arts.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars values more than IBM (140 billion dollars), the Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the public spaces AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of the public agencies, the record-time-introduction services cause great diseases not only to Microsoft but also to many software developments.
However, critical observers at all of this find warning points: the company's top, for example, has completely rejected the protest of the desti after doubled the right of the company asylum, has seen too costly the repeated restaurant to enjoy the day of the Chinese regime, but this decreases before the fact that in 2006 Google has declined the chinese government and, in the sense of their agreement, it will filter all the results that offend the good pleasure and interests of the Chinese regime.
A internal rule of the dictate seems to be not to publish a new service in the past but only when it is useable, one thing is sure, however, that the predictable problems of the next months and years will remove the world in one point: while some believe that the project of scannering and employment of books and revised Google will make proportions such as the dictator will soon be before the Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, in this way we can create a health profile with our references, medicals and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database data can offer good material to the next generation of fantastic writers, the Scroogled report of the Family Cory Doctorow describes the future with orwellians, in which a man with the data of Google can be closed in a warning way.
Two minors helped Ozd's double killing to lose tracks
The police asked two minors about Ozd's duplicate murder, which was fundamentally suspicious of his help to lose crime tracks - said on Tuesday the Portfolio of the Police Question of Borsod region.
Young people have the crime to them imposed, currently they are favorable.
The two minors, two girls, according to MTI information, are free.
The favour is punishable until 5 years of recruitment.
The suspect of the duplicate murder of Osd, a 23-year-old man of the place, was placed in prevention.
It's suspected of a premedissed multiumicide made for profit.
From the investigation, the 20-year-old young man had a great debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, for this reason, last Thursday, he attached his creditor with a liar in a song of Osd, where he and his 9 - year - old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit crime, a signal is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the place.
Police is investigating the weapons and conditions of use with the involvement of a expert.
The Borsa in Varsavia has made a offer for the acquisition of the Borsa de Praga
The Borsa Values of Varsavia offered 200 million euros, approximately 5 billion Czech Corn, for the acquisition of 100% of the list of actions of the Borsa Values of Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Borsa in Varsavia, confirmed the advanced offer from the Polands, despite the Czechs had excluded in predicting the Borsa in Varsavia as possible from the Prague Borsa.
The reason for exclusion is that the Borsa of Varsavia is owned by the state.
The 99% of the actions are in hand in the Poland state that intends to sell within a few months more than 60% of its titles.
The Czech Financial Day E15 states that the offer of Poland represents the highest until the advanced number for the Borsa of Prague.
According to the Czech print, they have already presented a offer by the Borsa of Vienna, the Transatlantic Borsa Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Borsa and the German Borsa.
Peter Koblic, director of the Borsa Values of Prague, stated last week that the Borsa of Varsavia would be the worst owner of all interested people and did not exclude that this could lead to the closure of the Borsa of Prague in future.
Market experts appreciate the value of the Borsa of Prague in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the Actionist Agreement, nearly 90% of the licences would be sold.
The most owner of the Borsa di Praga is Patria Finance with a quota of almost 25%, followed by Banca Česka Sporítelna by 14,7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5%
The economic crisis from the view of the European Journals
The main European journals in their comments on Thursdays dedicated to the internal economic crisis are already talking about "A second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has occurred thanks to the American President - > The Republic - which has not been able to compact its party behind a quickly rebounded law, which is to replace a disappeared situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more precise to talk about one second 11 September.
Also a part of Madrid's printing sees the spiral cab in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political guide has cast the world's horn on the barter.
It always grows more dangerous in the American financial system, and then the world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the vote of the congress, there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means for the management of the crisis.
The world is suspended in air, just when the most transformation of the capitalism history is performed.
It is no longer possible to leave the threat - accommodate the Days-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a saving cimbell to barcollant financial situations and with the money of the contributors can save them from the failure.
But if more banks are always crossing as in a dominant effect, they will not be sufficient or financial means or new solutions in the past.
For a long time, Member States of the European Union need to overcome their egoism and control over seas-small financial seas.
Only Monday, the unbalanced financial institutions have received more than 100 billion euros - remember the Der Standard wines, which seems to be more real than the European contributors, like the Americans, will have to put their hands on their portfolio to replace the crisis.
The EU has not yet been very concerned about the crisis that has passed through the old continent as a tsunami.
"Salvators" should not straighten the 100 billion euros, but it would be better if they determined where the contributions should be touched in order to prevent greater damage.
The smart car imitates the flight of the calabrone
What could be the best method to develop anticollition technology if you don't imitate the sensors of obstacles that are in nature?
For example, those of the birds.
In the enormous project presented to the CEATEC in Japan, the calabrons have given the initial strategy of Nissan engineers how to build the next generation of anti-collection systems.
In relation to the University of Tokio la Nissan built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a provised robotic mini-motor of apy properties, in order to create a system that can scan all sessions.
Flighting the air forms a own oval personal space that really looks very like our protective sculpture - explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR technology and research and development sector.
Important is the role of the ape view, a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers have reached the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the ape view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles to two meters of distance within a 180-degrees radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the board microheader that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid the existence.
In a fraction of the robot, it perceives the stack and then, imitating the moves of the appeal, changes straight by turning the rounds of the measure necessary to avoid the incident.
This manual of avoidance, in a way different from the system, is running in a way of all instinct.
"If it wasn't so the robot's car couldn't respond quickly to avoid the sessions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory Mobility and the robot project.
It must be an instinct and immediate response because this technology corresponds to the harmful and more internal strategy of protective sculpture, within which the employment is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what it does to avoid the other eggs.
This process must be carried out in a look-up.
But in contrast to the apps, the deviation cannot go to the higher or lower or in diagonal, it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of the streets' stersibility.
Instead of the infinite opportunities for the apes to scan the other apes, robots, as the possibility to be available, can rotate on themselves, accelerate and relax.
BR23C is feeded by bacteria to litio polymers, reader and higher energy density, which means that their duration is greater than those of litio ioni.
According to Andoh, it is important that the importance of the intelligent reaction, not the processing of data, or even less the ability to save them.
This robot must develop some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on manual data, so it uses only a few decades of Kb.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for immediate avoidance of Nissan, which, as provided for in Nissan, can be installed on series vehicles within 10 years.
A further application possibility can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that prevents the obstacles on the road leading to destination.
They also found the name of the most costly child
The written version of the economic safeguard law has been adjusted from $700 billion for the acquisition of adequate credits, to be applied in more parts.
In the first event, half of the sum is costed.
In the new processed agreements until midnight, according to the east coast hour, the leaders of the congress decided the 700 billion dollar safeguard plan after a debat that was last-day - Referenced the King.
We have composed the series of advances - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American Representative Chamber, which was only to put the agreement on the paper.
Both candidates at the presidentship, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the commitment of the plan.
The Minister of Tesoro Henry Paulson, talking about the result of the compromise, stated that the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian sea at the 8th hour of Washington (the 2th Monday night according to the time of Central Europe), but it did not bring a large growth of the boss.
On Monday, the Representative Chamber will vote for the first time for the 2008 Economic Stabilisation Law on the Programme, after it will touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke Sabbath night with Pelosi, and then joyed the news of the agreement at the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress reached tonight and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial sea and defense it - stated Tony Fratto portavoce of the White House.
The programme, however, is different from the original proposal of Bush's administration, which provided that the 700 billion dollars would have been spent all for the acquisition of licences with adequate credit.
Now as the first of the Congress, it will be possible to expendirate the half of the $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of the Congress, with these the Ministry of the Teasure will purchase tickets with adequate credits, of the rest of $100 billion will be decided by the President.
A special college will control the programme in which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The cost of the other half of 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
In the meaning of the law, the Ministry of the Treasury may apply a combinated tactic: it can purchase credits, hypotheches and titles at the same time with hypotheches and other types of "adventure" credits.
The acquisition may occur through asses and directly - have announced the Minister's competent authorities.
The legal standard makes it possible for the interested persons to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means concerned, for which companies will pay a suitable price for possible damage.
Henrz Paulson said: The law gives the necessary means to 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which are the acquisition of wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of a large financial institution.
We will do all the needs to make us ready to introduce the signed law - he added.
Instead, the directors of the banks in crisis and in expectation of the state's age think that the government will limit their goods, defined by the oltreocean slang, as gold paracadute.
The limitations of payments will only be in some cases, and the limitations also depend on how the Ministry of the Treasury will offer a.
The limitation means that if the Ministry purchases in the framework of a steel, it will offer a overflow on the gold parachute, if they will not send the decade director to pension.
At the time of the direct acquisition of credits supplied by the Government will be aggressively involved to ensure that the money of the directors are not exhausted.
This should be added that the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is valid only for new people to enhance the participation of the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal restriction on the refund of general administrators - has commented on the implementation of Democracy Barney Frank President of the Committee on Financial Services of the Representative Chamber.
Moreover, it has the right to adjust a quota of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of contributors, since, at the end, they can also gain us if it, and with it the saved ability, will remain in pieces.
The legislative proposal includes that the Chairman must present the Congress a proposal that provides how to refund the contributors the provisional losses resulting from the financial sector.
Of course, both parties have been those who have expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens asked us, not to defend the dollars of the contributors - said the Republican Member of the California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the procedures have been taken by the same ones that are in the Wall Street Cross.

Mrs. Nancy Pelosi on Sunday said that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the legislative proposal on Monday.
Printing race in the German language world
The right pool is intaked, only within the pool the electors became more conscious - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Baviera.
Hader's party is ready to govern Austria to prevent red-swarm coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the edition of the German left magazine, in the article The Revolution of Baviera divorces their parents analyses the causes of CSU's disappeared dramatics.
According to the known politology, the CSU's erosion has already been started a long time before the trist couple Beckstein-Huber came into charge.
Christian-social people have re-moderned the Baviera for decades and just now these modern citizens are away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all the Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merker.
The disappointment was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that has been executable exactly ten years ago: it has been completed the inexcusable egemonia of a State party.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was precipient to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% surface since the 50%.
This has been repeated three years ago to Bundestag's elections in 2005 still in the period of so many men Stoiber.
This is the cause of modernization that results in the region, which divorces parents.
The sociologists have pronounced it 40 years ago, but they have missed a lot of time, but the secularization, the results of education, the insect of the East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the faithfulness of the electors to the CSU.
The modernization is equal to the increase in the possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The right pool is intaked, only within the pool of the electors have become more conscious, critical, obtained.
It is also amazing that in the last weeks, the CSU has been removed from the classic Bulgarian groups: free professionals, artigians, diplomats and laureats.
The support to the CSU has fallen under 40%.
The press (depresse.com)
The Conservative Day comes "Who with?" in the article "The Presidents of the Parties are blocked in coalition issues" it takes care of the confused Austrian internal political situation created after elections.
The SPÖ intends to handle the ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal business.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Green still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been made, now it turns everything back to coalition; in the debate after TV publics the leaders of the party have made it possible to see the cards.
Werner Faymann President of the SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to handle ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that interaction between the two parties, in some regions and social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left the question open if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, president of ÖVP, as a cancer.
As he said, the course of Schüssel-Molter was in any case rejected.
The repeat of this direction shall not be considered.
Molterer has reacted hardly to red offers.
As it stated, the operation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to enter the Internal Affairs of ÖVP.
If its party chooses the opposite or enters the coalition is still one thing open in the party, the issues shall be discussed in any case within the OECD.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ has repeatedly opened in all directions.
"In order to prevent the red-neur coalition, we are ready to handle us the ability to rule," said Haider.
Jaróka: We need to break the visible circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summary for the Parents is started, organized this year by France with the European Union's turnover presidency.
Livia Jaróka, Fidesz of the European Popular Party, in the message addressed to the full as the main rapporteur of the Congress, called the attention to school segregation because it is the seriousest legal violation that makes the children of Rom and to join the most serious stacle for their statement.
Xavier Bertrand French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner Vladimir Špidlae for employment, social and equal opportunities have opened the conference at the maximum level.
There were governments, European social partners and representatives of the largest European civil organizations and rights in the field of equal opportunities.
Jaróka, according to the printing office of the Fidesz Group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the assumptions, that the romes are exrome from the work market first because of their low schooling.
"The majority of the youth roms have no medium-level studies and as a result of the elementary education of bad quality only a number of irrisories of ↓ can reach a higher study title."
Jaróka also highlighted, as human right, the key role of education in the value of human rights.
Investing in the education of the children of Rome may mean strengthening the EU Member States' .
According to the Member State, it is necessary to make these links cognitive in the larger area between the roms and the non-romas.
In fact, as long as the school begins a room, its opportunities to become a productive member of the labour market; by the taxes paid for income and consumption, they contribute to the national budget.
"The European citizenship rights of the Romans must ensure their right to quality education and elimination of low-level and separate schools" stressed Livia Jaróka.
According to the lawyer, the EU's objective and action union is necessary to accelerate school desegregation processes, and therefore it is important that the right respect of existing and designed antidiscrimination directives is essential.
"The visible circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, it must give children the opportunities given by the Democratic Space so that they may contribute as citizens in the future of Europe," asked Jaróka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Part Options" to ensure for all, the purpose of the European Summary for Parents organized each year, from Berlin's meeting last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of antidiscrimination and equal opportunities fixed at State and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
On the end of October, you will decide the sort of Huber-Beckstein's insult couple.
Despite the wrong electoral disappearance, the tests have not yet fallen, at the tops of the Bavarese CSU was the debate on personal issues at the time.
The President of the Party of Erwin Huber and the Regional Governor Günther Beckstein are still at their place, the question is until the time of mercy.
The lucky of the Tandem that has passed a disaster loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party in the last week of October.
The two very critical politicians have noticed in any case that they are not attached with all forces to the stage.
They so tried to murmure the wrath of the parliamentary group and the foundation that one day after the "Bavarian tons" they had expressed personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under Edmund Stoiber's leadership, then, at the chariot of his car, the Christian-social Union received 60.7%, now after the state's status against Stoiber have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Baviera, which gives 18% of the German GDP.
Although conservators always count in the southern region of importance for Hungarian, in the future will be costed in any way to coalize.
The first sign of the reorganization within the party, the President and Federal Minister of the Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered as possible inheritance of Huber, has a place in the stretched exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Liberian Electors who exhibit the right values for an eventual government coalition in Monaco in Baviera.
For a strange guard of destination in the list of Liberian Electors, the Gabriel Pauli legislation, whose attitude against Stoiber was used as a chance of fighting by the couple Huber-Beckstein to then treat the woman without regard to great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their own forces to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
In the meantime, the former regional and ex-president of the CSU defined on 28 September the worst day of its political car.
Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU policies have interpreted the disappointment as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be canceled after the elections of the Bundestag fixed for September 2009 if the CSU will not be repeated with common forces which has played a determining role in the victory in 2005.
According to Merkel, who doesn't hide the delusion for the fashion, the loss of the CSU's land will not be negatively affected on the big Berlin coalition.
What is certainly related: it will not be easy to manage the hurt CSU, but the crisis of social democrats still persists.
The SPD has reached its lower result since 1946 in Baviera with 18,6%.
Opposition of Lukehenko: 110-0
No representative of the opposition has entered into the Belarus Parliament after the elections of Sunday.
According to Russian observators, it is the sign of the welfare and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe (OSCE), but it is explained with the brochures made in the context of votes.
The OSCE, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has no elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million inhabitants is in opposition for more than one decade, before the elections of yesterday the opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) hoped that Lukehenko, with the fourth mandate renewed for the last time after the amendment to the elections of 2006 held in discussion circumstances, "conceded" a seat in Parliament to representatives of opposition.
The ODS has so refused to an evaluated preview booking.
Following the expectations of the opposition, Belarus, more economically than Russian, who requested a credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gases, has allowed the Russians to give the gases in possession of Belarus through the country to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other higher rango politicians cannot enter into the white-democratic political situation.
It refers to a distance that the OSCE, by evaluating the electoral campaign, has set the accent on positive movements and not on the lack of, such as the depth to be presented for a third of the candidates of the opposition.
However, the early Monday report of the OSCE also criticized the campaign, during which the candidates of the current opposition could not appear on the print, and in particular that the opposition could not be presented to the votes account.
Despite this opposition, a improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also available to a small comparison with Moscow by continuing to refusing the deal of the South Ossezia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which the Belarus is a federal state, considers the two countries a month ago.
We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and EU has started - has declared to our journal Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the opposition of elections in 2006, it is expected that it remains, despite that "the power had been afraid to make a single opposition to a Parliament without weight."
The opposition does not provide protests for the results but proves much to bring the electors the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course, we have a lot of problems, d, we must print the opposition journals in Russia, for the distribution of local authorities is difficult, but I also see that more people support the change, including the elders, said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that even the officially helped citizens, the pensioners, considers appropriate the regime of Lukashenko that considers its main results the creation of social security.
As a result of the debt of the country and the increase in economic deficit, it is only a question of time that the disgregation of social security "which remembers the sepulchral silence" - Milinkevich considers.
In contrast with the opposition policy, the Russian observers have judged the elections.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Communities of the Indian States has declared to the Russian printing agency RIA News: "The men believe not in words but in facts," so the lack of opposition is not other than the evidence of maturity of the Belarus electors.
Brunetta: "From now and before the work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were doors round for the entrance and output of the depths.
But since today, it takes this new measure against the furbs, against those who are tired and then he's going to drink a coffee at the bar at work time.
The news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council's President Mauro Masi.
"The round doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more previews and more services" means the Minister.
"Now it opens a new season of transparency and transparency.
This is reform," Brunetta still states.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidentship of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of touring gates is also important from symbolic viewpoint."
There were no resistenties from the deputy, assured the Secretary-General: "It was a process shared by the workers and the workshop of all."
I mean, there's no more coating in work time; no more coffee and coffee.
The word of Brunetta, which suggests, smileing, "a good cappu at the 7th morning is a holy hand."
During a conference to the Superior School of Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister recognises that "in three months the deficiencies for public diseases have been reduced by 50%, which means more than 600,000 people in work in one year."
And adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more
Italian, "thes are the salarial dynamics - explains the Minister - in the last 8-10 years have been doubled to the private sector and well above the inflation rates."
Thus, thousands of public holdings have been united to comply with the rules of Brunetta decree by joining the resource supported by Codacons.
"In addition to the Ministry of the Public Function today, the numbers about the smallest ascension of work for disease - writes the association of consumers - the people of the 'operous fannullons' are continued to grow.
For thousands of people in Italy are the right and productive public administration who have joined themselves to declare war to the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will consist of the exclusion of additional economic treatments for diseases due to service; the extension of the timely stages of the worker's reperiability, within which control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Work incidences, Napolitan: " crucial prevention"
Each day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents, 3 people die, and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white dead was about ↓00.
Numbers that testify the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost the duplicate of deaths in respect of murderers.
In order to call on the attention of instances, social forces and means of information on this dramatic issue, Anmil today celebrates the 58th day in all provinces of Italy for the victims of accidents on the work, which is set out in the second Sunday of October.
"The concernful data broadcast by Anmil and the same chronic tragics of these days confirms how crucial is the question of the prevention of work," states the President of the Republic of Georgia Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the mutilated and invalid work, Peter Mercanda.
The head of the State expresses its "life appreciation for the continuous associative commitment for the prevention of jobs, the protection of unfortunate workers, the assistance of victims' families and public opinions".
"It is, of course, a wrathed 'may', sincerely divided, before tragedies that, for their size, arise the clamor of the media and the involvement of the public opinion, but the daily reality repeat us dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamic."
Napolitan doesn't hide that " there is absolutely a resource problem: it is determined to invest in training and information.
In particular, many initiatives promoted in school for more direct consciousness by young people who are in the work world.
It is necessary to maintain the attention to the phenomena, not to delay in the light of its social seriousness, to apply and improve the legislational rules.
The President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has underlined "as the phenomenon of the white dead is a absolute social emergency, which distorts the conscience of each of us and makes all the instances a decision to make urgently end."
"The data on accidents on the work seems to signal a lightly positive movement, but this does not take the number of white dead still impressionate," commented the President of Anmil Peter Mercanda.
"We wouldn't want that this "before the top" translated in less attention, because it's exactly when the attention is drawn out that explodes the tragedy.
"We believe that at general level it is still too little to contrary the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiply actions.
I'm needed to, in our judgment, - he underlined Mercande® - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"There is a further effort - he added - as regards the communication and employment of the public opinion.
But, in particular, it needs a greater sense of deepness from the employees against a phenomena that represents a social emergency."
Moreover, Mercande ́ declared "the progressive deterioration of the lives of indemnitarian protection for the victims of the work" and the "deficiency of assistance to which the system is spending in the last years".
"The objective is, therefore, to restore the guarantee to the worker - he added - because the happiness of unfortunate persons should not depend on spontaneousism or elargy once by the legislator."
Mp3 players under, risk the audience
Listen to high-volume music for a long time period using mobile musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent audience lesions.
This is how the European Commission refers to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health Health and Recently identified (Cssseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - you read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portal musical devices weekly for more than one hour a day holding the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of auditive disobedience."
"I worry about the fact that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile musical devices and mobile cell phones with lives can unconsciously hurt their hearing in a non-reparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific reperts - continues the Ue - there is a clear risk and d we need to respond quickly.
What is most important, d we need to make consumers and make these public domain information.
D We also need to review the existing control systems, in view of this scientific opinion, to make it completely effective and to maintain the new technology."
Brussels had requested the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, since the great use of mobile musical equipment and the increase of the number of young ones exposed to the voice of origin.
"The scientists - concludes the executive Ue - confirming that there is a reason for concern and the European Commission will now examine the Member States and the interested parties how measures may be taken to better protect children and adolescents from the exhibition of the voice from mobile musical apparatus and adequate equipment."
Currently, there is already a European security standard that limits 100 dB the sound level of mobile musical equipment, but it increases concerns about the auditive damage that can result from a excessive exhibition to such sound sources.
These damage can be limited very much by means of solutions such as reduction of lives and the duration of exposure to the voice.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue states that the users of mobile musical equipment if they listen to a high volume (more than 89 decibel) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limits for the maximum volume on the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of audience after a period of 5 years.
This would be about 5-10% of the users of these equipment and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in Ue.
Rome, Germany guides the Commission for the future of capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, the sums will be taken.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the works of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which has been located this morning in his new seat behind the Termes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will set up the guidelines for Rome.
The Joint and the Community Council will have an analysis and projects once they are closed in March, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official disease" of the Campidoglio and its office Gianni German.
"The Commission is absolutely indispensable, and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - it must subline Germany - it will have to provide proposals for a idea of the development of Rome, of which political decisions, remaining the Joint and the Community Council, will then be able to be used.
There is no overcome of roles but only the will to have a place where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, he will finish his work and then he will lose it, because this experience must have a precise time term.
A© - announce the office - we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of capital Rome."
To whom the Commission is unusual, since its opinions will not be binding, the German answers: "All depends on the work that will be able to make the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be, as in France with the Commission of Attali and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be adequate.
Too often the policy is deceived on the management of the daily and on the events that sometimes occur.
In contrast, we want to look longer and far, in a deeper perspective, working seriously at the development of Rome and his future."
In addition, the Office of Rome has to punish that "This Commission is not an unusual entity or a carrozone: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best ability to express the capital."
In fact, for Germany, "the design of a strategic, not closed or immobile reference must be made to our city to make a level-shot, which he absolutely needed, thinking with a single spirit in his future."
A future that, precisely the Office of Rome, "no will be limited to the only current communal borders but will look well above" not only in the optic of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but also in view of the role that Rome can and must be held as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first president of the United States.
He wrote a known American politician that has to pass through India: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, decreased the United States and had reports (as today from a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
They increase the attacks against Obama just while the date of elections comes near.
A Miami lady wrote on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great toast face: he thinks he will win the highest charge of a nation who had in both two governmenters and five black senators!"
In fact, they are attacks that don't say much; they are clearly appeals of racial nature and they do not answer the question of the electors: will be a good president? But there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good department.
In this case, there are some who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper of Mississippi, in the south visits of the United States, wrote a editorial: once in the cabin to vote we know well who will give his vote to the American patriot.
It's outside one side of the American mentality held covered up to the last.
"Tell what you want, then we'll think where to put the cross, if on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swore: if you have to win Obama, we'll go out of America.
This has never been said before now, which seems almost sure the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the democratic weapon is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: What were the errors made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to the seat.
In Iraq, there are 4500 soldiers who have made life and the Americans have not been designed to make the valleys.
Iraq for the majority was the weak point of Bush.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a great job to perform.
Use, the economic trail is also feeling about journalists: in the journals is time of shoes. And many don't give the Internet, "eva" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been interplyed by 日W Research Center on the status of their professional and mental control in the future.
Well, today the journalists are almost all pessimists on their future.
However, newsmen did not openly declare that they felt less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as one time.
The problem for American journalists is the money, the money.
The crisis in 2008 for these journalists is a devastated economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the rates made in newsroom, in the room where the editors work to set the journals are a big problem.
It is a problem that will be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if you don't want the tradition of journalism as the large public intends to repicculate substantially.
A clear but complete pessimism is today the American journalist.
You are on ten newspapermen and executive elders are convinced that the journalist at level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest editorial houses are opened to the Internet, for many views such as the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn is increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that "do something good" for their journalism.
The largest space today in the American journalism is among those who lead newsrooms - that is directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of the executives at a level are sure that their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this has to do with the "work security".
Executives who think of the job in about 3 years are 47% at a level.
For the reporters' staff is going to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (and our editors, ndr) in America is always at the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a great nation such as Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journals, newspapers, radio, television and Internet workers often offer what they want and become a question of "take it or leave it", to take or leave it.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can also win $10,000 per month, besides the pension and payment of the insurance.
For wounds, then, the reasoning makes it complicated: every day after the first year, even after the third to come to 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, for their approval, are often "smalled" for the year.
It's all the climate issue.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROMA, DANILO COPPOL TO GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second penal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse the insurance of the Immobiliarist Danilo Coppola who had asked to marry his city, Grottaferrata, to a residence in Rome.
Coppola is investigated in the context of the investigation on the counterpart of the Unipol-Bnl scale.
During the last week, the process has been charged by the householders who have been transformed in the obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the immobiliarist could travel from the city of province to a home in the capital.
However, according to the Court of Justice, these movements (which the pm has expressed) would allow him to influence his company and of the evidence that it is.
Elites in danger
The phenomenon has already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the Representative Room against the 700 billion dollars of the salvation plan from the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and it is more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the §.
The New York Times of yesterday confirms that the current crisis is splitting the Republic Party, always more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to the federal and business instructions, and its new soul, instead, conserving, hostile to "the Washington" and the world of the finance, especially strong in the States of Central and South.
The soul, for the purpose of the purpose, has been made alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
However, this is just a example of changes, big changes, which the current economic landscape may predict or already let it be scattered: not only in the United States but in the whole of the O.E. and perhaps just here.
It seems that the crisis in Europe seems to work by a accelerator of incubation phenomenon since the new climate is solid and finally to light.
The first of these phenomenon is the renewal, the extraordinary restart, of the dual category of State-soverity in relation to a kind of renacionalisation of the §.
The crisis, in fact, is the crisis of financial institutions which, yes, have a close relationship with the foreign, but in the first place, the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single State.
What creates immediately a political problem for those who govern it: and how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families that, among other things, are also a electorate.
In fact, the crisis appears economically worldwide, but politically it is almost exclusively in.
The political internalism seems essentially outside or has not much to say: the lamping evidence is given by the European Union, which is generally divided between different interests and between the various state strategies, cannot decide any common policy line.
And this is the government of each single State that all are expecting interventions, saving and restart plans, new rules, and, in particular, fund earning: since when it comes to stress, only the States who possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that are able to try to restore things to sex.
They also have the necessary means and the legalization to use them: two incompatible value resources, in certain circumstances, of which most likely no market and none internal organisation will ever be available in the same way.
This new infarction that the crisis puts on the statual element is the remainder in perfect synthesis with the importance of the most recent developments of the Property are to attribute to a very closely linked factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxally, while we were convinced that we were in the kingdom of the network, of the more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that the globalized financing was now to dominate the world, we reached a treaty that our future would have to do increasing accounts with those little inmaterial things that are the water, the railways, the oil.
Everything that, looking at a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but yet they are absolutely linked to a circle space, to a territory.
As for those who are to be sovereign, they certainly have many cards more than those who are not, who have the happiness to live in a place without racing, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second news that predicts a fraction.
Who says Territorium, State, Government, inevitably says Politic, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomenon.
On the one hand, the knowledge of the objective needs of authorized leadership, the request of someone who knows to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a discretion for existing leadersships, economic species, so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And together something more deeply and in certain sense inquired: a discretion, an unselfishness, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distantness, which aims to involve the whole leader class in a growing number of countries in the OÂe.
It seems that it always makes it more road, in large sectors of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of social elite to grow up, their way of feeling and being, their culture in full acceptance of the term, having done their time and to be more stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The request for leadership, too, eat subterraneously a ramified but owned movement of delegation of traditional leaders and political assets, which appears in the "revolts" improved "electoral" or in the repentant runs of collective humors of these last and last times, from the conserving access in Austria-Baviera to the cross of labour consensus in Greece, to the rebellion of the American congresses against Bush (and maybe also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It is the impression that the elites translated, their parties, their programs, but also their records, their newspapers, their credited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make them always more difficult to understand, and so to represent, what is not now to take form in the deep paths of the West society and that the economic crisis reveals, grows, acts potentially dismissed.
In front of all this, talking about a "rebellion of mass" in the order of the day would be sincerely exhausted.
But to keep your eyes open, it's not for nothing.
The supercolle to walk on the walls
Override gravity laws thanks to a super-a and in the future walk on walls such as Spiderman.
It's the goal of various American research centres and now a team of four sites has gone very much.
With an advantage of only 2,5 squared metres, the students were able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American Science magazine has published the discoveries of some researchers from the Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the student team is an evolution of existing ones who use a specific carbon structure called carbon nanotubi.
“The principle of the ability can be imagined as a series of tubes systemed as a spaghetti pile” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired to the gechi's jackets, repeated by microscopics of skin that can ensure a perfect adherence to animals.
The tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and veterate paper, have shown that the new accessive is ten times more powerful than these rectangles and at the same time "speaks easily from the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Ingjøria's faculty of the Dayton University.
PATH TO MORE? -"This material might be useful as transitional accessive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of a very less fascinant use as the connection between electronic equipment, because carbon nanotubes are heating and electrical current drivers.
Other applications could be related to the Spanish Engineering.
I'm not surrounding for the moment.
Other RICERCA – Even the Berkeley University, in California, is dedicated to search for a new accessive.
In a article of the American Chemical Society, the Californian students have presented an adesitive format of microfibres as hairs that self-pull themselves from the powder during the movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never with suck of fruit
Attention on the suck of pomp, the arance and the meal.
These goods, especially consume in states because distants and vitamines, if they take simultaneously to some salvated medicinal products, they change the absorption by enhancing or decreasing efficiency according to cases with serious health consequences.
Remember the risks of fruit sucks be confessed and freshly associated with the association of some medicines David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, and from the 236th meeting in the American Chemical Society in the course of Philadella, it lays a new alarma: just a bicycle of pomp, arance and mela to reduce the absorption of some salvated medicines, cancel the benefits and risk the health of patients.
The pompelme success was already completed because it was considered to increase up to lives toxic to some anti-arithmical, antibiotic, ansiolytic, antistaminic and neurological effects.
FARMACEUTY A RISCHIO - The same Italian pharmacovigilance Agency had informed it in a two-year information bulletin warning doctors and patients not to undervalue the danger resulting from this mix and to take care of what it drinks in the case of farms such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NON SOLO POMPELMO - According to experts, also the arance suck and the meal contains substances that inhibit farms.
I long the list of active principles injected by the pomp and the other sucks.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Statal University of Milano: "These discoveries in general are immediately reported to the various agencies of the internal pharmacovigilance and na · which may cause to change the information notes of the pharmaceuticals.
So always reading the illustrative folds of medicines that are used and if there is something that is not clear, do not make us impress, but ask for clearness to the doctor or pharmacist," the experienced Ansa agency has highlighted.
The Nobel del'a to Paul Krugman
The Nobel premium for the Â was signed to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neokeynesian who teaches Princeton University and is a new editorialist in New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical choices in Bush administration and foreign policy.
A few months after the observations of September 2001, in the days in which Enron failed, Krugman had proposed in a New York Times editorial that the second event would be more determining than the first, in consequences of the United States history.
A predict that was not a few polymetics and that has been rejected to the economy for years, but that has now been revealed exactly.
“I am surprised and even a little shocked for the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the public's attention,” Krugman stated at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economy of great value" but also a developer with a very aggressive, particularly critical style against the extent of freedom of Bush's administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that is intended to reach more users, from the house to office, from professionals to public administration, as free alternative to the most known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by voluntary developers, in which SUN Microsystem is monitored, the new Open Office is shown to the large public with different news: to the welcome and to the revised and less split interface, other more substantive, such as the national compatibility of the operational system Apple Mac OS X and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) ↓, the last ISO standard version.
Notice also to interoperable with the Office suite Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, some specific features of some modules such as that allows you to reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, for example useful to send them via email, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphical processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
You can always create "hibrid PDF" documents that obtain the typical graph of the format of Adobe with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text designer.
The processing is a element that has received various improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet you can intervene in more hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on IJhes, in the text manufacturer, a color is signed in comments for better revision capacity.
Some agencies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks the final result should be released.
The Italian version is downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English that was on the mirror from Friday.
Besides, for Windows and Mac OS, as the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may also be sent home or on the workplace.
And if the freedom theme can be a train for distribution in the houses, it is just in the business that Open Office is trying the great scom, which can already count on various projects made in public administration and schools.
And they do not even miss the realities that offer a training, advice and aid for small and medium-sized, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the Word-respective video write; Calc, is the calculation sheet that looks for Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulation presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most sensitive Access is the program that will work on the database; Draw, it is set up the graphical module.
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering today we are almost 3 million and 600 miles, with the output of the new version, it is likely that you can also overcome the estimated number.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of do.
New case of positiveness to the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the best scaler bottle.
Reporting the news is the website of the daily The Team.
The 26-year Kohl is the fourth positive course in Cera, the Epo of third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccó and Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, and he of Gerolsteiner.
Analysis on the blood campions of Kohl includes those performed in the last weeks from Losanna and Chatenay-Mala.
If the conflicts confirm the positiveness in Cera, the Austrian will be the third place in the Tour and will meet the two years of Canonical Equality.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positiveness at the third generation Epo is the head of the French antido agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26th Austrian was thrown on the final podium at the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans square, also added to the beauty of the best scaler.
IMAGE: NEW YORK TIMES THIS, ITALIA'S IS EXPORTED?
Italy "from the country of immigrants has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for the immigrants" with reluctance.
This is transforming Belpaese into a nation of racists? Is it as much as you ask in a long article the New York Times who dedicated a long article to the debate on the racism theme in Italy, walking from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso or the last month in Milano for having stolen a scattole of biscotts.
This case shows what the Nyt defines the "North Paradise": Northern regions are at the same time those in which "more integration and more work" are recorded but also "the highest anti-immigrated feelings of the country and the highest support for the North Lege".
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italian and immigrants, Nyt also quoted the episodes of intolerance in Milano, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation from the Law that strikes the immigration franks and facilitates the exemption of clandestines is also quoted as a paradigma of climate change in Italy.
Tendence underlined both by Papa and by the President of the Republic: "Georgio Napolitan meeting Benedit XVI in the Quirinale asked the State and the Church to work together to disappoint racism."
Science students of car rental up to EUR 900 for a room
The market for universities doesn't know crises.
According to the latest investigation of Sunia, the inquiry syndicate, take a single room can cause a student to 900 euros in Milano, 700 in Firenze, 650 in Napoli, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has taken very serious characters at the point to exclude the whole fashion of young people from the right to study for the highests, completely that the family of origin should support - explains the ́ee of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani - in this city the strong question by students has so deformed the market to bring a generalized increase process also for residents."
In most cases, offers of afficies contain a series of violations: free, not registered contracts, without limits of canon, linked sub-affects.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of the tax tax, the prices may be calm.
Looking at the detail of the investigation, we see that in Milano, for a place in Brianza, there are about 450 euros; for a single room it takes a minimum of 650 (Sware Band zone) to a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria).
In Firenze a bed place covers in average 350/400 euros, a room of about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the near University areas, they need 250/280 euros for a double-leaving place, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double-leaving place.
Just lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near the other University (Ostiense and China City).
It is saved only if it moves in perifer areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single area in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Napoli for a bed, there are 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Amminei.
In Bari for a bed, there are 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one single place.
In the smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a larger weight in the city.
In the cities where the phenomenon of extracommunication students is more frequent, such as Perugia, is recorded a further anomalie: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested for foreign students than that applied to the Italian.
Adio old film Paradiso, towns cancel the history sales
History cinematography rooms are closed in favour of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic sales is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The picture offered by the register of Joseppe Tornador photographs effectively as it is in the large Italian cities but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinema, with the birth of the big multisale and the consequent death for the confusion of monosale in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem to us unusual and inconsistent but also has all the characteristics of a true and self-cultural crime.
It is often historical and memory places,"that is as if there were less a friend, a knower with whom we shared a part of a road and many emotions," observes the record of New Movie Paradise, the film that 20 years ago was in Tornador the Oskar Price and the Great Price of Cannes' jury, and who counted the poesy of a province room and nostalgia for a way to live the cinema may be lost forever.
The numbers provided by Anec, the main association of exerites, are clear: In the past five years have closed the 316 films of tradition, and to pay the greater score are especially the sales in the main cities: 10 less to Firenze, 9 to Milano, Napoli, Bologna and Roma, 6 less to Torino, 5 to Palermo.
Among the most closed regions, Emilia-Romagna has 82 persuaded monosala cinema, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And showing that the first of their disagreement is the event of the multiplex, these are exactly these three Italian regions who have registered the largest number of new multisale films: 195% more in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 or in Toscana or Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irraally” notes Paul Protti, President of Anec”, is useful to build new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure the overwhelmingness of those already existing, because when a city room closes, not all of its attendants are ready to transfer to multiplex.
To not then speak of the missing fund for the exercise fund: the State's pre-rate debt is about 10 million euros.
It is confused, from ethical and moral view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be a year.’
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, who, concerned about closures, decided to run to the repairs with the signature of a protocol between Commun and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote the monosal cinema both in the history centre and in periferia.
Among the rules provided for, there are measures for tax facilitation for public managers and benefits in mobility: the spectators can enter into a limited traffic area and will have special tariffs for the substance and some parkings.
“It is a initiative that I like” notes Joseph Tornador and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting other measures in feet.
It is true, however, that to contrasting the strapoter of multiplex traditional sales must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more needed.
The film's tradition is a subject that always was important for me: the closure of the Superkinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adultery, was the shintilla that convinced me to do "New Movie Paradise", which I thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walked before the Realt or to the Training Chirurge Na≤ I was closed, where I lived a lot of shared emotions, so that I don't see the cartridges from the powder I'm turning away from the other side."
Legislatives between political and arrested officers of Joia Tauro
"The office of Gioia Tauro was to uniform the choices of the Common to the interests of the piroma cosca."
The accusations that the directors of the Antimaphia Directory of Calabria refer to the office and vicinity of Joia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the office of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested tomorrow for outer concurrence in mafiosa association.
In Manet also, Joacchino Piroma, the elderly mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his boss' grandfather, who was already condemned for association with mafious print crime, condemned to reimburse 10 million euros.
"In the presence of any legal and moral standard, as well as of good sense," writes the applicants, the two local administrations had expressed the will of paying advice to a lawyer Piroma.
"It would have been so granted to the cosca - writing the Jews - to officially enter the munitions by facilitating the opportunities, already intense, control and indigenous of the public administration."
The President of the Regional Calabre Joint Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local and organized malavity institutions" in its region are many: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in other, where the ́soulsion is almost unemployable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressure of the "draught, heroes who keep themselves clean."
Tomorrow arrests follow those of the last July with which the police announced that he had decaped the Piroma cosca.
From the end of April last, the Communal Council of Joia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for consequences between organised criminality and local administration, local policies were raised by the task of administration of the Community.
George Dal Torrione, Udc's officer at the time of the shopping, was chosen at the head of a central right coalition, after the ballot of May 2006.
He cried to the scandal when the Prefecture made the discharge of the Communal Council.
He called the Minister of the Internal Marco Min ́ in this case, being protected by all for a political issue, but the Jews, in the order of arrest signed tomorrow, explain that Piroma's cosca was accompanied to ask for the change of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions against Dal Torrione, writes pms, "the ability to marry the needs of an immigrant, representative of a larger group notorially to Piroma, uniforming the choices of public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When energy is born from the walls, the bigs are now going down in the field
It's a devastated jailment, which takes over 70% of the planet's surface, and now the large global energy companies are discovering it.
Where, currently, the sea are the new renewable sources on which the eyes have been put on, and now they are trying to put their hands, colds like Chevron.
The possibility of recovering energy from sea movements is studied from hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in comparison with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil falled in 1980, the idea of use of marine energy was partly, but now the environmental instinctions and the new increase of oil are impulsed to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the world’s electrical baby could be covered by the explosion of the seas.
This amount would be the double of that currently produced by nuclear centres.
And in addition, there would be rivers and sea.
Columns at the attack.
The first enterprise to deal with marine energy was Enersis, which signed in 2005 an agreement to build an engine in the North of Portugal.
When the intelligence was announced, it seemed a revolutionary.
In two years of distance to deal with marine energy, they are always more and among these axes voted forever to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the ocean energy technologies - has declared the portfolio of a company associated with the United States Oil Country at the Wall Street Journal economy - and it evaluates the possibility of cooperating with us."
This cooperation relates to the obtaining of an authorisation from the United States Energy Committee, which is necessary to launch a draft use of marine energy in Alaska.
It is a sign not shortly, especially if it is considered that in Alaska uses continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has started a plan for new trivellations.
Besides Chevron, there are the Ver > Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel through the street of energy that comes from the sea and the amounts that have been invested until now, as not noted in the details, they indicate, according to observers, an accessibility interest.
Technology to set up.
Experts are talking about a technology still at the springs, even because the marine energy does not flee all of the doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, such as Portuguese or some in Scotland are small and seems not to create big eco problems.
To produce energy on a long scale, however, technologies should be used with a higher environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, use a good system connected between them.
The stream of the walls, which makes the boys move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders within the bullets.
Pressure turns a turbine that at his time eats a generator.
Electricity is sent to riva through submarine caves.
For now, there are four inquiries of this type of design, just waiting for federal approval and part of energy can serve for a military installation.
Instead, the Ver→ Power already produces energy for a commercial center and a parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when the sea is, turns the turbines' balls, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Veră said he had a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to enjoy energy.
After the walls, the walls.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electric Energy Research, deserves currently the potential of the sea.
Although it is a intermittent phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the walls and therefore more reliable as energy source.
It is exactly on the energy of the sea that were like the new York, Âe and Alaska, together with other costs, have already invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and have been expected to invest up to 35 million for 2009.
