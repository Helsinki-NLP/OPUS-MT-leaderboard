The Prague Bolsa ended with less points at the end of the journal
After the fast fall of the morning, the Prague Bolsa corrected its losses.
The transactions of the CHEZ actions reached approximately the half value they have in a normal day.
The Prague Bolsa, at the beginning of March, repeated immediately to the fall of the moon when it descended approximately 6%.
The low of this time is due to the fall of action in Wall Street.
There is also expressed the market reaction to the result of the vote of the American Representative Assembly, which refused to support the Stabilisation Plan of the Secretary of the Financial Sector.
Causes of actions in Asia
The acts of the Asian Bolsas lived on Thursday a dramatic fall, although during the day it finally reached part of losses.
The Boulsa Hang Seng of Hong Kong during its financial day marked nearly four percent, although later he reduced its losses by reducing the decline in nearly 2,5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises, following the movements of Chinese actions in the Hong Kong Bolsa, descended a 3.8 percent in Shangai, the markets were closed.
The actions of the Sidney Bolsa have lost more than five percent but, finally, the losses descended to 4.3 percent.
The Taywan Bolsa is the Index secretary descended to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue action scheduled in the United States are unsecure and this affects the world's financial market," said the Hong Kong Monetary Boss, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, which is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as the United States.
The American legislators should return to the meeting as soon as possible, the Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Blood bathroom of American actions
On Monday, the American Representative Assembly 日 the financial aid plan to which 700 billion dollars should be dedicated (only 12 billion crowns).
The legislators thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support their plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bathroom and mainly the action collected the most fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones' decline was nearly seven percent. A similar volume fall was recently registered in 1987.
The Assembly's proposal did not come out, the empe > to fall freely.
The congress is revoked: The US Government can inject $700 billion in the area
The highest representatives of the Congress and the Government, President George W. Bush, agreed in a broad terms of financial assistance to the American financial system.
Its vote will be made at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators caused a breach in the discussions on the approval of the rescue plan in their form of aid to the American financial system with $700 billion (approximately $12 billion).
However, it's not yet won't.
Congressists should draw up some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law and vote.
The financial aid plan will be discussed on Monday at the Representative Assembly.
On Monday, he said to the Agency Re—s, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee for Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly.
There are some sources, the vote on the plan could be made in the Senate not before midnight.
The economicists, the ratification of the redemption plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalisation of the financial market.
Thereafter, however, the "decenting" will be reached thanks to the complete mechanisms which market aid will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have done a great progress.
We resolve our discrepant opinions regarding how to have the market stability package," democrate Nancy Pelosiá recommended the Bloomberg Agency.
If it is it, the final vote could still be made on Sunday.
The representatives of the legislators gathered on Monday night with the Minister for Finance, Henry Paulson, to give him a definitive form to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial companies the non-selling hypotechnical assets that lead to financial companies to harm losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are ready to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the health plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
Global financial crisis is expressly on the market of actions quickly running.
The Democracy Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing all that is possible to ensure that the Congress definitively adopts an agreement this Sunday.
They want to quiet the investors' businesses in the Asian financial market because these are those who are located in the first time course and where the Congress could influence the trade of the Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clearly clear about when the two American Congress cameras will vote and, if it does not, they will be at the last time with any problem.
The legislators believe that it will be approved in the next days.
However, the law will suffer a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme does not comply with its role, which would be another 100 billion dollars and, later, of the last 350 billion dollars.
Bush valued the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the Chairman may take this decision but the Congress can overcome its vice by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme was maintained to win financial resources for the recovery of bad hypotechnical titles whose value was fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans were not able to finish paying their hypoteches.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of representatives should be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator, Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of meetings.
His carrier, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the Sabbath progress and that values "the emphasis of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of the blinded contract
The Chairman of the Senate Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the programme's money for the protection of contributors of their losses, an alivio clause of the plan of funds.
The new law should also limit the claimed blinded contracts to directors of the participating companies in the programme, and create a committee with a control of the Fund.
This should be addressed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made a great progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson recommended.
The plan also relates to the help of household owners who have problems with their payments.
The Government should agree with the new payments of the hypoteques to be purchased in order to reduce the payments of the debtors at the time and allow them to stay with their homes.
Mark: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, if it is the Chef of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be made but very difficult.
"And this is why it is not known with which mechanism and the price the problems of assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the server iHNed.cz.
Let the plan be approved now or at the beginning of the next week is not, Marek, so relevant.
"Too much more important is that, this week, the congressists agree with their support and give him their view well before it is possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval is, at this time, the most important," insisted Marek.
The MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can get calls.
What seems clear is better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for the human to add only the player.
The election is practically depending on the way it uses and the need for the future owner.
Probe will be difficult to add the most modern tocade disks to listen to the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as the LP disks are no longer out, and with regard to their quality there is no one objective reason to continue to understand them.
If the vinyl discs are rock, jazz or blues in their stations, it is probably dreaming at least with this type of games.
This is the same with the music that is on the road, namely, compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here are price and quality categories.
For some, it can be unacceptable to cost eight thousand crowns in a player, as for a Pink Floyd lovers that will hardly test the marketing cases of twenty coroners.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each.
The choice is large.
Determines also the duration of the battery
Some of the best players can get much more than just play music, even what they do not even have the majority of the mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elemental functions such as phone, send messages, you can play music and video, you both, you have a better or worse graphographic device and you can even get browser.
And when we take into consideration the artphone and the PDA will also have a small computer in your bottle.
This is a small milesheet because no nearest knows to make a parrillad and no television can photograph.
The universality of the mobiles also brings us desperate.
How many more functions you use in the mobile before the screen indicator will be illustrated asking to be reloaded.
And music playing is one of the largest energy tragedies.
Small are the mobiles that can play music more than ten or twelve hours, most more less.
In this sense, music players (in particular the most simple) have clearly a higher performance.
Thus, take note of that small mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If, above, they continue to be called, for more safe, a loader for work - this is also valid for the lovers.
With the MP3 player, this problem will not have it, because even the worst endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem occurs in music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, only one part of the devices is available from the USB universal engine and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music is possible directly in the memory card, but only in some unreductional readers units can connect small memory cards that are used in the mobile.
In players, with any option (iPod), no special software is required.
Success to fill the device with music with the USB of the computer.
Most mobile and players create their order only in the music library is the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, gender, or also the user assessment.
Some devices only show a directory with tree like a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (ver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart telephones with operating system).
The player serves, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific team, it is interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the ability of memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its management.
If you hear, especially, music as a background, and you will listen to it every day only a mouse, like in the train, then you're enough with any mobile that plays.
What practically gets really any mobile.
Not even if you are interested in the format where the mobile or player plays music.
The MP3 plays it all and almost all the music you get will be in this format.
It is located between the most extended and except to him the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
At least includes the AAC format (format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobiles, for example, also allow music purchase online.
It's enough through the mobile Internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and to buy a song or album.
This service could be only a weight argument to buy a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is weak, and most are limited only to radio successful issues.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, in general, this way of sale of music (which is by GSM, Internet or Internet) in the future will dominate music industry.
Most people always carry up a mobile.
When you appetite to hear something, you will find the mobile in your bottle, while the MP3 player will remain in the house.
However, it still depends on whether you always get aurical or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player with approximately every mobile even if it is at least a MP3 player.
Probe the most benefit for many of the music mobiles will be your price.
The smallest cost us usually less than three thousand.
Three to four thousand crowns can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of a classic audicular entry.
The best, including regarding the technical part, such as phones equipped with an entry of 3,5 mm. for classic audiculars, covers up to fifty thousand.
Again, the benefit of players is nothing else than their easy service.
The most simple players - in no way necessaryly the most beautiful (see our selection) - actually manages any person.
The minimum functions, their management like the previous running cases or tocads are evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that we are connected to the Internet for mistakes with the mobile and, therefore, gigantic accounts for download of data.
For which device to decide
Even the most beautiful mobiles (for example, Vodafone 527) have generally a place to change memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card, it will reach the two thousand crowns.
Nevertheless, be careful.
Basic models, usually, are equipped with only 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the lovers have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy a MP3 bar player, you have a look at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Capacity (max. 2 GB) is not required to cost more than 1.100 crowns.
If you are considered among the most exciting music lovers, you have the most specialized mobile mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes such a comfortable service as the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles on the walkman line have almost identical use as one of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in respect of the price, over the four thousand coroners, but with a greater memory capacity (to 16 GB) and a cumulator (normally 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the mark that is more likely to bring them to MP3 players.
The first operator will already come to the Czech Republic this year.
Test
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is very developed, and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, there is still something we need here - the operator, which would force those to be more poor.
Probe'e's not going to come soon.
That the Czech operators are part of the lovers of Europe, we have already written it in mobil.cz.
The rest also confirmed the Czech Telecommunication Office, which warned that the price of the SMS messages in our country is of the lovers of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming rates, it probably reaches a paradoxical situation - for some Czech mobile operators clients, the SMSs that send from the foreign will be better than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that he really wants to fight.
Try this looks paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
In contrast, mobile operators like to regret that there is a extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTU), Pavel Dvořák, has also expressed that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operators.
It may be true that for a classic operator with its own network no longer have too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the operator.
Exactly the income of the operator on the mobile phone market brought a highlighted price downstairs before which classic operators should have also re-employed.
At the same time, even before the entrance of tiburons, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain were heard similar voices both there and there.
It was demonstrated that there was a place for this type of operators and that they could have success.
Moreover, it is not necessary to look for examples too far.
In February of this year, we informed you about the outside of the Mobilking Operator in Poland.
Only after a half year, this operator was able to obtain more than 100 thousand clients and to become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking, the Penta group is located that, otherwise, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The benefit of the operators is in the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
Moreover, so that they can work effectively, they are enough with many less clients than a classic operator.
They do not carry out large expenditure in construction, functioning and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of operators are normally profiled with low expenditure - they offer calls and messages of SMS that, however, are often contrary to the most adjusted services offer.
Thus, for example, the mobile Tesco in Great Britain offers SMS at least half of the bars in respect of competition.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, it may be a good fight also the laying up by no trivial target group.
This operator is directed specifically to man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator who loves and in whom you can trust," says David Seibert, the Mobile Entertainment Company CEO, who works this operator.
It's hard to say if it's like a concept like the Polish could income in our country.
That is why the Vodafone portator, Miroslav Čepisk: "The Czech market is small for segments in which the majority of operators are based.
Moreover, from the point of view of the service offer is saturated"
There are no possibilities in the Czech Republic, said mobile operators
However, it seems almost sure that if there are any operators in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the extension of this successful project, however, in the R. Checa does not seem too hopeful.
It is better about mobilking in other countries of our region," he said in telephone chat for mobile.cz, Jana Studničková, Porter of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, he assured that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic definitively do not turn to this idea.
In contrast, they do all that is possible so that there is no potential competition.
Interesting on the employment of a mobile operator already shows that GTS Novera group would like to make a step further to become a real competence of Telephone O2 in the field of business clients.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed phone services but also mobile phone services.
And how much before, better.
With this possibility, we have met us again with all the Czech mobile phone operators.
With some of them, we have been able to progress at the meetings," Paul Kaidl said the portfolio of the group.
Well, maybe they're deploying better times.
It seems that, by non-official information, the first official operator would have to reach at the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an incomplete wall of silence.
"Now we believe that the situation is genuine for the appearance of a Czech market operator.
The Czech market in comparison with others is a very specific market.
Even the present no one has directed us with a complete and serious project on this ground," he expressed for mobil.cz, Vlastimil Srszeň, telephone O2 portator.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
The T-mobile portator, Martina Kemrová, in accordance with O2, adds: "We today have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally useful, can continue development."
And adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find some operator until the end of the year.
Now we should have some concrete contracts on the table that would be possible to study in such a short time."
Vodafone guides its attention to the fulfillment of the own requirements of a license 3G.
Miroslav Čepisk adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential operators, and this is about the distribution of expenditure and infra.
Exactly, we consider it as the greatest contribution from the point of view of the customers.
The main Vodafone strategy in this field is located in the partner with which to establish a network for a quick internet on the mobile."
Offices responsible - with the own and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understanded, but the income of another operator would mean to increase competition, which would lead to a low price and with this, to a decrease of profits.
So why to facilitate the entry to competition?
When the operators want to get something, they are going to take from one eye, testing that is the agarron when U:phone came up.
Maybe the highest pressure at the CTU was at the time of U:phone input by T-Mobile society.
It confirms public information available on the web pages of the CTU.
But exactly now U:phone serves as an argument why not accept a operator.
Martina Kemrová adds this: "In addition, no longer the environment on the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the income of another player on the market would provide for him and, in particular, for its large requirements."
That is why this access to mobile operators is extremely disalent because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not only the position of the CTU, which, despite all, does not have any competition to intervene in commercial claims, in contrast to Great Britain and other developed countries.
This is purely belonging to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Licences (UOHS).
However, this expressed its typical position before this problem.
"The entry of a mobile phone operator to the market would be possible after a conference on the infra-acquirer required between a mobile telephone operator and a operator.
Even today no convention has been closed because the offer of the most interested potential was not sufficiently interesting for classic operators," Kristian Chalupa added to our question from the UOHS External Relations Department.
These statements are not subject to the representatives of the operations.
For Offices to represent consumers' interests is something more than a consideration, otherwise they should notice that no one uses its position on the market.
Especially when Christián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign workers normally, we can note that their market entry has contributed to the low prices of mobile phone services"
Obviously, pressure on the correct market media function and price lowness does not enter the interest of UOHS.
Really, the dramaticly shocking in all this case is in the disoning reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is actually a challenging, it is offered for himself alone.
It is the same as the price of gasoline in gasolines, because it is clear that it is the work of chaos and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found any signs of disloyal competition and has therefore no reasons to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position as follows have a relevant responsibility in their market actions.
The tools necessary to open the mobile phone market to the operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added to their response.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
Clearly, there is an analysis of relevant markets produced by the CTU where telecommunications are a single market from the view of the commercial licitation.
In this type of market, naturally, no of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a operator to come, it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has the monopolie of your network.
Therefore, in a specific segment it must be necessaryly dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS should be a warning that three mobile operations are called likely.
The current wounds of the interested (including the GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with operations, many likely prevents.
Loading responsibility in the CTU is a very common truck in the field of telecommunications from which UOHS lays hands in all this matter.
We've already met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Law for the extension of the CTU competition in the field of commercial claims that have not been carried out, even when a series of specialists promised that the situation would be improved.
This must be perfectly known by UOHS representatives, but it is obvious that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything's fine, when nobody looks at
At the same time, something still works unexpectedly, as well as a pseudovirtual operator that already exists in the Czech mobile phone networks.
They are undertakings that make their own prices to mobile phone services that, however, only one part is public.
It is usually businesses dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephone services.
Normally, only some elections receive the list of prices of these companies.
The magic is that the company, in relation to the operation, acts as a classic business client of the same by acquiring a large number of SIM cards.
As a special client, it will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the trade conditions in all Czech mobile phone operators prohibited that type of revenge.
"If cases are discovered like those mentioned could be spoken of crime under contract conditions that could be translated at the end of the cooperation with the given society," he answered the question on this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is pretty unlike that an activity of this type performed by mobile phone operators would not reach responsible people.
Exactly in the case of the three mentioned companies, thousands of customers can be treated.
No operators are opposed to this procedure.
With these enterprises' activities, there are no disappointable benefits and, at the same time, in the contrary to the authentic operators - no way they threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepisk warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows this type to speculate, however, the services of this company are only used for a hundred of customers.
These must also accept that the SIM card of its phone is not at his name so they can't be absolutely available to him as a normal customer of the operas."
That is exactly what I should look like the THU at least strange.
Moreover, there is a new question for UOHS.
If mobile phone operations turn the eyes into this type of procedure, why block the entry of the operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if it does not want to satisfy the exposures of the operations that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
We'll stop being the most dear
As it was already clear in the text, the entry of the operator on the mobile phone market brought a significant decline in the prices of services.
At the same time, nearly in all countries where the operator had occurred, classic operations had more or less protected themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have been intervened at this time, and in no case they defended operations except their customers.
With formal measures or official pressure, the first operator has already been able to take place and others have started to get more.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority all of this case happens as if it had been a key to hang.
For our experience, we can not stop impressioning that the confusion of assignments in these cases will be convinced.
But we don't desperate.
If this information between the bastidor is correct and the operator really comes to these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market probably begins to move again.
If any of the operations lets any mobile phone operators enter, it will be difficult that UOHS may remain independent of the (disposition) of other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling more dear than in the rest of Europe.
The new chec hino has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official of the Czech hino.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official Office of the hino where my home.
The new himno was buried by the orchestra of the National Teatro under the direction of Jiří Belohłavek.
There are four versions - two versions that are Solos, one by men and one by female voice, another with Coro and another instrumental.
Del canto is responsible for Catherine Prince and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the Him's arrangements are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Whitehłavek considers this national cheque angle as one of the most beautiful himnos.
The Czech Radio has already said before he was intentionally chosen for the Songless Solos with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have made with the two and then, also with the Core that they have been set in the word that the text may be well understanded, that it may have consciousness," he recommended.
Czech official hino celebrates the next year of its 175 anniversary.
The song Where, my Hogar sounded for the first time in 1834 in the theatre tables of the States in the original cheese work Fidlovačka of Joseph Kaietán Tyl and regulated with the French Schroup music.
He won popularity, and people did it.
The first strife of the song after the surrounding of Checoslovakia in 1918 became naturally part of the official healing.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the outcome of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hell sounds
The Prague MHD leads us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transport Entrepreneur on the date when the first passengers enter into the metro, tranway and bus with a good email in their bottles instead of a paper billet.
This can be purchased at this time for almost hundred thousand people who have the Opencard card.
The passengers can buy the bond of 30 days, 90 days and the year (they will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously carry it on their chip card in the infocentres and posts of the transport company at the stations of the Metro, Museum, Mostek, Nadraží Holešo, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajska Zahrada, Kacherov and Luka.
Bonds can be bought from yesterday on the transport company pages, www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred people until the afternoon.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of trade can definitively begin from the sales of billets in the metro stations, where they had to regularly make school to get out a normal billet.
The good is bought on the Internet, and the Opencard card reloads you in some of the thirty branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a personally prepared window available for passengers that helps interested people with the Internet purchase and the reload of the good bought on their card," said the project portator, Martin Opatrny.
Besides the library, it will also be possible to reload the e-mail bonus in Opencard in the automatic machines expenses which are located in some metro clothing.
How are these machines expenses?
They're red, we're reordered to a machine to pick billets, and the travelers are probably already fixed on them at the stations of the metro of Roztyly, Bu月ovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska.
"Now there are five in the city but at the end of the year there should be eight", Opatrny completed.
The good is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just to introduce the Opencard chip card in it and the previous paid good will be loaded only in it.
Electronic goods from morning are valid not only in the capital but also in their areas.
It means, in the cycling trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the residents of Central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague, there are revisors equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus area," explained the control of the billets, Philip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which sets the timers of the collective transport of Prague.
The cycling buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver's stack.
When entered, it is not only necessary to show the cart to the driver but also to join it with Opencard in the place for it on the side of the box.
Consequently, the driver controls the validity of the good.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than requesting the driver this information," Drápal completed.
The passengers who do not travel in the cycling buses and remember when the bonus is finished can be addressed to machines expose where cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, information on the validity of your document will be shown.
Southeasts wanted to be part of the United States in a reference
In 1945, the German Southers requested that fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is drawn out of the letter that is stored in the collection of the Cientical Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the United States patronate.
With this desire, some groups of Southern Germans were probably addressed to the President of the U.S. in 1945.
The result of the letters that are stored in a particular file and that today are stored in the collection of the Centic Library of South Bohemia.
Germans from Cheský Krumlov request in a letter to the American President that does not allow the return of the "Shumava territory" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of Munich's ́ ́s - again to Checoslovakia.
"We understand the situation correctly and we really want his word that the American units are coming to German lands, not as oppressors or enemies, but as liberators," it is written in the letter, signed with a "the people who lead the destination of Shumava in their heart".
Since the Union of Czech Slovakia with the south-east Germans presumely supposes these national characters - a hope only in brutality, disconsideration, incomprehension, pressure, and slave, the authors claim in the letter to the American President who takes for today and forever to Shumava under a protector.
"We can not believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are delivered to a foreign state that oppresss and agits minorities and that absolutely cooperates with the victory of the aliens," it is written in the letter.
The reason for which the authors cannot sign is probably the fear of the "check oppressors".
If the President of the United States assumely doubts about this idea of the Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on whether their residents want to be part of the United States or to live under their patronate.
Although the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have of the history of poster, can sound a little infant, some specialists are carefully painting the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast.
Although the Germans had to imagine at least that it was to be treated about their exposure from the Republic only a few of them would admit this opportunity.
Some have hoped that the United States and the Great Britain would negotiate some clear way of autonomy for Southerns.
Others believed they would stay in Czech Slovakia.
It even confirms the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czeška Bu日.
This was in the war, like the German of Bu日, round in the Baltic sea.
When at the end of the war, the britains deployed him and placed him in Holstein prisoners for decades of Germans came to him to teach them the Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would come well," Chalupa said.
No of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czech Slovakia, if he was, counted that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes, they would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most face action in the Czech history addressed to security on roads.
This could be characterized by the emotional campaign that decided to launch the Transport Ministry on Wednesday.
The Minister's office, Aleš Rebiček promises that he will disobey the drivers of dangerous conduct to the volant.
The 150 million campaign will be felt in television, radio, cinema, Internet and brochures.
I'd have to disobey the high speed and alcohol driver to the flight.
And to remember them also, before they go on, the circles are attracted.
He wants to reach consciousness, especially all of the young drivers, motorists, peatons, and finally also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the announcements?
Basically human stories that embedded to emotions.
And for this, the "sanguinary" announcements were to be attached to us during the whole campaign:
Don't think - pay!
The word "Don't think" is written with large letters in the matrix.
And in a blood chat is the word "pagas".
This must symbolize that man at a time of disfellowship can come to pay with his own life.
The announcements will "meet fear" to the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was allowed to be inspired by the campaign conducted in Anglossian lands where strong images of accident victims can be observed.
It promises that it will reduce accidents and the number of dead in the Czech roads.
The announcements have been made by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and milk for drivers
"For drivers the sugar and lactic system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red seam, and so wears time.
The latigo is threatening a lot or an accident.
The drivers must remember the risks," says the hospital transport psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
It is therefore necessary for an informative campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, particularly psychological.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there is a panel installed by warning of some dangers, it will probably be combined with the environment soon, and the driver will not give you more attention," warned Kořán.
Olmert would almost all the areas occupied in exchange of peace
The President of the provisional Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, was pronounced on the refund of nearly all the lands occupied in 1967, namely, the West Jordania, Jerusalem east and the Highs of Golan, in turn of peace with Palestinian and Syria.
I proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth journal.
"We should reach a agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we need to refund almost all lands (occuped) if it is not all," Olmert said to the journal.
"We will certainly remain with a hundred of these lands, but the Palestinians must cease a hundred like (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that Jerusalem would also be included in the case of refund.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore doesn't want tractors or excavates to pass over their feet as it happened to one of my best friends, then he will deliver one part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed to the two Julie attacks in the city where several dead and tens of people were hurt.
The President will need to find "a special solution for the temple mountain, holy and historical place" which is located within the former city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted further.
Retraction of the Highs of the Golan
Olmert also spoke about the department of Israel from the Highs of the Golan, which from his view is an inherent with Property to conclude a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also make concrete efforts by the part of the EEC.
"I'm not suggesting to close peace with Syria only on the basis of Golan's retreat," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to divorce to win the Golan.
They will leave their current relationships with Iran, they must leave their relationships with Hizbulá (Chita movement), they must be separated from the permanent support that causes Hamas terrorism (Chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Yihad (the Santa War) in Iraq,” the Prime Minister concreted.
Questions after the accident: Are the azaphates illegal in the buses?
Law is unknown, cannot be walked in a long distance bus
With regard to the tragic accident of the bus of the Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova, we have the question of whether azaphates and passengers can be moved through the bus during the travel.
"If we want to be strict and formally complied with the law, the azafat activity is opposed to the Vial Transit Law," says the carrier of the Transport Ministry, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the azaphate of twenty-five years died last week was obviously caused by the driver of the truck only that the bus was crossed on the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting at the side of the driver at the less safe location of the vehicle, despite having reserved two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or breathe suddenly, and at the precise time the azaphat divides the coffee or the periodics.
This is what the paper plays is if the bus is dead, it is the technical permission, with places of stone.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit down.
The long distance buses of Student Agency have no sites to go, which confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jančura, and Currently.cz.
"This is what we have solved with the Ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, it was removed and we agreed that passengers could go to the bathroom while the bus is going, if it is that they have a seat," he recommended his position.
Azafata doesn't know the law
" There is no evidence legal interpretation of the role of the azafat - no legal provision explains this function.
Not if any legal provision is prohibited by transport agents to carry out any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of the vehicle Reviewer whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds the Hanzelka portfolio less tactfully.
The director of the Department of Transport Traffic by the Ministry of Transports, Joseph Pokorny, considers that the law is sufficiently involved in this problem.
"Depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have stage sites.
That's all," he says.
Business is divided between urbans, where there are sites to stand and maximum speed, interrupt us with sites to stand with a higher speed permission and the long distances without places to go, with the greatest speed permission and with sats equipped with security circle.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP Safety Expert, Jaroslav Horén, does not see important problems with the movement of azafat in the bus.
"In the development of the travel there is no much threat to danger, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
Not if it's here it's the security that turbulences come and that the azaphat can be cut into the head."
" However, if the bus suddenly breathes evidently that the physical laws are valid.
Like in a city bus or in the tranway.
The safety of the azaphat must solve the internal transportist regulation," he also thinks that this problem is unresolved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter who offers the service of azaphates.
Use two hundred in it.
The director, not after the accident, considers that risked work.
"Now, when you have the impression that the position of azaphat is risked, then I will remove it.
Coffee and magazines can receive it, passengers, when they come in.
"I'd even rebuild the expenditure," he says.
In the interest of security, Asiana has no azaphates in its vehicles, Alexej Litvin, which leads a small line compared to SA.
"We have no azaphates, we're against them since the beginning.
Annes or later this will end in a mortal accident," he said less than one year ago for Tiden.cz.
A huge tragedy happened
In the accident of the line that one in Napoles died a young azaphat of Pilsen who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the stationary carrier by locking the step to the bus without using the intermittents.
His driver was trying to avoid it in a quick manner, however, with the part of front.
Jančura refuses to have sold the two sites reserved for the rest of the azafat.
"These sites are not able to reserve them for long distance connections, they are locked."
The company intends to request the carrier.
The agency will not wait for the judgement on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenditure also by the guilty.
Reform the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of azaphat in the bus, in which 30 experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport are working for a year ago.
" However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but more to the system of points, the maximum speed in the bus and the use of the mobile during the run," says expert Horien.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the azaphates something that threats the safety of passengers as important," Hanzelka's carrier concluded that the safety control in bus is the competence of the police and the Security Office in the work.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported in Francfort
In the letter of the Joint Directive of West LB for its partners, there are no large words.
By the combination of Dusseldorf's units with DEKA, a central capital market of Sparkassen's financial group can be formed, as it says the writing, published on Monday
West LB, breaking the `concurrence block' with sustainable benefit capacity would enter into such business.
Furthermore, such a combination may be a beginning for the following fusions in the field of regional areas.
This is how it understands the text, when a joint directive wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because as before the West LB is under a huge pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union but also from the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services, which has recently made clear to the Government of the North-Westphalia that there is a little time to find a solution.
A long time ago, also from the part of Francfort, it has been spoken much about the association of such type between the DEKA, that Sparkasse clients know for their investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August, let him know that he doesn't see any sense in the fussion of the Property, held on the street ́ser Street, with a regional area such as Helaba or West LB.
However, the management Council of the DEKA, which is now composed of regional holdings and Sparkassen's associations, responsibility for a joint directive to start negotiations with West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be treated with a business on the capital market or some of its parts.
Of course, negotiations have just started, so it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time the consolidation in Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA's name that with its 3000 partners is among the most important enterprises in the France's financial site.
In 2003, the situation looked like that the DEKA could join the region of Renania-Palatinado and Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-partial union has remained without results.
Only the plans were made public, the Hesse Government expressed against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two responsibility also did not find the same language.
Instead of this, the region of the Renania-Palatinado empires the dialogue with the region of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of the DEKA fusing with other regional holdings.
But finally, Günther Merl, President of the Joint Directive of Helaba, expressed that he was against the plans of coexistence with its own.
Independently, it seems to be clearer that the union of the various public rights areas is necessary.
Then, when the elections of the Baviera parliament will be held, the BayernLB Union with the region of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
This is not necessarily a good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure continues to grow, Helaba will miss the partners to do that.
In the southern, it could be only a young partner, although it has even overcome much better than the financial crisis that Stuttgart and Munich's immobility did.
On the other hand, Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which had 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year, avoided coexistence plans with West LB.
In any case only the North LB remains.
But such geo-strategic reflections are just one part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different models.
In June, Merl made a fundamental question about a commercial model that could ensure the future for regional Property, which the Sparkassen-und Giro-Verband deutsche has not answered until now.
Finally, the West LB can be decomposed, but it is, of course, not its own desire.
Thus, in the letter of the Joint Directive, it is also said that there would be a complete solution for the whole
As cohesion can be compacted between the individual parts of the depth with the DEKA, it will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the end of the week of the Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth.
But this time, he assessed Elena as his girlfriend, and therefore everything seems different, he says.
After them, at the side of a 5 litres of march beer, Kaiser is built a huge tigre that shows almost 200 participants in Octoberfest that lower sounds know producing in his gargant.
First Elena gives Luca a palmade, then a beach.
They came from Bolonia to Verona.
From there, from the parking side of the train station Porta Newa, tonight at 23:45 three buses, `Munich, the festival of the beer', pressed at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are in particular for the Italian, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the eases of the parking at the side of his flag, the South Americans are sing, they have already started to celebrate tonight.
With a lot of voice, Marco Hold says, that is nothing for the Italians.
In Marco, which takes a long cover with a artificial skin bowl and wheels with silver pieces, it belongs to these buses.
Since five years ago, they come to October Fest, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
Last night on the road there, during the day in the street, at the 22.30th hour.
Passing the night there means only unnecessary expenditure, says Marco.
The travel cost 75 euros, including the receipt of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made, was made by the Baviera purity law, illness insurance and guide in Germany-Marco attended a language course in France.
The buses are already on the road in the bus with the "Brennero" address
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the rest of the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they will still need forces.
It is for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian matrix make another pause in the carway 8 short before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking at the side of the Prade de Teresa, there are some 50 other buses in Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathered together, Marko has his last talk about the way to go.
First, you'll put a yellow grass.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", on the side of the Gotical Book is the page of the Marco Travel Office on the Internet: "knowcersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors of the campaign's tent are opened, that means go!", she cries Marco in the morning.
"Go!" Go and occupy the back sites in the campaign's tent.
"Do not take the places forward, for we will block, and all with yellow grapes you shall not sit in the same bank, divided throughout all space!"
A litre of beer, Marco, is worth 8.25 euros.
Do Not Live Yourself
Show the people of security that we have a good ton!
Only get out of his place, he will be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at the ten and half you have to come here!" Did you understand?
And now everyone goes to Octoberfest.
One, to mark the road, to the yellow grass in the trees, trading signals and even in a map of the elections of a large Popular Party of Baviera.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It's the second weekend of Octoberfest which is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no precise data about the number of people; it is about 50,000 people who travel on the Alpes and who tormentfully enter the campaign tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend of Italy.
The Police of Munich receives aid from seven police from the Autonomous Provincia of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red de Baviera that makes a statistics of the present nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, take the first place before the English (approximately 60 assistance) and the Austrians.
The preferred tent of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
The nights without sleep for the Real Estate's creditors
The German Property System is stabil, only the last week focused on the Federal Ministry of Finances Peter Steinbrück.
However, the political would use the word "relatedly" and added that the German area would also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the financing of Munich immobile, quoted in DAX, receives a billion credit from the German consortium in order to resist turbulences on the market.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation said to Re·s: Credit aid was up to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Real Estate will use has to throw interest.
The money also comes from private responsibility from public rights.
That's the cause of the losses of the filial Depfa.
It is a report that the state financials with the money provided for long-term projects have only financed a short period - which is now not more possible because of uncertainty in the markets.
In the first half of the year, the reserve of the capital in reality has fallen in 95 per cent, 2.37 million euros, and the amount of the capital was also laid down by 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
In comparison with the same period of the past year, the continuous income of financial investments and net benefits of financial operations fell to zero, the imputation income for debtors and some value tickets also led to the layer of the provisions of credit business over 70 per cent, in EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and many income refunds of the compensation costs of the ex-group Depfa and the refund of interests is the federal tax code and the business organized for consortial companies, the negative salt could accuse a deficit with approximately 16 per cent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former State financial at the beginning was lost in speculations with industrial credits for the immobile, which was a reason for the foundation of Aareal.
Since much money could not be gained with the financing of State projects, the Defa emphasizes intensively to the infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects by private investors, as well as States (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now the Real Estate Hypo has to make amortizations on the value of the branch that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of losses and profits of the group, it is very impressively said.
It's a fact that the dividends have cancelled.
They were canceled to two thirds for 2007.
After Depfa acquisition, the Real State Hypo became an important state and financial financial in the infrastructure area.
As the customer depth does not have, he, in comparison with other persons, is more dependent on refinancing in the interbancary market.
With the cheap of the investment and Property Lehman Brothers, what happened two weeks ago, the concession of interbancary credits was essentially decreased because the persons were increasing their liquidity.
Each year, the Real Estate Hypo needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a part of the Defa credit portfolio of its short-term refinancing measures.
The report of the Real Estate Report is covered with a credit the need for the financing of the group for a short time, and the company is assured of "the influence of the international monetary markets which are not essentially able to work"
Other sources say that the refinancing is guaranteed by these money until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, President of the Joint Directive of the Real Estate Hypo, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the pre-time.
The German Central Area and the Federal Institute of Financial Services Monitoring (BaFin) are part of the basis that the Hypo Real Estate Group's security is now.
That must be expected by the staff and the creditors.
However, because of the dynamic and impunity of the crisis there is no consistency.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for financing in its full volume.
But the contrary case cannot be excluded.
It was the voice that in the last Sunday hour the hour was still almost inevitable, so temporary salvation can also not be quiet for at least concerned.
The price of action falled to 75 per cent, 3.30 euros.
The loan courses, in contrast, are really good.
While priority debts are almost not changed, the position in the register of property is clearly low.
In particular, all the loans of the ex filial Württemberg Hypo are affected and the loans of their venture are based on 2009.
After the significant growth of the crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa affected by the Real Estate Hypo, the current value of its loans that previously were an investment for speculations should be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the governments, governments and governments who are less affected are still ready to support the system as long as it can be removed from pension amortisation within a period.
Or something will happen, which is not risked to imagine anybody-- the financial crisis will overcome in the next 15 months.
But when seeing the crossed news about the partial station, the security already in its border has become a justified hope.
That will be a reason, because the believers will pass the night without sleep, breaking the head on the decision on their isolation of enthusiasm.
The investors at short term may still put the final point and use the new transfer of the losses for the next payment of profits on the change in the future.
Sylvana and Bent secrets?-Box
When the first day, Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year girl, had to be presented at the Tachiban High School, girls began to laugh: Germany is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she accounts Japan.
"The first day in a college in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to college, I was afraid.
I live at Tokio's border at Kawasaki's address and I'm going to take a 40-minute to the High School Tachibana.
I had to find the way alone, for happiness I didn't lose.
It seems that the start of classes is not fixed as rigorous as in my house, in Baja Sajonia.
From the eightth morning the students come, at the nineth at least twenty begins a little with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before I started the class, I had touched me to present me.
In addition, I am not a person who speaks very pleasant in the public, especially before a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I put a old wallet of my mother of my anfitrione family and also a blus, calcetines to black skin chairs and black skin cups.
Then, so dressed, I put me on the pool and tried to say everything right: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I'm Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and in a week I'll be my birthday.
At this time, I was very happy because I had started studying this language for two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class have cut, dreamed and made signs and I have heard the word "kawaii" all the time.
I already knew my Mangas.
This belongs to the Japanese super-equipment vocabulary and means "mona, line"
Then I quickly kidnapped my place.
The girl at the side had a great smile, for her was a honor that the exchange girl had to sit at her side.
The rest of the class was very quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really awake.
Everyone talked at the same time, rejoiced and made many questions -- at the same time it was very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then, in the recreation, everyone took his Bentos.
My mother of my anfitrion family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else but buried German bread pieces.
He had raises with grass, small salts, pepino test and algas, fruit and something like tofu mass meat.
In most cases, I don't have any idea of what here in Japan.
The things are rare and they have a new sabor.
What's sure is that everything's very rich.
Then, maybe with an imprisonment of marine circles in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, the vines are not just a holiday.
Sometimes a girl prepares a very artificial festival for a boy and gives it in the hope that he can know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read in my Manga-Comics.
I have a lot of interest to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?", My friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokio to attend school a year.
Then I always answered:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally, since years ago, I prefer read Mangas.
To understand better comics and culture, one day I started studying a little of Japanese.
For me, I was absolutely sure that one day I'm going to travel there.
It's also because I have a flaco for tradition and habits.
Here they have a great value.
On the other hand, Japan is a country of recent technologies and trends, on the other hand, a hard, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I'm not still feeling lost here, though Tokio is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
The mouths also have feelings
It is said that a rate or a rate feeling the danger is running away, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the area of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control if they, behavior in the similar way of us, feel the same?
In a web magazine called "E" for many years, the awards of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers selected to the question What do you think is the truth without trying it?
I think animals have feelings and other states of conscience without me or someone else could try it until now, even though we can prove that others have conscience.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we deal with other species and include questions about feeling and generally about consciousness, we enter the unknown area because hardware does not match.
When a rate is in danger, he does the same as the other animals: the dead is made, fled or attacked.
People behave similarly, so some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain make it difficult to count our subject experience to the animals.
First, almost always they include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the front frontal bubble of the brain court (for their participation in the short memory and the executive functions leading to conduct).
This larger part is much more developed in the case of people than the other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal bubble of the brain courtship, including knowledge of whom we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even the human is different from the other primates.
Another particularity is located in the human language nature: As most of her experience is associated with the language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if the conscience would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it were, in many cases would be different from most of our conscience states.
Therefore, it is difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals works.
If that, like something interesting and subjective, does not let it be measured because it has the special hardware, and it does not be allowed to be analysed by our experiences, so your research presents us big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the conscious experience, but at the same time there is another aspect of the conscience that should be easier for scientific research.
Animal conscience processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short primates memory studies, especially in the example of visualisation.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed the essence is better to the neutral corrals of the conscience than to the causeal mechanisms: both can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal bubble of the brain cortez for the formation of visualization.
And what does that result for feelings?
I deal with the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is responsible for it, the same thing is happening with fear.
What we describe as fear is, therefore, a mental state in which we are when brain activity occupies a space of the defence system (or their consequences such as the body's reactions).
Because of this point of view, the feelings are very fixed by the brain cortez, which distinguishes to primates and especially to the human.
In view of the language nature, clasifications of final feelings continue because we can distinguish and classify states with the means of words and gramatics to be able to describe the states of others to usself.
For example, Antonio ́co, in contrast, thinks that feelings result from the simple activities of the parts of the brain cortez responsible for corporate feelings and the encampment tronco, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but is more focused on the encamp.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can be absolutely referring to different types and feelings.
For theoretical reasons, I can't go against it, but I think it doesn't.
Pakseep arguments that what mouths and men feel as fearful, it may also feel in two cases like this: But how can it be controlled if mouths and men behave likewise feel the same?
Looking at the danger of a cowboy runs away, but why is he afraid?
I think that the likeness of the behavior still does not prove the similarity of experience.
That is true that neuronal comparison helps: mouths and men have similar encamps, cookers in the contrary have no at least one brain.
Is it the throat of the head that is responsible for feelings?
Even when it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of mouse?
I think mouths and other mammifers, maybe also cookers (Who knows that?), have feelings.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behaviour of mouths and emotional feelings because their feelings are fundamentally different from us (for human conscience refers to special circuits and languages).
In any case, the progress in the area of neurology is expected to measure the same way of mouths and men.
As I don't investigate the language and my mouth consciousness, as well as feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see more than mine in my owns, but I prefer to go forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of the EUFA Platini: Grace term for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the suppleant Prime Minister, said that preparations would soon be made under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government views the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as the proof of confidence in Ukraine to organize the European campaign together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnistie for our country.
Now the work is going to begin, and there is much to do in both countries."
The time of building and rebuilding of stadiums, streets, hotels and ports in the neighborhood countries is cool.
The number of stadiums may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't make more time.
Now we have to work with great speed," said the President of a Ucrania Grigorij Surkis association.
"The EUFA will not remove our eyes."
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
After many scandals, the Olympical Committee of Poland suspended the management of the PZPN Polish Association and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee was gathered at the request of the Miroslaw Drzewicki Deport Minister.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewicki said to the Poland news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured the President of the EUFA Platini that preparation for the European campaign of 2012 will not suffer."

Distress of Denis Quid
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked in an interview on private life - and she had problems with her ex-married man: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star designed her ex-married as a adulter.
He's angry and contradicted.
The late war of the two roses in the former park of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show a disadvantaged fight among them.
The last week in an interview with the magazine and InStyle Meg Ryan for the first time spoke about the reasons of marriage failure: "Dennis was a lot of time fair to me, and that was very painful."
She assumed the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of the private things was Ryan's work with the pressure for his new movie "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to the designation of him as a philosophical husband was clear: "This is unexpected that Meg counts the story of our relationship in another version," said the 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it is very "plaudable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember the pain and changes in public, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is married again and a short time a father of them.
And thus ends with his statements by giving a statement: "Be as if my life continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
The prices of aircraft and hotels are lower
In the first half of 2008, aircraft billets and pernoctations in Europe were better compared to the last year.
It is a current study, the aircraft billets in Germany have become worth even 50 percent.
Aeroplane billets and pernoctations in hotels have been made rebuilt - these are the results of a study from the provider of American Express travel services and financial services.
The company has analysed its reservation data from the first half of 2008 and after the increase in prices in the first trimester, a large change in the second semester was shown.
After a lot of years the prices on the hotel market continued to increase, the pernoctations were made small.
In comparison with the last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased by average to 6,9 per cent between January and March.
From April to June, prices have already been reduced to 3,6 per cent comparing the last year.
The trends were more sensitive in Paris and Rome, where the travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
It is American Express, the reason for that was the debilitated dollar course, which was the cause of "the interests of tourists and travelers have decreased."
The reduction of hotel prices is also much more noted in financial centres such as Francfort or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannóver, Colonia or Stavanger.
In Norway, hotel prices increased to 26.3 per cent and thus buy a record in Europe.
In the first trimestres, air billet prices also showed the trends up:
As a result of the increase in cherosen prices, the travelers of the Economy class had to pay for a average term of 7,1 per cent more than in 2007, long distance flights were even more charged to 29,2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of the aircraft billets in the Economy class, compared to the previous trimestre, were reduced by average to 12.5 percent, but the changes of prices for the Business Class and the First Class were small.
In Germany, price change was more significant than in other European countries:
From January to February, the prices increased to 11,9 in the second semester decreased to 23,6 percent.
The prices for national flights in Germany were even reduced to half.
The cause of price change is, of a part, the increase in the flexible economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the travel market with the plane, the request is down.
On the other hand, there is a great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty to liberalize the air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-lucking distance flights in aircompanys, as well as a large number of air companions that in the first half of 2008 were stated in cebra - only in Europe were 24 aircraft companies.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a gol and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes leader.
Luhukay of Borussia is still not going to make the gol decimopressed.
Christoffer Klein has very well presented the strong territory of the player of the National Selector Marko Martin.
The Gladbach player begins to play late and failed to do a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by repairing the event, it could be read clearly of his responsibility.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second gol," he said, "Hermann Rieger's cabin in the Hamburg stadium.
I have nothing special in the catacombs, the rest time ended, and most of the presents were again on their sites.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV physiotherapeutic, enjoying very great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
Therefore, his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol, the assistant trainer, had the head and lifted his fingers in a sign of accommodation.
Cornelius is a brother of Martin Jol, the main trainer of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second gol!
But that wasn't done.
"Today, it wasn't all pleasant to see," he added after Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wanted to have it "better relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg must thank Mladen PetProperty (11) with his head impact; and also the situation that the Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"This was a sucking victory," said Martin Jol summary.
This Monday, Hamburg's SV will fulfil its 121 years.
The Sabbath the spectators had already celebrated their own, the heaven to Â on the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
In the presence of the parts of the table's qualifications are more corresponding to the binding's velocity than to the domination of its HSV.
The kip with its obligated players later like the Neves and Silva Brazilians, the Goleator Pet ։ As well as Jansen who has been removed from FC Bayern needs time to join, but the kipo can't yet handle with its success.
"We need more of feeling and dribbling," Jol requests.

Dark material affects the traictory of space sounds
Since many years a mystery phenomenon causes researchers desconcertation: The Dark Material has affected the speed of space songs during the so called gravitational assistance to maniobra.
Experts fear that the theory of the Relativeness of Albert Einstein cannot be so correct.
The "Ulysses" spatial sondae passed almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because fuel tuberculouses are hel·se’s now threatened to death in the cold.
A mysterious phenomenon for years ago, anomalie during gravitational assistance to maniobra, causes the disagreement between researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a manihop of the traictory of space sons while they get a acceleration using the energy of the gravity field of a planet, such as the Earth.
This allows space sounds to cover fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space sondae used this physical truck as did the sun of the Ulysses Sun.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave by 100 percent as it is expected is the venerable law of gravity.
More frequent speed irregularities.
Increasingly, the songs have greater or less speed.
Physicians could not explain this effect until now .
It was called anomalie during gravitational assistance to maniobra.
Some experts are afraid that even the general theory of the Relativeness of Albert Einstein, which describes the strength of attraction of the material for space curvature, cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the physical and § of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton, believes solely now as before Einstein didn't confund and explained anomalie during the gravitational assistance with the assistance called Dark Material, in which the astronomes remained in the universe.
"The reason for anomalie may be the Dark Material that can also be very close to the earth," he wrote.
Researchers in the universe know the existence of the Dark Material only for ten years.
It seems to have the force of attachment and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Material is, in contrast, completely inside what means that it doesn't send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no light.
The estimates of the scientists the Dark Material are at least one five of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists in Egypt are free
As confirmed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, after ten days in the hands of sequestrators, the tourists in Egypt must be released.
The sequencers of Sudan have made millions of the rescue.
Six sequestrators must be killed in a tiroteo during the release.
Five Germans are cut off in south of Egypt.
The negotiations relating to the rescue have already been started.
The Germans always fall on the point of attention of the sequencers.
The WE日 ONLINE reports the most important cases.
The European tourists in Sahara are often free.
The same information provides the State Egyptian television, the Arabic Al-Arabia television and the Italian media.
After the news on release in the Italian Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Ministry of External Affairs, confirmed the release: "Our companions and other rehens are free.
'Now we control your health status,' said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian, as well as eight Egyptians are well and are in security, reporting the stateal Egyptian television.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the wilderness are on the road to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible is the reasons for a Tyroteo before the release of the rehenes: The descriptions of a Egyptian security guard were ready to end with the sequestre, but the Sudan army immediately killed six sequestrators.
"The problem was solved.
"They were in accordance with the ransom," said the guard.
It was only to "receive the rehenes" when it immediately came to "this surprise".
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers killed six sequestrators and two of them were arrested in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
Sequencers have made from Germany the redemption for six million euros; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the rehens.
The journal "El Masri El Jom", repeated to a German mediator, reported that the release was repeated because the sequestrators were afraid of their security.
The report is reported by sequencers are intended to release female rehenes after receiving the redemption.
The men had to be arrested until the travelers had a safe way to flee.
The German ambassador in Cairo 日 takes the position regarding this report.
"He led to self-sufficiency"
It is the court, years of abus for his father brought a woman to kill himself.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years of prison after he accepted eight insecure offences.
The Royal Court of Truro, in a research study, knew that he had regularly attacked his daughter Stephanie Randle when the girl was five to seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a conference role: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court recognized that Mrs Randle was suicide in its home of Mutley in Plymouth, 1 April 2007, at the age of 34 years.
At the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to spend her and sell her eyes before taking her sexual acts, while her mother was working on a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter was transferred to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Mrs. Randle, who used a large part of his time working as a voluntary for the National Trust, was abused by the abuse he had been infected two times a week.
In 2006, the fiscal Ramsey Quaife refused to the court what some friends of Mrs Rande had said about it, that after being a great surfist and cyclist, he now seemed "emotionally dead," as if he had "rejected life."
In April 2007, his true father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in its apartment of Plymouth.
Ms. Rande should have killed herself with a plastic box.
Mr. Randle replied to his daughter's father, who wrote a letter of confession that was concluded, saying, "I'd just cut her up and sight her eyes.
It was never a sexual offense.
I feel responsible for your death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise, "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim must have been a wonderful experience, especially when I was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim has been removed from his own life.
More clearly, it is that if she hadn't done it, the question would probably not have been completed in the courts."
And he added, "I noticed the effect that the description made by the father and Stephanie's mother was abused over her daughter for the years.
Honestly she could have had a promised, successful and happy future."
A official loaded by data loss
The BBC was informed that a officer of the Office, who had given some secret documents on the train in June, will be accused of the Law on official secrets.
The man, on the road by the Defence Minister, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is probably the less serious charge in law and does not provide any indication of the purpose of crime.
The BBC responsible for Defense Frank Gardner refused that the consequence had come as a surprise for many in the English administration.
"They thought that it was an internal matter between the Defence Minister and the Office," he said.
The employer, which cannot be appointed, is loaded under Section 8.1 of the Law, the clause referring to the protection of information.
The Real Justice Service noted that the officer should be accused of the Metropolitan Police, due to the highly sensitive performance of his work in the Secret Service Committee.
The documents provided secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately after his home to a secret place.
Construction companies are the B&B price
In Greece, building companies could be acquired of a price of more than 80,000 litres of sterline after the rescue/scape of Bradford and Bingley.
The Government actually provided 14 billion dollars in order to protect the depths of the 2.6 million ahorrors.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies who use the money of the abortors, including 59 building companies.
The Director-General of the Construction Society (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that companies and their members must pay
Eventually, 14 billion loan should be reimbursed after Bradford and Bingley's hypoteques are resumed.
Nevertheless, the interests in the internal are charged each year to the 700 financial undertakings holding deposits.
The Financial Service Indemnisation Plan confirmed the BBC that 59 building companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions who have behaved with generosity ... are called to pay today the price of institutions that have been much less decent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the deposits and that mediation companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will rise to 450 thousand dollars staring in 2009.
This includes that companies will have to recover 81,000 litres of sterline in order to acquire the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Trade Association of Construction Societies, declared to the BBC that this situation is unjust.
"It is humiliating that institutions who have behaved in the growth of the immobiliary market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less decent."
The BSA is, no data indicates the failure of any company since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the next weeks to see what options there are to protect building companies and its members against what could be a relevant price," Mr. Cole said.
The interest returned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interests, which may be almost two times more.
Since building companies are mutuous organizations and have no õists, their members will end inevitably paying the price, either less or less interests in their awards.
The price of milk rises from five pence per litre
The inhabitants of Jersey's street will have to pay more for their milk.
The journal Jersey Dairy announced that the highest price of milk products will increase by a additional five pens the litre since the next month.
It is the second increase in the price of this year, after an increase in two pences in February and after investigations carried out by a consultative company.
Tradeers may decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February, it was in 2002.
Rejects freedom under confidence to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court of Bangladesh has made the request for freedom under confidence for the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that it can be led to prison when she returned to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him the freedom of 50 million tax extortion ($ 729.700) to a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various corruption accusations to its charge.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next weeks, but its party, the Awami Liga, has made that the Government of the country, militaryly supported, leads to her first full freedom.
The responsibles say that while given to her the conditional freedom to go to the foreign and receive medical treatment, it is not now clear what the terms of your release are or if it will be able to stay free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that they will make a call before the Supreme Court against the Order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court of Justice is the request for freedom under confidence for Sheikh Hasina, insisting that he could not obtain freedom under confidence because he was already in treatment in the foreigner under conditional freedom," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're going to interfere with an appointment against the Order of the Supreme Court."
Her defenses argued that she needed freedom under confidence to return to her country from the foreign and prepare for the elections of December.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his patriarch after 17 October, what a leader of the Awami Liga rejected last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, supported by the military, adopted the power, but was released in June to go to the foreigner and received medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia have all the charges they are accused.
Fears for the campaign against the poliomielitis in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the United Nations - have not been able to use a recent antipoliomielite vaccination campaign due to the violence of the Taliban.
The last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provincies of the country.
The organization reports that children could not reach in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A United Nations carrier said that despite the promises made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or prevented thousands of officers while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenges in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenges in the Competition Committee after the decision that the company forced to reduce its participation in the ITV rival radio diffusion.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competitive Court that it will need to reduce its participation by 17,9% in ITV under 7,5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests prevent competition and allow their disloyal influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought his action package in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, in buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office Anti Monopolio reported that the acquisition of the participation in ITV by BSkyB had doubts about the independence of ITV, and encouraged the Competition Committee to open an investigation.
All, including the chief of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and official regulators, were at purchasing.
BSkyB, recommended that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate medicine, particularly why, said BSkyB, would have granted its voting rights.
New research in the advocates' appointment
The Secretary-General of the United States has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the exhibition of nine statuniten lawyers in 2006.
The reason was that the General Inspector of the Department of Justice criticized the action by the administration officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, the legislators and the former manufacturer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear of the removal of the lawyers for political reasons.
The Special Provider Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the investigated officers have lying to researchers in order to prevent justice.
"The claims of possible criminal conduct have not been completely investigated or solved," was reported by the General Prosecutor Glenn Bellas.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the designation of a special prosecutor with the power to force the witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion eats when nine statuniten lawyers were removed from their charges by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the Department motivated the decision suggesting that the lawyers had been dismissed by lower performance.
But later, the lawyers had not been evaluated worse than others of their colleagues, and many observers had concluded that the disfellowships would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers concerned had worked in the persecution of some of the Republicans, members of the High Profile of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate electoral fraud claims against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and hurt the cases of the government
and can be dispedited at any time, but not by political reasons.
The next Chief of the Department of Justice, the General Prosecutor Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for the exhibitions, rejected its position.
A certain number of other officers of the Department of Justice did the same.
The report of the General Prosecutor is very critical about the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and he subscribes how he had a "principal responsibility" for the emergency, which "abdived" of his leadership position and was "notablely non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officers, including Karl Rove, the former Bush partner, were criticized because they did not cooperate with research.
The epic of Meat Loaf of a lot of honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honoured in the Q Awards by its epic hell Bat Out of Hell.
The song, who will collect the special premium next week in the ceremonie that will happen in London, said that getting this recognition will be "a honor".
The song, which spent nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group is carrying out candidatures for the premiums of this year and makes the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-chef of the magazine Q, said, "There are some songs that pass time and gender, and Bat Out of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, repeats a excellent vocal capacity like that used by Meat Loaf.
A instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hino.
The song was first known as one in the United Kingdom in 1979, and it came to be number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained about nine years in classifications and came to sell more than 40 million copies around the world.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in the past years, including a chirurgical operation for its heart arithmy in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, a strong laringitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Afterward, he had a kiss in his voice cord.
Dark road of the city, often lived and maybe ready to sell
The city of New York accounts with thousands of adventure, bullevary, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply serve.
However, many people, including veterinarian taxists and local residents of long date, are difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard about this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and is extended to the North of the First Calle – before I found the Second Calle - between the Bowery and the Second Avenida.
This street, more or less than 30 feet width and 120 feet long, is like a powder road more than one active way.
There are no signs.
It is almost impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has wonderers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company who recently built lujo buildings in the First Calle
that wants to restore Extra Place and create a patrol in the tents and bottles that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirators include the old-date neighbors who commented to be grateful by the truck carrier simply because it is one of the last remains of the block past before the nearby of buildings.
However, the Department of Accommodation, Preservation and Development of the city, which has the control of the street, has no interest in putting it.
In the Committee on Venice for the use of the land this month, the representatives of the Avalon Agency have made a proposal to buy the street.
However, the Committee, predicting that the street would remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented in the next month, as Susan Stetzer said, the Community chairman.3.
"The city is property today of very few spaces and we would like to continue putting extra Place," Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced a few months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, in the hope of accommodation of spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came for the first time during this month
but Michele de Milly, a carrier of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he didn't necessarily want to possess it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned road and the possibility of converting it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city.
Seth Donlin, a carrier of the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire for the city to sell the street and noted that the mission of the Agency was the development of the property more than the management of it.
In comparison with its more coloring around, the Bowery's, Extra Place has left a bullet in the history.
Some believe that he obtained his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great property finger was divided between his children and this east land franja was not recalled by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the penk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street may be better known by the graphics of the establishment that goes out in the Ramones 'Rocket to Russia' album.
"The environment was magn," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the graphics in November 1976.
"It was filled with bullets, clothes and barriles pieces, cardles, sheets, yards."
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about East Village's aburgement, have been opposed to the idea of selling extra Place, argumenting that public goods, even modesty, should continue to be public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, almost without change, a race of the city that should be tute.
Jeremias Moss, leading a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has provided a part of a conversation of the city story about Extra Place, published by the new Yorker journal in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little hard and unexpected road, dark also for the day and marked by oxided and contraventure ports, with old weekly magazines over the channels."
With a few speechs, the street looked more or less like the same in a recent afternoon.
A rate was covered by the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter the CBGB and now collected a lush clothes.
Graffiti on the walls and a empty bird bottle of nearly 22-oz were near a new football of rejected magazines.
Some passengers said that they were rarely looking at the Extra Place, but suggested that you could be given a lot.
Mr. Fields, on his part, noted that some people understood the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I've passed the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, humble and blind places."
The debate on bilinguism: investment in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on biln education.
Lance T. Izumi, an elder associated with studies on the Californian and study director of the Public Research Institute, is co- > of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice".
True calling to the Spanish voters is a difficult business.
The proposals for education made by Barack Obama are the example of this.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "the African-American and Latin students have significantly less probabilities of graduating than white students," and this is a very certain consideration.
In order to combat such differences in the events of the education, Obama's education plan is particularly aware, among other things, of the "vilin transition education" for the English students.
However, the question open for Mr Obama is whether the commitment of bilin education, which prefers education in different languages than English, is effective to cancel the distance in the final results.
Let us, for example, take Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognised primary school in the east region of Los Angeles.
At this school, most students are Spanish and family with low rent:
More than one third of the students, many of whom recently arrived, are being entitled English.
However, an incredible 100 percent of the fourth year students has been positively evaluated in the 2008 Mathematics review.
and almost a strange 93 percent has dominated the English and art test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr Obama.
The Sixth Street School highlights the review and practice, the constant evaluation of competences and does not tolerate any excuses.
In addition, and here, Mr. Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, the main of the Sixte Calle, the approach of the school for the Instruction of English to students is in the "total interest".
Intress in English means the almost use of the language in the treatment of the instruction contents.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to the bilin education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this last that came from Mexico and that if you enter the school 12 months later, you wouldn't be able to collect what it was."
"Function," he said, "We think it works."
Will Mr Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replica for other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the response, but the idea of politicians of their party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have been long-term defensors of the Billin Education) and its constant support for the Billin Education is dark to predict Mr Obama's response.
Although the immigrants must be English, Mr Obama has recently trivialized the issue, allowing people to stop concerning the legislation that is written only in English.
And instead, he said, "You must make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr Obama really wants to improve the system and close the laguns, he should consider carefully the models of education that work well, more than from them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls brushfully after the renewed economic fears
The price of petroleum is drasticly reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Great oil action decreased from 7 per cent, reaching 99.80 dollars the barryl in the morning negotiation in New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has lowered more than 20 dollars per barrile since the last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the markets of basic products have been cut off by the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a couple of powerful Uracans in the Mexico Golf.
After achieving a maximum of $145,29 per barryl in July, the prices had fallen almost $90 per barryl at the beginning of this month, before returning, once again, due to the great uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety was made by the investors, once again, on Monday, despite the leaders of the Congress who said have reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in the history.
The news was seen ashamed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far away from ending.
The evolution occurred in the last episode of the mergement process, confirms that Citigroup will buy Wachovia Corporation's operations, is what the Government said this month.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European Fortis financial conglomerated.
Analysis in Barclays Capital said, in the weekend, the negotiations that led to the redemption agreement "seem to haven't been able to reactivate the market feeling."
As the economic situation is deteriorated, it is expected to reduce the application of basic products, including petroleum.
"The prospects for world equity, the interest and change rate will be more uncertain," the Deutsche Bank's analyses wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products cannot escape from this account.
From the prospect of products, our most acute concern is the evaluation of whether the American virus will be spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
Analysis of the age has reduced its expectations for the next year, such as the consumption of petroleum low because of the growth in the economic growth and the reduction in the price of petroleum and gas is of 20 per cent for 2009.
Second footnote: equip sets record
After having passed, during the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw the things are developed in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without annotation into a game of disinflation.
"I never saw anything like that," Ellis recommended.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Cardinals had played under the shadows of the clouds.
At this moment, the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles performing a target of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect pre-award for a afternoon, in which the development of the relationship between players had a big step towards the next.
Favre found Coles for two more meta in the room, one of them when a cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps they went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been big, independent of what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were undertaken in prison, the defense of the Cardinals was misleading the Kurt Warner quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a train walking and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric ́ith asked another step and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was committed to the lack of Warner.
In the last turn, the missing obliged by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardenals had taken the position with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-year bag to win a final 34-0.
It's the biggest points that the Jets never did in a room.
The Team Traider, Eric Mangini, ask you to describe the crazy at this moment, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter? "
When he answered both - the Jets allowed 21 points without response in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can say that I liked much more the second quarter than the territory.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Dissatisfied Gebsselassia encamps its world record
Once again, Haile Gebsselassie of Ethiopia has shown because many consider it the biggest corner of the history, overwhelming its own world record in the Berlin maraton this Sunday and become the first person able to run the career of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the lanch carriage at 2:03:59, Gibslassie has destroyed its previous record at 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebsselassie has established the world record number 26 in a career of a impressive length, so he has established a world campaign or a global record for any distance from the contrarreloj to the maraton.
Last month, Gebsselassie has not participated in the olympical maraton in Beijing, fearing - maybe too alarming, in retrospective - that the air pollution will increase its problems with asma.
Instead, he was pointed to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sole and with 48 degrees at the start of the carrier, 55 degrees at the end - Gebsselassie wined this Sunday, using in the middle of 4 min. 43 seconds per milk.
Since travelers like Gebsselassie and Paul Tergat de Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa de Brazil wined in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory of the last Sunday, Gebsselassie told the journalists who had suffered calamities in the pantorrilla two weeks ago and that he had lost a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension left you fresh, not oxided.
"I'm very happy," Gebsselassie said to the journalists.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but at the end everything was good."
The atlete has been subject to some critics - especially in Kenya, the African-Eastern Rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much their carriers, in general, avoiding meeting with many stars of the world maraton, based on the marks as if it was a carrier track, and putting the records in front of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not decrease the size of the ability of Gebsselassie as a corridor.
This Sunday, at the walk of four kinesians, Gebsselassie reached half of the career at 1:02:04.
Two elite corridors of Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to defeat Gebsselassie after their marks had decreased.
But a little before three miles of the target, Gebsselassie took a last impulse to separate from Kwambai, who ends second; at 2:05:36, improveing his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi came to the third place at 2:07:48.
In the female career, Irina Mikitenko, who was born in Kazakhstan, but now German citizen, completed a notable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record at 2:15:25.
The early past, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise and wined London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not participate in the Beijing Games because it was described as a lease in the bed, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set her best personal record in almost five minutes in the third marathon that runs.
He made a smart calculation career, leaving a quarter of kinesical and ethical corridors to make head and then recover them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia wined the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finali of the third at 2:25:01.
In a apart city, the proof of the color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park on the theme of the Great Orlando, a few miles from the haltant, rude and colosal city, is a quiet people, where the proud and complications of African experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first city that is completely inhabited by black in the country and the place of Zora Neale Hurston's fingerprint, is not as simple as she described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good natives, many guayabes, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of peregrination.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the year Zora! Firry in Eatonville to tax a mastership to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem's Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage through its inclusion in Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Scripture Project of the Depression Session - is still a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the years “30, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that the rural black in Florida often resisted to keep their true ideas with the white man, that "is so little about us and that he doesn't know what's going to lose."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on race issue, many are still careful about foreigner.
"We are very careful about how our story is counted," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a resident of the whole life and a member of the oldest church of the city.
"He must be right."
Eatonville has always been defined a trionfo and fighting paradox.
At the same time, it is a history model of black and a community of nearly 2.400 people living under a double level of poverty of the national average.
It's a literary center, but also a repared example of the Southern rural culture - sometimes denounced, other loving - that was born from slavery in America.
It's not wondering if those who live here are proud and reserved at the same time.
And the concern for the image of Eatonville really empire by Zora, as here nobody calls you Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her native city to the world to its deep books in dialect as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the leading of Florida transformed the city, only out of the Road 17, a road that runs to the centre of Florida often towards the history of black and human drama.
Having ciment face as much in life as in the life, Mrs. Hurston brought her readers to the property tent of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then in more private areas.
"Beside the road to the left," he wrote, " there's the modern public school maron with its white finished, its well-keeping gardens and game pieces, care for Howard Miller, as he can only read and write."
She also refers to the new man of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sell drinks of any kind and everything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston relates to Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with analfabetism, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't do that.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the contrat.
"Zora described it as well," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the girls Johnson that Mrs. Hurston immortal was quoting men who were sing songs without color about her beautifulness.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a living excentric that often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, he did it without prejudice in a great Chevrolet, smoking and carrying bags into a city that still is proud of clothing with dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many were sarcastic.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," follows Mr. Franklin.
But, added, it balanced in her shelter in a back piece with view on the Sable Lake, where Ms. Hurston was probably baptized, " she never left too much time."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer printing.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have seen it.
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only color woman at the Barnard College in the years ’ 20 ’, it was buried in anonymous tube in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he was living.
In Eatonville there were no large memorandum ceremonies, nor large public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her inheritance was understanded," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrappedi in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain rotation came in the 1980s.
The officers of the Orange Condado wanted to put a road of five cars to the city to submit the Kennedy Boulevard, the road of two main cars of the work community.
The expansion of the area of Orland has already been empowered by the Interstatal 4 to the west border of the city.
The proposal came on a moment when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of his history.
The strengthened integration, among other things, had ended him with the idiomatic isolation of the community.
In the ‘50s, the fight for racial mixture led hatred about the community.
"In that season, a group of white boys, they went through the city by bringing narrows and every thing against people who were sitting near," Mr. Franklin said.
"They also killed a girl once.
They threw him against a car sandy."
In a letter of 1955 to Mrs. Hurston wrote to the journal The Orlando Sentinel, criticing the strong integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "instead of honoring my race."
R The residents today say that the desegregation of schools, positive in some aspects, has debilitated Eatonville cohesion and has deceived their youth's confidence.
"The black kids were usually used to be breathed - I remember this – was used to break the teacher on the morning and night," N.Y. Nath ։ The daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-fruitless organization.
This was, added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't going to blame your teacher because it was white - there's a cultural breath there," said Ms. Nath.
Civil rights, however, helped to create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over the tops, as she did, with boyant, trust and lines such as: "How can anyone refuse my company's pleasure?
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tube of Mrs. Hurston and eaten struggle to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, a claimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the libraries, re-transporting it into the American canons.
The road project came right at the time the most lucky daughter of Eatonville went back under the reflectors.
And this time, the old neighbors of Mrs. Hurston saw her as a salvator.
In 1988, the community eat planning a ferry for Mrs. Hurston to show what the conduit could destroy with that road.
Thousands of admirators arrived to the in-ural event two years later, and every January, many return to celebration.
After several years, the court has abandoned its proposal of road.
"The resurrected idea of the road on five ways would have been put into what you would call curvature speed, a real civic proud," said Ms. Nath.
Mrs. Boyd said it simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory on the road project has helped to change the picture of the same city.
People outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who eats to come to the church from here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National History Register in 1998.
A new library (arriving the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a reavimented and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomalie in Florida: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, sometimes you can feel like in a street of the past under a soil rain, in a small city as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 per cent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who are looking for the story of Eatonville, of their meaning, often are still carefully treated.
An advanced permission is necessary to do most interviews, and some things - such as walls in the oldest church of Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men who work in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a strong and convinced teacher who has deficiency for the red red, are still afraid that his island community can be misinterpreted.
And however, as the Hurston festival has expanded, there has also been a higher level of birthal orgasm.
Young people, in particular, intend to see Eatonville as Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beautifulness, and all problems, not better, not worse, and also other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, work, stupid and mixture.
It is a sincere civil sense that can be heard in the vote of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who has planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work at the local government or by the Department of Police, which he said may need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two of the 11 years of Winter Park, seem to have been described correctly.
"The majority of people, if they are going here, will have to think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other," Alondra Kenon says after going to church in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your story, it's a very pleasant city."
Here, in New York, everyone talks about funds.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed far away from the kioscos and the gigantic television screens in Times Square, they would not be able to find themselves in the eye of the Uracan.
They could never imagine that behind the glass box of the wooden offices that are above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers that monopolise New York are quoted with the worst "day of the Office" since the bathroom of 1929.
Children for delivery to house continue to resume their metal cars for the tea to the stairs and carry out muffin bands for the dishun meetings.
Latin men are still arranging between buildings of charged apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 excentric printing trucks locked to a yugo at → of their hobbys. Official workers are still waiting in school for their food to take from the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between the 4 and the 7 in the labour days.
The employees, however, expect to cook their bagel on the sales carriers, but it is impossible to find a taxi between the four and the five afternoon in the weekdays.
I looked like there was no absolute crisis, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimist previsions that exist, I decided to open a new account of awards.
Although I had calculated the time necessary for the operation to match the quietness of the end of the afternoon in my local office of JP Morgan Chase, a school of more or less than 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the worker's window, to remove its efficiency or make a deposit, but in front of the customer's service, where all life clients order their cheque talents, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's large storages and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people predicted me, I was informed later by Starr, my "certain personal bank", and they were in school for the same reason as I.
On the contrary to me, they have already removed their refrigerators from the smallest places in places where they had conmutated them, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the State Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called aeroplane associations (small as a building society), from credit unions and from their national town's boxes whose boxes only work within the state of ownership and who say to treat customers as their family.
Earlier year, 15 of these acts have quietly failed.
In the last days, Washington Mutual, an active $327 billion, entered in the cheap, and as the Neo-Yorkins were guided to their homes on Thursday for weekend end, another, Wachovia, with some 440 billion depths, he was looking for a ransom buyer.
The workers of the offices and tents that remained before me, fearing another collapsed, were transferring their money to a place which is considered a safe resource, which is doing most of the rescues in Wall Street.
New York-based persons have become experts in the last weeks of funds.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking by telephone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the defected, and its executive director of afflicted aspects, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they were distracted from the inactivity of a colleague.
And Lyn, fifty-five, and something that I've conserved in uniform of my apartment block, has changed the normal round of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my purchases at the tent.
He told me, after my visit to the public, that "I now have all my benefits in the funds of the monetary market.
Conmutation is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim tubs profaned at the time Austria approaches the de
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left side of the extreme party for the freedom of Austria and Philip Dewinter Belgian, participated in the extreme party of Vlaams Belang, takes part in a manifestation to present the organization "Citizens against Islamization" in Amberes on June 17 January 2008.
They bring trading signals representing the mixtures with a red line that translates.
Police is guilty of extreme extremists for the profanation of a Muslim cementary in Austria, the same weekend as the political parties of the extreme of the country's general elections.
More than 90 tubs were severely hurt in the Traun cementary, near Linz, at some time between Friday and tonight, where the police thinks it was a organized action.
The criminals struck Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the tubs, but researchers believe that this could have been done by the purpose of hiding the real reasons of the extremists impulsed by hate against the Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear that the incident was in some way related to elections.
A carrier of the local islamic community said they were "profundly shocked" by the news of the profanation, which came to the Muslims when the month Ramadán ended.
Meanwhile, Austria was preparing for an introspective round after the turn to the deeper in the Parliamentary elections of yesterday.
The two extreme parties of the extent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on the anti-immigration vehement and some of their slogans were considered genophobs by the critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party, who wined more than 18 percent of the vote, made his campaign against head and burk, and also expressed his opposite to the foods considered related to Islam.
At its last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brothership" to prevent Islam's surrounding.
Both parties are trying to build mixtures and minerals, argumenting that they are symbols of the current islamizing policy in Austria and Europe.
Inquiries and analysis once after elections, which have confirmed the extreme of the country as the strongest political block, indicate that the change has occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel in the foreign for Gary Glitter
The courts have made Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star of sexual abuse of children, to travel to France and Spain.
The judges made Glitter a six-month report after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain to France.
Kent's police formed the trip to travel to the foreigner last Thursday after the judges had produced the tests of the previous sentences of Glitter for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend audience in the Ashford Magisters Judge in Kent, but was represented by a lawyer Corker Binning.
A carrier of the Service of Justice said: "The Court of Justice of the Ashford Magistrates in Kent, on June 25 September, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travels to the foreigner as to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities who wanted to travel to the foreigner, in being under the register of sexual crimes.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel to the foreigner for more than three days
and it is also necessary to communicate to the police the scheduled date for seven days of exit.
Kent's police said he wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible place that Glitter stops in the court.
A police carrier of Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or in the foreign.
A police carrier of Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or in the foreign.
"From our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"The protection of Kent's inhabitants is the main concern of Kent's police and we work in east to monitor the conduct of sexual crimes recorded in the chair and to reduce at least any risk that can exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after last 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, with age between 10 and 11 years.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
Yet, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to passe over passenger control and finally fled to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also rejected the entry and he flew from return to Bangkok, where the Thai and the immigration officers insisted for returning to Great Britain.
He probably arrived to the 3th Heathrow Terminal on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbri's Master Court, western London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as sexual criminal.
Glitter had been incarcered in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 by poison of child abuse images.
A source of the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jcumbith, the Ministry of Interior, was quiet and rejoiced to know that they had made Glitter travel to France and Spain.
"Capter to the teacher out of scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Fotograph
No tacons, no flights, no aliens.
The essence of the great teachers of the flamenc, quick from the concentration in the interpretation, to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one side, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Unseparable except in the intimity, in those moments agencies to the public, when finding the privacy of a gest, the depth of a furnished look or the expressivity of some hands, disappointed because they are not going out on the scene.
The German Günther Bauer changes the theatricity of some places on scene with songs, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the graph collects the specific icongraph of the flamenc from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of the Flamenca Photography, the exhibition "respects the international importance of the flamenco, more than every day," explains the Creator, who claims that "Flamenco-people" can be people of anybody but, seeing photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical artist images in the scenario.
These people retrated "in the street" are artists of sending on a scene of passion, trial, joy... capturing the public.
To catch the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos from the scenario.
Take your personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to catch with the camera the personality of the big flamenc."
With the sabor of the festival "Cante de les Minas", Bauer empeʹ in 1.997 a long journey to treat the songs, guitarists or dancers with a map camera.
They are retracted that, due to the selection of cameras and materials, the classic graphics are revised.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classic base of the image, confiding it in modernity, the idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolutes and appears every day."
It is not the action of dance, song or touch in it, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captures with his art to the public.
The search of a meeting with the essence, with the dude that it is made in a way of feeling, being and being sound and have been the constant of this work presented in the El Fotomata gallery these days.
Known figures of the flamenc such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seven photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of the flamenc, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the contracts expressed in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's retraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Sportart Projects of Veterinary sports" ("Sportart Project").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the dictionary admits that "I love to treat people, to know them and to enter an instant in their life, is a long or short instance.
I think it's the most difficult gene within the graphics.
You find yourself or you're with people, persons, sometimes you don't know, or you just leave a few minutes to get the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a ́official, I always try to make my ideas real."
This collection of retraits of the current flamenco that leads by the title "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Galeria El Fotomata, which is shown at number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Lameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa believes that the news that writes is "a fear"
It is emerging in places that he still doesn't know and turns on unknown matters, but yet, Mario Vargas Llosa is started to take the new project on which he works, a newspaper who has a protagonist to Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazonia.
The always favorite to the Nobel Price of Literature admitted yesterday in its pass by the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that you today care is "is a fear" and that "all indicates that you should not write" the newspaper.
"If I was smart, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and hope to end it once," he concluded in its intervention at the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that you have seen through the city of Aquaeducto to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the dogs" was one of the figures of these figures of the third and of the word festival and fulfilled the proofs.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Price Hay Festival for being the most voted writer of the participants - an ancient and ancient "Our mutual friend", of Dickens-, filled the forest of the teater Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before himself a public delivered to whom it was made very short the time when Peruan, with a wonderful and great memory of humor, repeated how he was born in him his literary vocation, resulting from the "extraordinary aventure" of the "place to read" and "life more than he lived"; how it writes of "disciplined" to supplicate his "inspiration failure" with an intense documentation work, correcting and reacting much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas affected in his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which they supported his stories.
The Spanish newspaper recognized that "no way" to measure and know if the books change life, "but I believe that it is a pure entertainment, an efímere experience," Vargas Llosa, who said that this "he has effects" and "does the most inconform people", so he asked the writers "do not abandon the frivolity" and "assume with responsibility" his vocation.
Climateology decreases the Pooblanco ferry that also remains without rejon
The festival of rejonns that closed the feast of Pooblanco was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the announced rejonners that the stage of the place was not located in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the course.
The horrological inclemences have been weakened with this ferry, since two of their three festivals were finally not able to celebrate.
The Sabbath was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second road of planned towers.
The cartel composed it José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to guard to a Castillblanco inch
So, just Thursday there was a party.
In him, the triumpher was Daniel Luke, who cut three ears and went out to shoes, after abandoning passengers with a pleasant and steady.
At the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante salted his two shots with health and one ear, which granted more trends than their tower.
Yes, the worst was El Julie, who passed through the body of Los Llanos without penalty or glory.
In his second tower, after a feet of alive, the bronch of a large part of the public was won.
A control in Alava is sprung in a cargo with two thousand kilos of hachis
Five less than ten of the morning.
Trade control of Ertzaintza in the municipal term of Armiñón (Alava).
Agencies give the two employees of a car and they run away.
Your load, more than two tons of hachis, wasn't like to stop.
Agencies persecuted and stopped one of the two employees, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., was informed in a communication by the Department of Interior of the Vasco Government.
The arrested person has been accused of trafficking of drugs and public documentation.
The incident was registered when several officers of the Alava Traffic Unit conducted a N-1 transport control, in their pass through the municipal term of Armiñon.
They were available to stop a vehicle for their inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, accelerated brushfully and sprouted the control.
The agents started their persecution until the vehicle stopped a few miles later in the arc, while their two employees were able to flee to the carrier through a forest area.
The Ertzaine finally reached one of them and covered from the 2.178 kilo of hachis transported and found after inspecting the car, a Iveco Daily.
The back part of the vehicle was loaded by hachis, so they were transferred to police dependences for an exhaustive and weight inspection of drugs.
Furthermore, the officers checked that the matrix was "日" because it did not match the collection in the documentation of the carrier, so it was also imposed to arrest a criminal of public documentation.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate to result in the arrest of the other suspicious, which has been able to flee to the carrier as it was said, and to determine the result of drugs.
The detainer, A. A. J. of 28 years, was sent to police dependences in order to perform the relevant diligences and will be available in the next hours.
Stop Heather Locklear acting by conducting under the effects of some medicine
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for conducting under the effects of some medicine.
A test has seen her to perform strange handiops when they go out of their parking in Montecito, a carrier of the California road patrol has been revealed in the magazine People.
The test has detailed that about the 16.30 hours, Locklear "was pissing down the accelerator, making a lot of sound, getting the car from the parking back and back, and walking back, he passed several times over his sun-shirts."
Shortly later, the test that, as the beginning, had not recognized the act, saw that Locklear stopped in a nearby car and went out of the vehicle.
This person warned the emergency services because he was "inquired of Locklear's life."
When the police patrol came, he found the actriz sitting inside his vehicle, which was partly blocking the road.
"He looked disoriented," so the agents brought her to the specialized centre of drugs and alcohol to perform a test.
It is a police carrier, the actor was shown co-operative, and the alcohol ́s ́s was rejected since the first time, although "the officers were first observed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medicine".
Locklear was arrested as a suspicious of conducting under the effects of some substance that have not been specified and entered in the local prison over 19 hours although he was in freedom for a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear went out of an Arına treatment clinic where it was recovered from an anxiety episode and depression.
Calls call for the IU's wanduza federalization to take their competence in Silva case
The general coordinator of the U.S. and Member of the United Union, Gaspar Llamazares, has assured today that it will be the regional Federation of the training that should take a decision on the case of the former conceal of Youth and Deports of the Avenue of Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who issued the last week after it was accused of conducting a favor for families.
"I am very federalist for these things, and the organization will be walking with which he must take his powers," Lamazares pointed out on the action that the party must adopt with which he has yet designed in the Sevillan Constitution.
However, the IU leader defended the need for "transparency" in the possible investigations on the irregularities that Silva could have done: "I have always defended that this type of matters have the maximum degree of transparency."
On the same line, he highlighted that training has "strict ethical codes for all public charges".
'Singre de May', the epic appeal of Garci
Inspired in the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recruits the glorious exhibition of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de May, which is the most ambitious film in his filming with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the cinema has “Iluminated the torrent of personalities and social analysis” that has always wondered in the work of the newslist known, he has explained today during the presentation of the cup, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevary before a large list of interpreters.
Singer of May, with a metrage above the two and a half hours, is stretched this Friday in the cinematographic rooms, to become a ministry for Telemadrid more than four hours of duration.
Great amazing of the Galdós' ́a, José Luis Garci assured that he had fulfilled this round "a finance dream", which must thank the Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community has been charged three years ago to round a memorative circle for the second centurion of May 2th, something that he accepted always and when the report was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets which have been brought throughout it by the Madrid Community constitute for Garci a single opportunity to enhance the decorates and the appropriate clothing of "an atomed Spain who was wronged by the leader to fight, since the fight for independence led to a huge delay to the people with Fernando VII rulership," he pointed out.
But the cinemaist has not counted with a financing such as the Alatriste or the Goya fantasmas - more than the double of the Sangre de May - so it has not been able to rotate some placed scenes in a script signed at Horacio Valcarcel, with whom he has cooperated in almost all his career.
That is why the director of Rever to begin, has ́d in which it is his habitual form of work, the scene with the actors, with whom he seems to test before the roading and those who do not casting, looking "humilant" and considering that "part of the office of the director resides in reaching the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry where he works".
Many of the interpreters who match in Sangre de May repeat before their camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar in four times - of which he won one -, Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Ajumamia of Hollywood, the own Sangree of May, Seven French billet tables and finally selected, the blind girasoles, are not representing a young generation of the Spanish cinema, "that is the one to be known," he assured.
With this film, Garci doesn't expect premises.
"In the beginnings you think you work for the seed, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and now you agree with another film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional traictory.
Isabel Bayón returns the essence of Sevillana Dancing Tortola Valencia
A sevillain dance will also make a sevillan baller.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of the Catalanic father (Florenz Tortola Ferrer) and the mother and Andaluza (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana bar, and when she was three years old, he moved to London with her family.
It was a free and specialist dance baller in east dance.
He had a tremendous life, a pleasure from the freedom of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated by the abolition of the corse that prevented the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who marked a dancistic and estate revolution in Europe of wars, fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa'oa and she proposed me this person and looked incredible."
If the dance is, "We are not intending to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of your dances have suggested me the flamenco's pairs.
So "the dance of the maripose" suggested me a guai, or "the dance of the serpent" some tanks.
His dance was without, and to me they told me that my dance is also inside this esthic."
The mount accounts with two initiatives: the Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabel in one of its spectacles, as he did in the "The Open Port" and with the Master Matilde Coral, who has spontaneously wanted to cooperate with who he was.
"Matilde makes Tortola greater, the personage of matureness.
I'm happy because I've accepted to act in my work and I feel very honest for it."
The mount also counts on the musical and guitarras composite of Jesus Torres and Áriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percutence of El Pajaro, as well as the violation of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Jeanfra Juárez, "which makes the role of the everlasting role of this kind of artists who were divorced in all its ambition, and who always walk in love with them."
In the work, the life of this woman was also in some way developed in such remote places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as he normally lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it's of those women who have a huge influence in a certain time and now no one knows and is much less valuable to their work," Property Bayon.
The spectacle will start today at 20,30 hours in the Vega Lope theatre.
The publication of the "Recently Married Daily" also closes the Trinity
The presentation of the first and illustrated "A Reconciliated Poeta Journal" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is included within the activities scheduled by the Culture Counsel of the Council of the Andalucies to celebrate the "Trinio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the purpose of memoring the fifty-year-old anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Price of Literaturation and the failure of both.
In this way, the "Trinio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to its end with the ree日 of this work, with the International Congress celebrated in New York, with the restoration of the Museum House of Nobel and with the exposure itself "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The light shot" that was injured last month of May and that, after traveling through the various andaluous provinces, it will be predicted to New York during the transition of the International Congress.
Moreover, the Culture Council of the Counsel of Andalucia has gained a total of 800 exemplars of the "Daily of A Recencased Poeta", published by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the diffusion of the figure and work of one of the most universal poets.
America is less like without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is of the Sally Field actriz, who worked with him in the "Aussance of Malicia", and gives the idea of the American cinema department, and of all America, before the impacting idea that Newman has gone.
Look that they costed to give him a Oscar.
And that was departed since 2007.
And that I knew I was very lucky.
Still that's been a crazy for everyone.
"Now I have lost a big friend," Robert Redford wept, "My life and my country were better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid to make the ridiculous or exagerate.
A father of the cine and the patriarch had died in a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with the American self-estimation for the grounds, seeking unexpected reasons for dignity.
When it's so hard time and without men and very little you're to be amazing you, it doesn't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He was incarnating for everyone an ideal of almost platonic beauty and reality.
He was official host of Richard Nixon and defensor of lost and winned causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn by overdose to his case and organic food mark.
Every gift to a country who has costed much to overcome a selfish food culture.
The expansive wall of Hollywood Barry admiration without attaching nationalities or passengers.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Wireless, found that he didn't die a man but an ear.
Other English, the Oscarized Director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was not less than the summary of his career.
The bad boy arrived from 日a, Crowe, was attracted to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us the list very high to everyone," George Clooney observed, perhaps one of the little ones who today are attracted to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high probability requirement and having a serious and remote life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in the media jungle today.
But there's someone, and Paul Newman is his example.
He was divorced once but then he was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when they certainly had the opportunities to not be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have a filet inside?", he was just bromeling himself.
In heaven, you have seen him the proud that their daughters in the earth match their fans, something not so common in America.
"From all the great papers he interpreted, no one was so proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the loving grandfather and the dedicated philantrop," they say.
The imperfect carryer of a olympical Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that they are celebrated in Madrid some olimpiated and, after 2012 failure, may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of the career yesterday, I say no!
The perfect career called her, and my judgment was the worst career with much of which I was.
A collection of disproportions that, since then, if they had considered it as an evaluation and I would consider, would be a very clear suspension.
But we're going through parts and from the beginning.
The disproposite begins with the collection of the wallet, which makes you need to go before.
What doesn't seem bad to me, but if they're already making you go to give it all (the chip to avoid colds in the carrer).
You can't.
Here they just made you go to collect the darshal (primely unproposite, go only to it) and (after the relevant school), surprise!, there was only a screen 'S' for the cart (second unforgettable, because I need a XL wallet)
In what world do we live?
Or have they decided to buy only small screens with less screens and more screens?
Well, things like these are a minucy compared to the day of the career.
Besides having to go very quickly to collect the chip, the school at the arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the mochila.
More than 35 minutes was waiting, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was to wait, even the career and we haven't yet left the mochila, although once it was achieved, the collection was worse.
Furthermore, the rain amine’s waiting for more than 40 minutes, which joined with popular rebellion and thrown to the box.
I think about 500 people will certainly have pulmony tomorrow, and some like me, and if it does not appear with the right time in the classification, because of the chip that they gave me that I imagine it didn't mark my output correctly.
Since then, if you ask me about the perfect career, this wouldn't come into my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream with a well prepared olympical city.
Microsoft Search Recipient (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft Emergentes Technology Conference has shown a progress of a new system of recognition of images and interactions, a species of Artificial Intelligence without much intellectuality but is able to perform some basic tasks, such as requesting a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move through the campus of the company) with regard to what he hears in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they have - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
The grouping of the presents is also the discussion groups.
In the video showing the recipient detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that it is not a employer of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and he says he's gonna take care of him soon.
Everything without screenshot.
Impressionant.
But that's, of course, the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, in the next version of your operational system, Windows.
This week has been spoken very much over a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many programs associated.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers come with the improvable instead of charges of commercial basury, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
Any finding notes that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "exter" to Windows.
The change of rubbishment is thankful.
Microsfot has the right, the operational system will lose importance, and also software.
When Google Chrome went out to the network, I was one of those who were summarized to the theory that it was the first step of Google to competite with Windows.
Many have clearly indicated that a browser is not a operating system.
The operational system will always be needed because it is the improving layer to understand Hardware and Software.
Complete the same function as your wife or her husband when you have to tell her sister something.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but we must think of the "death" of the operational system not as a absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People always give less attention to the operational system, and more to the web browser.
The computer is running only to run the Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we're browsering more time than in the window environment.
For what are the half of the applications coming on the system?
At least it's more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than View.
Less weak, less reloaded, less complete.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating your online services and they are finally an alternative to Google.
They need it unexpectedly, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo of this post I took it in one of the rest rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of months.
In the refrigerator, a cartle asks you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the network.
Last week, of course, a break was also confirmed in the new Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come to the beginning of 2009 but to the end, rather than to 2010.
In Microsoft, they will certainly search for the Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will pass the facture.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso was taking her at the Costa A日, Caprio luminated one in Edward Zwick's blood Diamant, the same as Alıino in 'El Padrino' of Francis Ford Coppola and became part of the uniform of the gay muscled paroquia.
And if we set up star apparitions, we can get back to the image of that pointigud bigote force that was weakened in a ambulant circle.
In the meantime, it's not more than the typical inner masculine masculine in the cockpit, white and without hands.
The 'tank', which calls the English speaking, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Brussels describes all the other.
First, by its rebombing name - even though familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which you have to see with the sport because you receive your name, it is accounted for the leyenda, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the loving song Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' highlights the other by its excellent cow, by its unisex court, by its distinctive escudo and by the small Belgian flag (only recognisable) that most embryo-master models are brought as detail in the wheel.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian signature is not only focused on its tops.
It also includes sudare college, back boxers, cashmer cardidants, cocktails, marine trucks, babies, mini shorts...
Take thoughts for underwear beauty.
Although it's a pen to leave them as an internal clothes.
They have too much pleasure.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't care for me."
His enormous similar to her sister did not prevent you from developing her own personality.
Monicaz is often but full of vitality.
Now the sisters are very seriously taking their new activities in mode.
For Monica, they're much more than some beautiful and famous girls who give their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion of the signature of Mango in its new seat, as well as the presentation of the most important premiums of moda than the Spanish house spensorizes.
Calm and hot, win in short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we have imagined my sister Penelope and I to Mango at this new winter-session, as well as attending the presentation of the second and § of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but at the same time, exciting.
On what is your new collection based for Mango at this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I love the movie of the 50s and 60s; we have taken many references.
Then I like a town and watch women as they are clothing, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do much.
Bailarin, actriz and design, you're a very polyfactic woman, right?
I think so, but at the end, it's all one, and they have a lot of legs in common.
I liked my clothes from a little bit; I wanted to go home from my grandmother to shoot in the arms of my grandmother and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than to go to the park of attractions.
Then, from dancing, I always tried to care about how I was worried.
You know that the dancers like us to make our stylisms for classes and tests, to look at us at the speech and feel well.
And in the role of acting when they give you the clothes is when you really find the person.
So, everything will be united, yes, with much respect to designers and professionals.
You've completed no longer 30 years ago. Did you get a crisis?
What's going on.
I feel better than never, I like 30.
I find that the woman's done, has experience and saborate life with less errors.
To me, the biological clock doesn't make me.
I did the things I wanted from little, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking to be a mother or not?
Since then, I know I'm going to be a mother because the body asks me and, too, I want to be a young mother; this is not me.
I don't care about the candidate.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with much love.
As regards the movie, you're a lot of strangers that you've surrounded last year.
That's it, and I'm glad they're looking at the light.
I, that I am a woman coming from the theater, I'm very impressionant and anxious, I want it all for now and clearly, can't be.
I'm glad they're trained 'The last hour' and 'Search for Christ' tub.
Seeing they look like...
A few days ago you debuted on a passenger with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I'm going up to a passenger to make a model.
It simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I've already known for a while, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial defil for his organization 'Young men for a better world' and the clothes we showed - I took two parts of our collection to Mango - he was up to recover money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that heart of Naomi.
So many things about her are saying that, I and I know her, I would tell you that many are not sure.
Moreover, I stay with that kind of part in which she is involved.
He asked me to break out for a so noble cause, but if I'm coming to ask me that I should do the pine, for it's also.
For the benefits of women in the third world, what is needed.
Reciprocal alcoholic drivers must install the 'alcolock'
Internal desires that the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholism should install in his vehicle a system that prevents the drunk vehicle, or if it is not surfaced.
The initiative has already been announced last June and now is already included in the annual memory of the State General Fisheries, which is a pilot project which will have a period of a year.
Its end is the reintegration of the driver, so this will also receive a vial re-education course.
In the experience, as well as the Vial Safety General Office, they will participate in the Director-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institution for Car Safety (FITSA).
Statistics are described, between 30% and 75% of the cars declared more than once by driveing drinks are again to take the car.
Alcolock would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in spiral air and prevents the car to drive if the driver doesn't surface aboves; or when a alcohol concentration is detected is higher than permitted.
Its cost is greater than 1.000 euros and would run according to the sanction.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduced crimes to 65% during the first year of implantation.
And in Spain it is calculated that it could save life to 115 people every year.
The measure is addressed to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to cope with these behaviors before they commit criminal crimes.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be made by way, and, however, the necessary reform by criminal way requires reform in a organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial way, although it has already been experimentally introduced in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Right tomorrow, the Congress of the Members will vote tomorrow a OSO initiative in which it is proposed to install this system in school buses, as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British puntuality, at 17.40, the time set out in the programme, the Hungar presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez de Mexico DF was the airport of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturia traveled.
The sun was departed, but its rayes still were forced to use the hand as a wizard to see the real couple descending from the plane.
At the stage, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours ago I had asked the road, the taxist, if I knew that the Spanish princes visited the city to formalize an official journey.
Oh, very good, then you can't go to the gate to load that hour... she's from here or so...
- No, sir, she's Spanish but she lived here for a few years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexico press well knows who are the Princes of Asturias and the importance of the travel.
Many are waiting for the hangar of the port attached to the red hole and a military valley formed by 27 marine soldiers who interpret the salvation of honors.
The Prince appears sorrowful, dressed by a marine, and she, the Princesa, melena at the wind, very sorry, doesn't use her 'peep-toes' habitual, maybe they had communicated her that in the DF threatened the torment.
They give a smile and a scratch stopped to the actors before they go to the room where the official committee is expected.
At the door of the hotel, one of the four larges of the city, expects a diaracher of the Mexico TV.
The best donated premium of mode
Perhaps there is no happening in the nearest world to present a moda premium that Paris and perhaps there is no more exquisite and good designer living than Valentino.
Mango just presented the second and § of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international projection of the new talents of mode.
It is charged with a premium of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belga winner of the first and Family, looked at its designs in Mango's escape at the number 54 of the Housesmann Bulevard of Paris and almost wept from the emotion.
In fact, it is the second largest tent of the signature in Europe, and it is just injured with 1.335 square metres of surface.
The first is in London.
So many attitudes, associated with the desire to thank the designer Valentino that he would preside the jury, have made us end at a luxe dinner in the Garnier of Paris.
With the nearest Chagals' neighborhood, the Chagal presidential table prepared by Mango was still more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart sent down and doing of heart trips, for the recent failure of his brother, was put a trail of the House and some ELAH addresses, which cut off the respiration, and the arm of his son Luis - a canon of almost two meters of length - joined Valentino in the presidential of his homemate.
Andik, owner and gentleman of Mango, did the honors and he was so gentleman that he ended, at the baron of Roøjil, without cook, because they both had been delivered to two ladies.
Monica\z, who came to the tent with bottles and trucks - of own design - and for the dinner was transformed with a long black sexy clothes, was emotional when in the night past by the oper, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet test room and she, remembering other times, reached one of the bars and made a hidden of 'grand pl'.
Inés Sastre didn't stay on the past for the palace dependences, but he taught us at the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we could enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canon that moves in a moto - and by John Tra日, who came to Paris's intercontinental hotel, with his Sabanas, his toilets and requested before, that there were no elsewhere in his room.
Stars under the stared heaven of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is no 1000 but 1000 more ways to view the caotic and frenética daily life.
And for a little, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relax to libraries on September 30.
The wakeman almost punishes when it sounds every morning at the 7th morning, but it is still worse to imagine involving in the aggressive ritme that puts the present life.
The Office is called pressure and the spring pain computer.
Stress is the bad of the XXI century.
But there are not one or two methods to fight daily disconnection and disconnection problems with the work world.
No, the number is up to, nothing more and nothing less than 100
At the margin of the yoga positions, the classic massage or the 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book all a 'menu' of opportunities adapted to the pleasure and minutes of each.
The anti-stress work is called "1001 ways to relax" and its peace will reach the libraries of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or → personal relations, this 'manual' dismiss such faith.
Furthermore, it offers other procedures such as being contacted with the nature or receipts of 100% of naturals that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenalina no longer runs through your venes to restore the body balance and the stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the sofa, get away from mind and focus on reading.
Talk sleeping
Some kids talk about tonight.
I don't mean those who are very disappointed tell us something that has happened last day, but children who speak sleeping.
The first time it happens to the best you take a suit, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a good change of dream that is called dreams.
It's very common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one have told you he talked about the night.
This phenomenon can appear very spontaneously (one time in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodic (all days, once a week, once in months...) on the next day the child does not recall anything.
There is no unique cause to determine its appearance.
They are often related to other changes of dream such as the weaknesses, the night terrors, the nocturn enuresis (doing sleep) or sonambulism, but it must not be so.
As we already mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very high fever tables, stress or overhearted.
In all ways, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very different.
It may be that he speaks in a quiet tone of voice, sound words, a murmure or all the opposite (greetings, lamps, long talks...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, the child should be observed and consulted with a specialist, to check if there is a question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him the outcome of this way.
We have said that it is a bennigna change, so it does not have any treatment, except that it will be associated with another change of dream that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with an apnea of the dream or a stress table).
What can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite much the kid before he goes to sleep.
So seek quiet games and avoid programs or series of television that are fearful or a little violent.
With very nervous children and who costs them to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them win a certain internal calm.
This will help the child to have a more quiet dream.
Once the dreams appear, keep the calm.
Remember that they are innocent for the child and that the next day you will not remember anything that happened.
Advantaged Councils
Don't wake it up.
It is unusual, for he is not conscious, and you will break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's relaxing.
Remember that if it appears very troubled during several episodes, it would be necessary to consult or discern what is that causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most usual), do not fall in trying to make you a question to smash your information.
You won't get anything, because when you are sleeping, you're not aware of how to organize your thoughts.
Besides, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what he's dreaming to say that, with which you are very careful about how you interpret the information and the conclusions that you're going out.
You never tell the kid that you can ask him about the night to know your secrets.
You don't know what you're doing.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In summary, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that takes only a few minutes.
It's gonna end!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way of the victory in its field after a long period of escase.
Without having done a good party, the team created many occasions of gol and was able to make a gol to win the game.
The time was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty to express themselves.
After a first temptation of Captain Kauffmann, who split the squadra with a distance trail, Illhaeusern cuasi was going to take the "power" and by the founderflick turn far, then with Hirn up, Romein with the point of the foot, or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we wouldn't leave the center camp and just put Riahi in the position of attack.
The second time principle was crucial, first with two occasions of gol of Riahi and Temporary for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the markup for the Ilhousiens with the gol of Marais, well-bened to collect the balon in a first tentative of Diebold (53).
But the guleator Illhousiens can't spend much time his happiness and will be forced to return to the guards for a decade of minutes later and thus leave your team partners in digital minority.
But Dannemarie will not use the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven Illuusians who returned a little back to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a significant pharmaceutical, the balon passed very close to the transversal field.
Sarkozy finds furious fishers
Before switching to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a round for British.
With regard to the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who intensely disturbed the inputs of several British and regulatory ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on Thursday to the Gate of Guilvinec in Finistère to find its representatives there.
These promised to join it " with a constructional spirit " and they hope " to come with concrete proposals."
This presidential visit coincides with the General Assembly of the " Crisis Committee " established by the British fishers to achieve measures against the increase in gasoline prices, which marks a record in achieving EUR 1,14 per litre.
It is described as Eliseo David Martinon, President " will discuss with them solutions that may be imagined to help their companies to rescue the conditions of employment and remuneration of the mariners. "
Fishers wait for Nicolas Sarkozy firmly.
On Tuesday morning, they took operations to aminorate the employment in Morbihan and the Calvados, which have caused such attacks of almost 10 km.
The Kiberon sports gate has also been locked, but connections to Belle Island have not been stopped.
" A filtering barrier " has been placed on the Kiberon Peninsula.
The mariners have already shown their determination on Monday, burning, raying the white, neumatical and wood palettes before the brest gates deposits, and Lorient, while manifestations had occurred in Concarneau or Saint-Brie.
The movement was spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and Mancha, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the boats remained at the gate, or in Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the movements of the trading vessels.
The fishers of La Turballe and Crossic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, stopped the blocking of the important refinary total of Donges.
Boulogne-sur-Mer fishers decided to wait until the midnight which will take place to the Ministry to think about any action.
In Guilvinec, the " Crisis Committee " will have to think on Tuesday in the development of movement and its participation in the meeting provided in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishers do not want to be representatives of the national fishing committee, which did not submit their movement.
" The hole will pro" because " the fishers did not leave " and " wouldn't move to Paris, for example, Liliane Cariou, the President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishers, who do not pay gasoline rates, are currently paying about 50 centimeters per litre but believe that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a gasolie with a price less than EUR 0,30 per litre.

Obama, winner during the first television pain
At the first debat of Friday between both candidates in the White House, another occurred to know who triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the General Chambers of Republic and Democratic Campaigns announced their own victory in this television fate followed by a third of the American familys.
The political analysis David Gergen considers that John McCain's performance, although honourable, was not "best "brillant" to allow him to break his low in the sonds at five weeks of the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose review of the public opinion published last Sabbath, grants five benefit points for Obama (49 % against 44 % for McCain), considers that it is the democrate who went out well.
Among the individual electors, which are those who are accounting, Obama was winner with 39% of the questionnaires, while 25% of them granted the victory to McCain, it is a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm its benefit on Thursday with the good expected delivery of its member of his own candidature, José Biden, during the first and unique public debate with her rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to subestimate it.
He has good instincts, "before Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventh anniversary McCain showed its unusual experience in external policies, underlineing the "inhumanity" of his opposer on these issues that were in the heart of this first chaos.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama had the experience and knowledge necessary to be president, " he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in republican television publications.
Obama subrayed that he represented the future.
Without disappointment, it was shown concise and precise.
Real is its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the picture of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done it, " replied, this weekend, a democratic television publicity that reproached the Republic because he had not considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on the and the things."
"The nineteen minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama announced yesterday, before 20,000 people who had been gathered for a electoral in North Carolina under a new rain.
He did not speak the words "middle class" or "workers". "Financial damage is clearly favored by Obama, which is considered by the e's as the most able to save the economy that is at the border of the precipicium.
"The next week could be a decisive episode," he loved, yesterday, the influent and democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an ancient member of the Clinton administration, compared the " good economic instincts " of Obama with Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
The democratic candidate, current financial disaster " is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
Reaffirming that, despite Wall Street's surplus, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the implementation of any energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear centrals from here to 2030.
In fact, both candidates were deployed of the issues referring to the financial salvation plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely improved.
"In Minsk, have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Youths and or Others showed the Sunday last afternoon at the main place of the Belarus capital to pre-cipient the results of the legislation.
Some hundreds of Belaruses were gathered on Sunday afternoon from the closure of electoral centres in the Central Place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of legislation.
While no results were yet announced, many young people had come to demonstrate the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: " The dictator must be released."
Some recognize that they have not voted: "for what, because they will do what they want with my vote, " says a young man.
They do not believe that the scheme that has made the foreign observators good to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 Belarus leaders and the congelation of certain assets, could be raised if these elections are considered as observators.
It wasn't the opposite.
"We have been placed by electoral commissions, and our observers could not participate in the vote summary," Jouri Potemkine, the portfolio of the Union of Democracy Forces, was denied by a heetogenic re-up of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change, subrayed by Alexandre Milinkievitch, the former candidate of opposition to the presidential election of 2006 and the leader of the movement pro European, because the importance of the votes, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some of the opposition members come into Parliament, it is because they will be appointed but not selected.
" But its entrance to Parliament may mean apparitions in television, meetings in regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our economy, which has many debts from Russia, comes into crisis, and if we don't reform, we are in danger of being a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe followed by the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
It highlights that the participation numbers appear to be too high, and that the generalisation of the vote with anticipation (26 % of the electors in Minsk) promoted manipulation.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask the social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the electoral centres.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposite to the Parliament, those who agree better with the power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the October place.
In television, President Loukachenko and members of the Electoral Central Committee are welcomed for their success.
Interview - Singre is back to be safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated his 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Francine Decary, had the reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has returned to be one of the most safe and effective blood suppliers in the world.
In particular, he recovered the confidence of the public that was seriously empty by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, national blood reservations administrated by the blood transfusion Service of Canadian Red Red Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunity Virus (VIH) and hepatitis C virus during 1980.
With regard to this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada made in February 1994 a public investigation, presided by judge Horacio Krever, which intended to explain the circumstances that had led to such tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such disasters would not be played anymore.
While Judge Krever was late in presenting his relationship, some provincies then created a committee that was aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee completed this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to overcome all other provincies and both territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Quebec eats its activities, nearly 38 per cent of people still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, Decary reports.
The situation was dealing.
After a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years followed, we have recovered public confidence, " before we are fiercely encouraging that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population had the next trust in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Decary recalls, however, that " confidence is something extremely fragil."
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec applied the principle of precaution.
At that time, we attended Europe to the birth of many cases of the human variant of the illness of the crack, a new variety of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, accounting Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of the Reports of Krever and Gélineau, which when we don't know and when a serious disease can evacuate it, in this case the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that leads inevite to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we rejected the blood of people who have remained more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
But a few years ago, it has been demonstrated out of all doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the principle of precaution that was applied had the meaning. "
In 1999 there appeared a much more sensitive HIV detection technique in the market: nuclear acid tests that allow to identify the presence of the virus and not the anticorps against virus, which based on tests used until now.
Nuclear acid tests have allowed to shorten the period between the time when the person has been infected and the time when the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We could reduce this period in a less than one week.
We so substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements have been allowed to consider the risk of covering the AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, every 12 million people are risked to receive blood contaminated by HIV.
"It means that you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected by HIV.
As Hema-Quebec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products each year, it will be over 24 years before a HIV transmission case occurs by a blood product.
I think you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion today to recover health without concern," the head of the Hema-Quebec direction.
" Our challenge for the next deity is to maintain the security of our products.
You never know what patogen could occur in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Conference that, for example, of the Western Nilo virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It must be constantly watchful ", follow Dr. Decary before submitting that, in addition to a safe accommodation, Hema-Quebec must also provide a sufficient accommodation.
" Needs increase because the population is old.
Since most aggressive anticancerogen treatments, patients often need a injection of red or placebo.
The age of the population has also effects on the network of blood donors that reacts in the mean term only 3% of Quebecs acceptable to blood donation. "
However, everyone with good health, 18 years old and corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, can give blood every 56 days, or six times per year.
In the meantime, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from aid or malaria, for example, and if they travel into a country where Malaria reignes, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3 per cent, we will be able to maintain a inventar that covers hospital needs.
The pains are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors must be renewed as they are old and cannot give their blood anymore.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to be regular donor.
Since the current life is very defeated, we rarely find the time to pass a hour to give your blood, "the Francine Decary is disappointed.
With a budget of 297 million dollars annually, Hema-Quebec is not only blood products but also human tissues, including oceans, cardiac valves, eye globules and skin that are almost used for large burned.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public blood hold of the umbilical coron in Quebec.
The umbilical cordon that anciently was considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of mother cells that can be used for treatment of serious diseases such as leucemia.
"We have celebrated a few weeks ago, putting in our thousands of blood shows of the umbilical coron and expecting to take over thousands of these per year.
We should begin to propose it for injections at the beginning of the next year ", needs Dr. Decary that describes this program of curoning blood as very popular.
" Many moms are deceived of not to be able to enjoy this, 'although Hema-Quebec has no resources to propose this complete and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softbol - The Effect on Semifinals

Shortly – Kovalev's winner gol
The third number one of Canadians is ready to take the season.
The composition unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a winning by 3-2 of Canadian to the bar bar bar bars before the Panthers of Florida, yesterday in the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marched a goal, Plekanec collected two supports, and Kovalev collected a step in this winning, the quarter of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only gol.
"I'm not still ready, I'm before the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play at the first time, noted Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had an ovation. "
Charest is occupied by the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude to carry out elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general advice of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc (from the left), would be chosen during the partial election of today.
Reject the limits of our last large north border: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force remains in the large lines, at the end of the general consequence of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
After him, during his speech, images were projected.
They scrolled, in three large screens, spectacular images of emballages, mineral explosion, from Quebec viewed by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media such as during the electoral period.
The Prime Minister thinks that elections will take place this hour, although he has seen that his time is very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a "visition" which the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, the " new economic space " which includes an agreement on the hand of work with France, a covenant between Canada and Europe and the harmonisation with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the talks of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the north territory at the 49th parallel - had never been subject to a presentation.
The Prime Minister had not yet been limited to explain why the North was " a joy to the great potential " but did not give a term, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
What could be most developed is: especially the election, the forest, but, in particular, the mining sector, the growth of emergency countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains " niquel, us, cover, platin, gold, silver, iron, titanio, and also diamant ", is the enumeration of Mr. Charest.
This " territory twice large as France " is our house, is in Quebec.
It's not only our home, but it's in us ", insisted, as to show that he requested a national funding mito.
Quebec was built much thanks to his relationship with the North, subrayed: the ride towards the gold in Abitibi, the Quebec Engineering, the Bahía James.
"We belong, it's our future," added, after having made a theatric pause to look at the large map behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec always revendicated, needed the Prime Minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments repeated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed since a long time and, when the occasion is presented, I repeat that position from the Government. "
Moreover, " with climate changes, we have to reflect on our vision of the North, " it stated by speaking about the northwest passage, which will be opened every year because of the ice flight.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupation of the territory is a debt.
What about the residents of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful for them and that the project would benefit them, especially for young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ancient member of the Quebeque Party in Hungava), have already started consultations about a trend of communities.
A interministerial committee presided by Benoit Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transportes and Natural Resources) has a significant role in some jobs.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summary " but a " in which " will be given a common vision ".
The development of the North would be made in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, ordered and respected for the environment, " he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visibility" as one who is continually with the first liberal ministers who predicted him.
" Like the Liberals who predicted us, we have thought of another way to transform the challenges in new times of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurrent issues of the end of the week, which begins on Thursday with a great cocktail to subray the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the power of the game.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rebuild the Central Beauharnois in Adelard-Godbout Embalse.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage, who made the quiet revolution and nationalization of the electionity, in Bourassa, which made the Bahía James our party was able to forget the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invited another reference, that container, the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, the first minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper emballage project, Mr. Charest highlighted that it was planned for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I intend to be there," he trusted his soldiers, raised applauses.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would not be elections in 2008 and, of course, not in 2009, refused the possibility of putting a vote in place, what the law allows him.
It subscribes that its timer is still full, especially because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York Country.
The general end-week advice made the Liberal Chairman a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec claims, in particular, to recognize the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to name members of the Radio Diffusion and Canadian Telecommunications Council and that they have a veto right on decisions taken in Quebec.
From the side of the opposite, we accept the large lines of the North Plan with escepticism.
The Chef of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North Quebec Development Policy that the Government Landry had launched in 2001.
The Liberal Government, coming to the power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If I had done it, "We would have made progress today", Mrs. Marois recommended the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (the vote has been made today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Government Plan.
"But what you want is that this is not just a spectacle," recommended leader Sebastien Proulx, in the substitution of Mario Dumont, who returns from vacations today.
Letters - A Deshonored Land
It's Mr. Vic Toews, the former minister of the "Justicia" in Harper's office, which was allowed to say that Luisa Arbour was a "see" for Canada.
Deshonoring this woman that led an incidence fight for justice and deserves all our admiration what he says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only government, among all western countries involved, who has not repatriated his national that is closed in the concentration field of Guantánamo.
It's a government that doesn't take into account any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that were re-reserved to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its promise and allows a child-solded to live in unhuman conditions.
The only one who strikes with a justice is to evaluate the responsibility of the accused.
We remember that the UNICEF, the International Amnisty and the Association of Canadian lawyers, particularly, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of a balanced process in Canada.
It's this government who closes the eyes of torture: it's little too important that a young adult be psychologically destroyed, without doubt forever after so many years of exaction.
We have not yet realized that, but we have now attended an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that he does not have any sense.
It has already come to the time there is no more moral: we can maltrace, torture, arbitrary prison for a Canadian citizen as the Governing Boss wants until now Minor (what will happen after 14 October?).
Many electors believe that they will find the salvation in a party in which the Virtud, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government rejected the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews's view is caused by this distortion and nothing else.
Free Opinion - The orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In its e - of September 17, Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, President and director of Canadian Minor Barrick Gold.
Following a orwellian logic, Barrick Gold · that the largest aircraft company in the world tried to make a six-million euro difamation process against three authors and a small editorial house in order to cause a " transparent public debate ".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecutions by divorce, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, if Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to threaten who is attracted to support a position contrary to his?
The result of the pleasure has little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada must cost significant amounts in order to prepare their defence and fight, with very desigual weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the battles almost without the miner.
Tactic, in these desigual fights, is often to destroy the requested ones in order to introduce a friendly arrangement that will be warned by the opposite, as well as to fear who will be attracted to reexamining the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public opinion that he had to present his vision of facts.
In contrast with what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are normally done for the change of ideas and not for the shipping of holes.
It was therefore enough to open its books, its issuers and establish a real debate to the journals, the media, publications and the financing of independent search equipment that would have been able to explain the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust in the public opinion and ́s requests and support letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver probably explain how he can ask for a "public debate" from the opinions of this?
The President is, it seems that this word is only designed to the very payable lawyers and not to all Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, it's that the public that supports the authors and the editors of Northern Canada makes it primarily because it's the brutal way of miner.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge it, but having a base of civilized changes of arguments, not in the context of what many people feel like a persecution-mortality (forwarding the " public debat ", Barrick Gold has just made a requirement for the authors of Noir Canada that they do not use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal talk, Barrick Gold's process is a direct attack on university and truth freedom, essential by all democratic societys.
Reject the right to quote credible sources and to discuss the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects that disappreciate the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under many persecutions, who can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wants a public and transparent debate, he could do it by following the Scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has a right to answer.
The university world, to which we belong, has already been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The dismissed persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, it does not like to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to set devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democratic and Republican are agreed
The Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, at the time of the Republic and Democratic, finally reached an agreement on the most important economic salvation plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion dollars, which intends to deal with the financial crisis that has exposed Wall Street for months ago, has to be confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, a better control by the elections of their implementation, new mechanisms intending to ensure the refund of invested public money, the new provisions to contain the number of injured houses the lack of payment, as well as the right to control on payments paid to the leaders of the supported companies.
The American Secretary of the Tesoro, Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of the Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican Representative in the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a negotiation marathon that was last two days.
"We have great progress in view of an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"All has been done to put the economy and the economics before the current crisis in Wall Street ", explained the democratic.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the traumatism, the chaos and the disturbances on the daily life of the people will be great," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been completed very quickly in the last hours because they were afraid of the effect that would cause a new failure in the humor of investors.
The last hour they had been fixed was the opening of markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which have been reached later to negotiations, have been more favourable for the agreement, however, without expressing their disapproval of being committed to this extremity.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has granted him certain provisions to reach the agreement, especially that would allow owners to maintain their home and the salary of the leaders of the survival companies by the State.
" When contributors are requested to take exceptional measures due to the irresponsibility of some, it is not necessary to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary, "recommended in the American TV.
His Republican opposer, John McCain, asked in another string to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, answered: " I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote."
" The important points I read [to show] that it is something that we will have to say and with which we will be able to progress.
He said the option to do nothing is not acceptable. "
The plan of 700 billion intends to buy with the money of the contributors' dual duties, risk and inventory activity of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the extent of an immobilious bubble that led first to the deterioration of the risk risk credits before extending to other common forms of credit licences (PCAAA) and providing a liquidity congelation and a delay of financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican elections who had made a change in the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have come out of this deal since the democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of the company in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of cleaning the aspersions for the whole world at the Congress, we also added a provision that if the Government had to take losses for five years with this programme, it could impose new taxes that would want to help him recover money.
The new plan provides the payment of a first part of 250 billion, which can be added to 100 billion other billion if it seems necessary to the President.
The payment of other 350 million would have to be confirmed by another vote by the Congress.
Instead of your aid, Washington will receive shares in supported companies that will divide you in the case of profits and that you will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of repealing the embarrassment procedures relating to residences obtained with immobiliary loans is this plan, as well as fixing limits on the remuneration and on metal compensations paid to the leaders of the undertakings affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him submitted to the vote of the Representative Chamber since today and the next Thursday of the Senate.
Despite all its efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest to this project yesterday, both from the Republican and the Democrats.
The Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Camera Finance Committee, declared to his electors that "with any evidence, Washington doesn't want to understand."
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not that consists of getting benefits from the contributors. "
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is an encourager of a small group at the Congress, presents the problems in other ways, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred economy teachers, among whom three Nobel Prices, wrote us to say: we ask the Congress not to be disappointed and consider carefully the way to take, " he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had the evidence of the world's nature of the crisis again.
After an urgent responsibility, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis Group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments in Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French BNP Paribas would know that he refused to buy his competition in silver since he lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of the immobiliar risk loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the 20 largest European and ten largest insurers.
"This is not a lost money," said the Netherlands Ministry of Finances, Wo日 Bos, yesterday.
On the contrary, we recover a voting right in the influence and influence.
It's just something that ahorrors and families will now do when the times are uncertain."
This time, on the other hand of Mancha, the British Government seemed to want to nationalize another person that suffers the financial crisis.
In the English press, the Government would be charged by all loans in Bradford and Bringley and over 41 billion euros (75.5 billion dollars) of immobiliary loans.
Spanish Santander reported yesterday that it would buy the offices and the British accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second, after Northern Rock, which the British Government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His eyes to the eyes represented their triumph for a long time.
Did the American actor with a pleasant smile have been released from his narcissian side?
Yes and not.
His power, its sensitivity and a talent that was obviously will also have removed from the record of power that have the true sacred monsters.
But what a big backward!
Paul Newman, dead on Friday, 83 years, because of a pulmonary cancer in his rand of Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the fashion years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who looked very much and was considered for a long time as a rival in the cine, more fragil in his game, certainly more fragil, but also the apostle of freedom and spread of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make magnet children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a Jewish father and a Hungarian origin mother.
From these European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
Without self-demeasured, last quality mark.
Because in him all a loved country of the own fat hand, the fighter of the war of the city, wounded in fighting, who at the beginning of the 50s studied the dramatic art in Yale, then the Actor's actor of New York frequency, before trionning in the theater, in television and soon in the cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car pilot classified in second position in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although member of a model couple formed since 1958 with Joanne Woodward act.
The secret sides of this secret, discrete and compromised star also disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the world of the spectacle that we do not know very well.
He's a honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused cinefils the vertigo this weekend, while their large papers are entered in the black screen of memories.
More than a half centuries of the seventh American art in perpetual changes to it.
Many memories returned to memory like the cowboy with appreciation of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who agits his wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the zinc tissue adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More closer to us (1990), we evoke your sensible Mr Bri ́, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfil all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have passed the film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, murdered, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hate), of Robert Wise, a role designed to James Dean, repeated after his death, which really lan’t Newman in 1956.
This famous mangant in the south film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar at the best movie in 1973.
The Hutler of Robert Rossen (1961) will repeat the personality in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which was valuable in 1987 to his only Oscar between nine nominations.
This face that changes the years was he.
He's still.
The times change during their career.
Young people know him especially thanks to George Roy Hill Slap (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, trainer of a hokey team on a little orthodox ice.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a latest role of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was risen.
In contrast to several film legends who left the carryer quite soon, Newman remained much in the world of the cine, denunciating Hollywood, his ears, his feet and his concessions.
The French cinemaist Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " the underplaying " and judges its benefits too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to which the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he often interpreted the role of young galan than marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, cabrons or desperate, whose rabbis reflected the rebellion.
As performer, Newman revealed its real popular sensitivity.
His movie Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (is the newspaper of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, described a female melancolian retraite.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose gave him his Harry and Son film in 1984, the work of power and trial.
"Am part of the numerous homenages that were deceived yesterday to Newman, his big friend and ancient weapons partner Robert Redford (he had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) I was very tristled: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important races of the fallen actor.
On the other hand, a large military is hidden for civil rights, Propertyology, independent cinema, a responsible against Hollywood's ́s.
We have seen a lot of his face rule over the vinagrete salsa boats, of the salss, of the galletes and of other foods, judgeing this method as a bad pleasant method, even though empeʹ as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to its Fund for Finance in difficulty.
Newman, rather than satisfying his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "every even the end, your father was incrediblely grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so fucking and so generous.
It's a model citizen.
What were they produced in the Zuschlag factory factory & amp; Co.?
Soon, on 8 October, the criminal process will be launched against Janos Zuschlag and its complies.
It is accused of political and its complaints to commit significant damage frauds, in business manner, continually and in other forms, including documentation.
For the purposes of the Office, the funds obtained in the public concurrence were used by the Office in many times, justifiing the fulfillment of tasks with factures.
The public funds and the approximately approximately 65 million HUF - were in part in the treasure of the Baloldal Fiatal Organization and in part in the bottle of individuals.
The method, which was also given to be known by researchers, was to justificate the cover of the funds obtained in public concurrences with factures behind which there was no real implementation, the different associations never fulfilled their commitments.
The accusation is made, most of the factures were fair.
To this end, the taxoners received the market in the district of Josephfuros and the seals were produced in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that, on behalf of which company, the fabric should be carried out, it was decided between others in that tour by the Superior Balaton Region where Janos Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
This last admitted that for this purpose, I should choose hostals and restaurants.
He requested a fax for its consumption, and these served as a model to construct the facts presented among others in the concurrences of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, in the Ministry of Social and Working Affairs, as well as in the Capital Assembly.
These factures were signed in their majority by István Sidos and their company András 日ri, who our information was better written the reports necessary to obtain public subventions.
One of his "Studial Travels" pages chose a beer.
Two factors issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its complices, this gastronomical centre provided food for a group of ninety people of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesuelet.
However, the center manager is - many people do not end at the same time.
Similarly, the facture issued in 2002 for the Jobb Jövért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Evezredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
After one host of the city of Badacsonytomaj, there were only three rooms and more than ten people could not be able to stumble in one night, but in the fax was hundred and thirty people.
But great fantasy factors also exaggerated when signed to the Gastronomical Centre Pigal Kft. because in the books tender of itself - the information given to the Fiscalia - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövért and Hoppá.
Gy ·z · Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the fiscal and showed the factures, he knew that it was a document.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He said: In addition to the formal problems, he did not agree that the facture was extended to hundreds of people, because they have only 11 rooms where there are not so many people.
Furthermore, foods were also included in the fax, while the restaurant has not worked ago.
The enthusiastic factory manufacturers were also not informed that the agency chosen to travel outside in Budapest organized travels, so in the actual payment factory, they indicated tonely as a service for a travel within Hungary, which also coincided with the performance practice of the agency.
Furthermore, as it was assumed during the investigation, IVA also included in the document, despite the travel outside the European Union's territory was excluded from taxes.
Among other things, the measurement of the IVA was also wrong in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfülöp Kft. for the foundation Jobb Jöv©ért, since the services of that company were not loaded with a 25 but only with 15% of IVA, and the employees of the hotel were only extended to machines, however, the facture was manually.
Furthermore, the "expeditors" made other errors, as in the case of a company in which they placed the road transport activities to which, during fiscal investigations, was not conducted by the company based as investment advisor.
Similarly, by formal differences - inadequate format of the facture, I know that the factures issued for Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány, for XXI. Šázadi Egyesület Culturalis and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camping of Kunfeherto, whose representatives refused to have sent these facts.
The eligibilities also noticed that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group comía (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation process, so the responsibility of the liquidation process - was our information - was refused to have issued that document.
The factures were consciously exposed
Another group of factory manufacturers is constituted by those who were conscious of that they should issue ficticial factors.
The Esély Budapestert Alapitvány Fundation, on request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued a fax of approximately four million HUF on behalf of the Egypt Fundation to Harmadik Evezredert.
The Collab Kft manager. - is the accusation - one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, convinced him to issue ficticial factures.
The Biogate Kft, currently under the liquidation process, was also working with Zuschlag and its complies, which gave factures in 2003 by a value of about five million HUF to the foundation Jobb Jövért Alapitvány , to the Atlasz Egyesület and to the Forösfeny Partnership , without real economic activity behind.
There was also no movement of capitals, since then they cancelled the prepared factures but were invited to make their documents known to this.
The following group of factory manufacturers includes those who have some link to accused.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the applicant of the Ucrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with ficticity seat in Budapest, which was occupied with the fuel trade and vehicles.
This company exposed numerous factures by an estimated value of 18 million HUF in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of information media.
The data of the research were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also split the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognised during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company facture for the Atlantic, the Hoppa and Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány, covering the amount itself.
Fa-Bani Jos Facpari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Roman albanes at the request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively because - the accused - that they did not receive work.
But it benefited from these companies, since, on request of his companion, lawyer Zsolt Sente, who prepared the registration documents of the company, sent facts on behalf of the companies to the organizations associated with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and the Y-generation.
Kubatov in the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave 15 different factors for a value of 14,2 million HUF.
The Office considered Kubatov received the IVA and 10% of the amount of the taxes.
This man even used the Szi-Beri committee company to deliver ficticial factures used in the Biztos Pont concurrence.
The Y-generation and Šövetség in Modern Magyarorzhágért presented a concurrence in January 2006 to Tahájsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA), of public use of the Socialist Party.
They received 500 thousand HUF respectively, but they did not use the money for the purposes of the concurrence.
To avoid discovering this, five fitting factors received from the Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These were the factures found during the record of the packaging that Arrd Kemecsei had at the Department of Education.
Part of the accused ones will probably report in the judgment - as they did in the Fiscalia - the course of factures.
The most interesting may be the confession of the principal accused Janos Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
After its confessions until now have not been very detailed and although he has recently promised to speak of everything, this has not done until present.
The question is: What is it interested in doing so? Because, in turn, in turn of the majority of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached a agreement with him so that Zusi would take all responsibility.
Who, on the other hand, could be offended for these days, because to allocate his prison conditions, requested home arrest, but he was rejected.
While many authors of very higher economic crimes, who have never returned the money, have passed freely or at least can wait in their own home, he does not have the possibility for it.
Psychology of the surplus: Why do we cost more money?
Participants of the substances are intended to cost more money and overvalue the product.
The neurological and economicists of the University of New York discovered the neurological bases of this known and apparently irrational conduct.
It is the study shown in the Science magazine, people don't want in competences such as eBay subests, so they prefer even a price.
The scientists have established the neurological scheme of this "play" through experimental substances.
One of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in a subasta, and while so long it was examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the subests, where it is a fundamental element to apostate more than the other, the game intensified the function of the extremely called complex located below the brain cortez.
This brain area, as well as many other functions, plays a role in the "auto premium" mechanism of the nervous system.
As a result of scientists, the increase in appeals is explained as a prevention to not providing an intense reaction to the street.
In order to fundamentalize their theory, the economicists of the Scientific Group also conducted a financial monitoring study.
In this experiment, three groups were attacked against one person in different circumstances.
The control group simply communicated the real value of the product concerned, and its integrants had apostated.
Another group was also promised that if they wined, they would receive more than $15.
Instead, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the substance, but in the case of substances, the group's integrants even lost that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for another the failure.
However, by checking the neurological hypothesis, the members of the group playing " against the failure" were willing to apostate even more than the members of the control group and the "ganator group".
"These results cannot be deducted from any previous economic theory.
After that, even now, they explained the phenomenon of the subests only with the joy of winning and prevention of risks.
Only the visual neurological methods helped to solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we are now reaching a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York Economy.
Hepatitis: What should you go to the doctor?
In the world, about fifty million people suffer from hepatitis B or C chronic, and in Hungary the chronic heat disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of counters in this country is calculated in hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the people do not know that they are counted.
Hepatitis name is the common name of different hygiene diseases caused by virus.
Symptoms seem to be much; the effect of hygado and ictericia is characteristic, but their patogen agents and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogeneous agent are propagated in two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or contingent food), hepatitis B, C, D and other virus with blood and body humor (sperma, vagina humor, saliva).
Travelers are recommended to be protected by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consumption of infected food is shown by a bad general state, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, they appear in the skin and in the white eye the ictericia, the excrement is made clear, the dark orine and the curation can dure even two - three weeks.
Annually a million people die in the world in cancer and hepatitis B hepatitis, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason is that the calculations are being taken, only one of each ten counted receives pharmacologic treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: without treatment, hepatitis C can produce hepatic and even cancer.
Most of the countyers don't know that it's fair because this pathological agent ruins the hygado cells in paulatin form and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
It is therefore very important that pre-traditional recognition, systematic medical control.
This disease is much more frequent in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattoos.
Now there are about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can also be discovered with a routine control, it deserves the penalty to consult the family doctor by experimenting some unknown symptoms.
The disease has curation if it is discovered at time, it is possible to eliminate the body’s virus, so the county can be removed and prevented from cancer.
On 30 September, the World Day of Hepatitis was organized for the first time in 2004 by representative organizations of the Hepatitis.
Its goal is to call attention to the causes of the chronic heat infections caused by virus and the importance of their pre-release recognition.
Do you hurt at least whom you believe in God?
It is the result of a recent research, religious faith has a calm effect that also delighted the death of the Catholicism martyrs.
The scientists of the University of Oxford performed an interesting experiment: they examined how religious faith affects human pain - reported the British Telegraph Journal.
In the context of this unique experiment, the shock applied to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results of the Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to human brain scan technology, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of investigations in which academics also participate in scientists, filosofs and theologists in the various departments of the University.
The analysis occurred in the following manner; they set an inspective instrument at the left hand of the patient, which applied the choc of the rough.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their look at two paintings; the Virgen Maria, the work of Sassoferrat in the 17th century and the Lady of the Army of Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers had the hope that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious encouragement among the faithful, as they chose the oil of ­ because it was not too different than the other, and they thought he had a peaceful effect.
Patients passed a half hour in a MRI scanner, receiving 20 shocks in four successive parts while watching the religious or well the other.
The Catholics said when looking at the Virgin Mary, they felt in "security" as people "protested", "suspended and in her heart reigned peace."
When they observed the religious theme table, they felt a 12 percent less of pain than when they looked at the work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such impacting image, it can be achieved similar effect to the atheis also, it is only necessary to find the appropriate image.
"We should find the trail of a person who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the research.
"The exercise of faith should, and in many cases of truth, changes our personality," Wright acknowledged.
After these amazing results, one questioner remains: What would be the effect of regulating the pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of էo or of another pintor of his wheel?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary raise even better results?
You're what you say about yourself
In its tenth anniversary, Google can be found: you can find both in the people's bottle and in the sky above their head; you know where their vacations passed, to which doctors visit and what's interesting you.
But if Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, the skeptics who make a parallel with orwelian vision do not see the existence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt has recently stated to the Financial Times magazine that the main goal of Google is to gather the most possible personal data about its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goals of the founders of Google: "We gather all the information of the world in a system!".
It is the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that has revolted the World is still at the start phase of the power to treat all the information.
At the question what will happen within five years, Schmidt answered this way: I want Google to answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the work that would be better to me?" - However, the software will not respond to questions apparently so simple as there are no enough user information.
Not all internalutes are conscious that during their network navigation key words, IP addresses and pages where the search ended.
For example, the Personalized Search that he debuted two years ago, users can store their own navigation history, can again consult what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic, the recommendations will be based on which the system will offer us products and services based on previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they use my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - those users who are concerned about seeing Google's information monopolie.
In most cases, the potential represented by the company is what may be fearful and not remortal, fear of punishment, anxiety for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that they are not only maintaining, but in justifiable cases, to third parties, all the expressions seeked, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of the international people.
The most debated example of the last times was perhaps the coordinated action against the Brazilian pedofils, when Google delivered the Brazilian government the information on your website, called Orkut, to identify the pedofils.
Instead, the internalutes concerned about the rights of the people, in May, when the company with the EFF, an organisation for the defence of electronic rights, showed successfully before the court that had the right to the FBI: if the sentence was, it could not be obliged to Google, by means of any of the points of the constitution to provide any type of information requested by the FBI secretly.
(In the same time, the Federal Government achieved its pretext to strengthen the law on the protection of the approved finance years ago, approximately fifty thousand web addresses and some thousand searching phrases, but without obtaining the lists of search from individual users, nor the full lists of web pages and key words in the last two months.)
This is a pretty contradictory view of Google: those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that they are threatening their intimity, their private life when they start using Google services, and are rebelled against it as against multinational image companies.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internal and users of other countries, see in them the future generation, "vanguardian corporation", not so to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by his Windows as the world conquist, for both fighting for the same purpose.
This can happen because Google does not ask users to identify any code or money for their applications, the code is open and the free software package is continuously updated and seems younger, more co-operator than the official gigant practice of software.
But it may also be because the geeks see exactly the very difficult relationship between people's rights and the Internet that just occurred by one of the key words mentioned in the last years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about co-operation, to leave winds behind us and to use the available communication channels, and while these measures are different individually, the essence is still the same: show us ourselves.
A normal young man can have a profile on many collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and even can join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, which provides a list of its music habits, after these can include them in a monitoring system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo gallerys are automatically shown in the Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases of which, for example, the girl, seeing the floor of graphics of the morning after the common friends, knows who passed the night before his fraudulent boy or can delay the employer of a company because this writes his sincere opinion in his blog on the direction of the company: one thing is safe, the definition of the private life is completely revalued.
The life "on line" of a person is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the conduct of the youth of our days.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to swim the Google monopolie, can do it (for example, by starting with the Scroogle that uses the Google search system, but does not let it go).
There are many people who don't want to register on collective pages to avoid finding them, but they can replace Google's "online" applications from the text editing software to image and reading news applications with alternative versions that are not connected to gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
The public opinion expects almost openly the day when Google shows his true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars values more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense publicity surfaces threaten the income of the publicity agencies, so that services that are introduced more rapidly cause serious head pains not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
However, critical observers will also find alarming contradictions: for example, the higher direction of employees, in turn, the protest of the employees after duplicating the price of the childguard of the company, considered too far the unlimited number of feeding employees, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google had passed before the pressure of the Chinese government and the company was filtered all information to violate the good moral and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the Internal Regulations of the Company says that they will not announce any new service with antelation, but only when it was ready to work, that if it is sure that the problems of the next months and years will be able to resume the world: while some believe that the project of scanning and file of books and magazines of Google will buy such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our own whole health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google will create a genetic database, it can provide a good primary material for the writers of science works, the Scroogled, the news of the Populary of Cory Doctorow, describes the future in orwelian way, in which only a man of Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two elderly men helped to delete the bottles to the dual murderer of the city of Ozd.
The police asked two minors of age about the double murder of Ozd who, as a doubt, helped to delete the currencies - on Tuesday, the Commissioner of the General Public Order of the Province of Borsod said.
Young people recognized the crime they were imprisoned, and they are currently accused of crime faults.
The two minors - if the information of the Hungarian News Agency is about two girls - they can be defended freely.
For complication, you can receive up to 5 years of prison.
The accusation of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - is in prevention arrest since Sunday .
The crime is accused of murdering a number of people with premeditation and code.
Research has been revealed that 23-year-old young man had a large amount to a 53-year-old man.
The accused didn't want to pay his debt, so the midnight of the last week he quoted his creditor at the seat of an Ozd company, where he killed him and then killed the 9-year daughter of the victim.
Informations of the MTI, the young man was prepared much before to commit crime, because he committed the murder with a previously hidden weapons in the place of crime.
The police analyses with a expert to the weapons and conditions of its use.
The Bolsa de Varsovia presented a offer for purchase of Praga
The Values Board of Varsovia offered two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech Crowns - for a hundred percent of the actions of the Prague Values Board.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Values Board of Varsovia, confirmed the offer made by the Polandians, although the Czechs previously excluded the Varsovia Board of the possible new owners of the Prague Board.
The reason is that Varsovia Bolsa is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State which wants to sell 60 per cent of them within a few months.
The Czech Economic Journal E15 reported that the proposal of the Polands was the highest among those offered by the interested parties by the Prague Board.
The Czech press is offered, until now, the Vienna Bolsa, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Bolsa, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Bolsa and the Deutsche Börse.
Peter Koblic, the leader of the Prague Values Board, declared last week that among the interested people the worst owner would be the Values Board of Varsovia and did not dismiss the possibility that, in a future, the Prague Values Board disappeared.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Board in approximately 5 to 10 billion crowns.
The agreement of the staff could be sold approximately 90 per cent of the actions.
The largest owner of the Praga Values Board is the investment of Patria Finance with a part of 25 per cent, follows the Cesská Sporitelna Bank with 14,7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5 percent.
About the financial crisis from the view of the European press
The main European journals in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the most deepest international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is to the North American President - considers the Roman Republic - the President has not been able or if it is able to obtain its own party's support for the draft legislative carefully made, whose goal is to solve this unexpected situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", of which the multimillionary investor Warren Buffett, it is more proper to talk about a "second 11 September".
It's a part of the maternity pressure, Washington is the expiational wheel.
In the opinion of the World, the error of the United States' political direction was that led to the world economy to the border of abism.
Increases the risk of the decoration of the North American monetary system, and this will then affect the world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the vote of the convention, the danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to treat the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the largest transformations of capitalism history is carried out.
You can't make an offense to this threat - point the Days-Anzeiger of Ginebra.
Some states today can still bring a salvation circle to the tambalaean financial institutions, so that they can save them from the silence with the money of contributors.
But if as the domino is still more deceived, then the new funds will be no longer enough, nor the new improvisations.
The European Union's Member States need a long term to leave their nationalist egoism on one side and centralize the control on fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis only received more than 100 billion euros on Monday - replies Der Standard Venus, adding that the concerns are more real than that, as the North Americans did, also European contributors must pay much money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not been seriously occupied with the crisis that occurs as a conname by the Continent Year .
"Salvators" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but would it be good if they definite: in what cases is it justified to use the funds of contributors to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car imitates the flight of the beach
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, unless the imitation of existing obstacles in nature?
For example, the one of the babes.
In an exciting project presented in the CEATEC of Japan, the battles gave the point of partition for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of the collection prevention systems.
Nissan, in collaboration with the University of Tokio, designed the robotic engine management system of type BR23C imitator of nature, which gave her the characteristics of the advantages, with the final objective of creating a system that could eliminate all collisions.
Flight every morning creates its own special ovaled space that actually looks very like our security protection capsule - explained in the exposure of Kazuhhiro Doi, the Technological Director of RP and Development and Research.
They play an important role in the composed eye of the bullets that are able to see in all directions in an angle above 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composed eyes, the engineers used the me system of the length by laser rays.
This identificates the obstacles before the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, in an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that is immediately transformed into a handicap to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds, the obstacle is identified, and then the vehicle's robot is imitating the movements of the beaches, and the direction is changed by turning the wheels to the necessary measure.
In contrast to any existing system currently, this handiop is totally instinct.
"If it wasn't so, the vehicle's robot couldn't repeat with enough speed as to scan the obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the project of vehicle robots.
Reactivate immediately and instinctly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable internal layer of the security capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
All the process must reflect what a bullshit makes to swim others.
This process must be carried out in an open and close the eyes.
However, in the contrary to the bathrooms, the movement cannot be moved up, down or diagonal, but it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of roads
Instead of the infinite possibilities for the bathrooms to swim others, here only used as a possibility for the robot of the car to rotation and acceleration, as well as frenage.
BR23C uses litio-polymeter battery which are lighter and is greater than its energy density, which means that they have a longer life duration than the litio-ion.
It is Andoh, the important thing is the instinct and intellectual reaction and not the data processing capacity, not much less than the storage.
This apparatus in each second only must process some input signals and re-evaluate if it is the case.
It is not necessary to store these data or repeat with an instinct logic based on the data of the previous handbooks, so it uses only a few decades of memory.
Gigabytes or megabytes are not required.
This is the first step to develop the technologies to swim the obstacles immediately, which is calculated by Nissan, within ten years can be incorporated into the models made in series.
Another possibility for its application is to integrate the unit in the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to its destination, smoking the existing obstacles on its road.
He's already the name of this lovely kid.
The written version of the 700 billion funding package has been prepared, which will be applied at several stages with the purpose of buying the bad credits of the resources.
At the first stage the half of the money will be costed.
It was timely from the Eastern Coast during the new consultations held up to the midnight of the Sabbath, the leaders of the assembly reached an agreement in return to the 700 billion dollars in total, after several days of discussion - reported the King.
We have achieved an important progress - said Nancy Pelosi, democrate president of the North American Congress, and that there is only a need to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment taken on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, talking about the result of the commitment: this programme will work and will be yours but you need more measures. If Pelosi, it is not to save Wall Street but to return to the car of the economic.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, such as Sunday before the 8th night, is Washington's hour (or before the two morning morning, the time of Central Europe), without providing a spectacular shot in the bottles.
About the draft law referred to in the Law of emergency for the economic stability of 2008, the first Monday will vote on the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted Pelosi on the Sabbath night and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress reached during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - stated Tony Fratto, the Porter of the White House.
The programme is different from the original proposal of Bush administration to cost all 700 billion dollars to buy low-quality credit values.
Now only the half of the $700 billion can be costed, using 250 billion immediately after the Congress will probably vote on Monday, the Ministry of Finance will purchase credit, bad currency values and the destination of $100 billion other than the Chairman's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the 700 billion dollars can be costed after a new decision of the Congress.
The Financial Ministry can apply a combined tactic: it can be bought simultaneously bad, hypotechical and credit fund values, including other type-beneficial credits.
The purchase can be made in substances or in direct form - informed the competent persons of the ministry.
The Law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial portfolio guarantees concernful elements, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to pre-damages.
Henry Paulson said: The law assures the necessary financial means, which even can reach 700 billion dollars in order to satisfy the urgent needs of the North American financial system, to purchase bad financial means, to ensure or to prevent risks that could cause demoronisation of some large financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as they sign it - he agreed.
Instead, the heads of the stakeholders who are in charge and wait for State aid can count on the official limitation of their refunds, which the North American argot calls simply gold parasites.
Only in certain cases, payments will be limited, as well as limitations of the form of aid of the Financial Ministry.
The limitation means that if the Ministry purchases in the framework of a substance, an additional tax shall be imposed for the gold paracaids, unless the lack of the head is judged.
By purchasing rightly bad credits, the Government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the refunds of the heads are not exhausted.
Furthermore, existing gold parasites contracts will not be changed, limitations are only referring to new contracts to stimulate the participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the North American history that will be in force a legal limitation for the income of the General Directors - the Democrate Barney Frank, president of the Congress Committee, has recommended that measure.
In addition, the State has the right to purchase actions of participants in the programme, so the risk of contributors will be decreased, since they can finally even gain profits with the transaction as the economy is recovered and with it.
The draft law in the next five years shall present the Chairman a proposal to the Congress on the way to make contributors losses of the financial sector.
Of course, at both sides there were those who expressed their reservations in relation to the project.
This is not what the northern American citizens commanded us, which is not protecting the dollars of the contributors - stated the Republican Congressist of California, Darrell Issa.
Her democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures insisted on the same things that are responsible for the Wall Street dismortalation.

The highest price level of plastic and chemical materials resulted in significant increase in the chemical production prices (1.6 per cent).
A price reduction in petrochemical sector, (1.4 per cent), was produced in the production of machines and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as, in a minimum measure, in the processing sectors of wood (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, editorials and printers have not changed.
In the rest of the processing industry, an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent was registered.
In the supply of energy, gas, heat and water representing a significant weight within the internal trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was registered in August in the first month due to the effect of the increase in official prices from the first July.
In a comparison of a period of twelve months - in the national sales of processing industry, the largest price increase was registered in petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metabolism sector, an increase of 13,2 per cent was observed, while in the food, drinks and tobacco industry, of determining weight, was an increase of 11 per cent.
A reduction of prices was recorded in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of machines and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.

The next year will no longer be needed to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many opportunities to enter into force around 12 January the North American-Hungary agreement on the exoneration of visa - the External Affairs Minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarian residents.
In its opinion, "practically everything depends on the construction of the electronic system of access and control at the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the income premium will disappear, but the tourists must be registered before their outcome from the country of origin.
Since today, the Hungarian diplomatic head holds conversations in Washington.
It will be interviewed with the State Secretariat of Condoleza Rice with the Star of the Order of the Hungarian Republic and will support negotiations with the international policy advisers of candidates to the presidency, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
So Barack Obama, as well as McCain, are in favour of the financial rescue package of the people.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates to the presidency of the two major North American partys, assured their support to the 700 million dollars of the administration programme on Sunday, there are politicians who require the mission of the Minister for Finance.
The representatives of the Congress and the Administration, after negotiations of a number of days of marathon, announced on Sunday morning: a agreement of principles on the financial redemption package of the parties was reached.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and losing the frozen credit market became the central topic of the presidential election campaign.
both Obama and McCain want to demonstrate that they are more than their rival to remove the country from the economic crisis.
The latest issues, when the economic issues were placed in the first place, Obama again gained some advantage and disappeared McCain's advantage that had been obtained after the conference of the Republicans with Sarah Palin's candidature to the presidency.
In a campaign of Detroit, celebrated last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will quickly adopt the 700 billion dollar package law.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We need to act now and with responsibility... is in danger of employment, the advancement of you, as well as the whole industry and the stability of all the economy," he said before a majority of 35,000 people.
He did not benefit from the opportunity to qualify obsolete economic concepts of McCain.
In an interview granted to ABC McCain, he explained that "we'll all bring this to hard penalties... but it's not just a viable way."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control committee to the Minister for Finances and the limitation of the refunds of the executives, he insisted on it.
Obama declared to the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in consultations, instead he consulted the Minister every day.
The President of the Congress of Nancy Pelosi appointed the Sunday that the congressists would probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German speaking area
The group of de Capulet is intact, only that within its own group the most conscious electors have become the Der Spiegel on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Baviera.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a royal coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the e electronic e of the German magazine of Left Franz Walter, in its article "The Revolution of Baviera feeds her parents" analyses the reasons for CSU's wounding dramatics.
It is the known polytolog, the erosion of the CSU has been started much before the trist Beckstein-Huber had assumed its charge.
Society Christians for several decades were developing Baviera - and now just these modern citizens are those who give him the spot.
The change of one age is at the same time a problem of all the Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not absolutely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been provided for almost ten years ago: the inconscient hegemonium was disappeared from a state party.
Ten years ago, the CSU received 47.7 per cent in 1998, for the first time under 50 per cent since the fifty years .
This was repeated three years ago, in the elections of the Bundestag 2005, which is still during the period referred to in Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the consumer provincy of its progenitors .
Sociologists have been pronounced this 40 years ago, but in the ritme have been very wrong, but the secularization, the results of the Education and the seating of the North Germans in the developed regions of Baviera have had their negative effects on the faithfulness of the CSU electors.
Modernisation also increases the possibilities, and it also has political consequences.
The group of deity is intake, only that within the own group the most conscious, critical and testarised electors have become.
It is amazing that in the last weeks, the conventional groups of citizens were those who were far away from the CSU; autonomes, small industrials, bachillerates and diplomates.
The support to the CSU was thus reduced by less than 40 per cent.
The press (depresse.com)
The Conservative Journal of Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article "The Presidents of the Parties are very reserved in coalition issues" - it is concerned about the confused situation of the internal policy after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ to be mismissed in its internal matters.
The BZÖ is open in all the directions for negotiation, the green in turn do not want to consult on coalition yet.
The elections have already been held, now everything turns back to coalition; in the debate held in public television, the leaders of the party just left to see something of their bars.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of ÖVP, at the position of canciller.
He warned that they disapproval the era of Schüssel-Molterer.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted carefully to the red offers.
He said that the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann is involved in the internal issues of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposite or enter the coalition, these issues must be discussed without doubt within the own ÖVP.
The President of BZÖ, Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black coalition, we are willing to take the government's responsibility" said Hader.
Jaróka: It must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Country for Equality of Opportunities has been started in Paris, and its employee is France that this year is also a representative of the European Union's turnover.
Livia Jaróka, member of the European Popular Partie by Fidesz, in its message addressed to the full, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to the segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that cause Gitan children and is also the greatest obstacle to predict their interests.
This high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for employment, social and equal opportunities.
Representatives of Governments, European social interlocutors and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organizations have assisted.
Jaróka - was the press office of the Fidesz Group in the European Parliament - warned that Gitanians remain out of the work market first for their lower school level.
"The majority of the young Gentiles have not finished the average education and because of the bad quality of basic education, only one insignificant part can obtain university diploma."
Jaroka also highlighted that education, as a fundamental human right, has a determining role in the predicting of the other human rights.
Investment in the education of Gitan children at a early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
Euro-Mitglied, these issues are needed to be largely conscious of both the Gitanians and the non-Gitans.
As long as the school begins early a gitane student, more opportunities will be to become a active member of the work market; they will also contribute to the national budget for taxes to rent and consumption.
"The Gitanians, as citizens of the European Union, must ensure the right to quality education and ensure the abbolition of the separate and low-level education," said Livia Jaróka.
The European Union's objective and active unit is needed to accelerate school deselection processes immediately, so it is essential that the right implementation of existing and planned antidiscrimination directives is essential.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we need to offer Gitan children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights" – Jaroka.
The objective of the European Country for Equality of opportunities organized annually since the last year Berlin meeting held in the sign of the "European Year of Equality" is to ensure a single forum to promote abolition of discrimination and equality of opportunities at European level and at national level of Member States.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision on the happiness of the failure of Huber-Beckstein will be taken
Despite the severe electoral destruction, no heads have yet been cut in the CSU boxes, the debate on personal issues has now been posted.
Erwin Huber, Chairman of the Party and Günther Beckstein, the Prime Minister of the Province still remains in its posts, but it is not known until it will dure grace.
The happiness of the Partie, who suffered a 17 per cent electoral disaster, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party that will be held on the last end of October.
The integrants of such a criticised person have allowed them to enter into: they do not affect their positions so much.
This means that the furious members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization would be quiet, which one day after the "sunami bavaro" were personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was on the top of his career - the social union reaches 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the battle against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopolie" in Baviera, which gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the provincy of the South, of key importance for Hungarian economy, conservators continue to predominate, in the future, they must without doubt make coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the repository of the party, President Horst Seehofer, Federal Ministry of Agriculture, one of the possible successors of Huber, also has a position in the reduced intellectual group that starts negotiations with the free FDP and with the Free Deal Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange destination is that in the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used for the fight of Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly removed from the scenario to the local ambitious policy.
The maximum leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energy to stabilise Beckstein.
In the transition, it will also receive an active role of Stoiber that until now has moved the ovens to the foundation, the former province and former chairman of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the worst day of its political career.
The Monday Huber made some critical observations to the CDU, in its opinion they would have deserved much more support for the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the destruction as a warning for the CDU and for its own Angela Merkel.
After the elections of September 2009 of Bundestag, Merkel may not be cancer if they are not able to play together with the CSU that played a transient role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
It is Merkel that hard penalties could hide their deception by failure, the losses of the CSU will not affect negatively on the big Berlin coalition.
What is naturally related: it will not be easier to treat the vulnerable CSU and the continued social democratic crisis.
The SPD with its 18,6 percent alcan’s worst result since 1946 in Baviera.
The opposite of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the elections of Sunday, there will be no member or member in the Belarus Parliament.
The Russian observators, this is explained with the welfare and stability guaranteed in the country of Alexandr Lukashenko, in turn the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe (OSCE), and this is well explained by violations of the law under votes.
The OSCE who sent 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognize the electoral result.
Although the legislation of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated by hundred and ten Members, has no opposition for more than one decade before the elections of yesterday the opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukehenko, who four times renewed its mandate after the elections of 2006, would be "permitted" by the amendment of the Constitution this time to introduce some Members of the opposition to the parliament.
So ODSZ removed the boicot that originally wanted to do.
In the fund of the expectations of opposition, the Belarus, which always is more economically dependent on Russia - which has taken a credit to modify the import of natural gas every time more face from Russia and contributed to the sale to Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relationships with the European Union, which does not give him the authorisation of income to Lukashenko and other high-level politicians for having an antidemocracy political regime.
It was a sign of distance when the OSCE, when evaluating the electoral campaign, focused more on positive and not on errors - such as the participation of a third of the candidates in the opposite.
However, the primary report of the OSCE Monday criticized even the campaign - in which the candidates of opposition could not appear in the press - and in particular that the opposite could not be present in the context of votes.
However, in view of the opposition, there is a improvement in the political climate: the political prisons have remained free, and Minsk is available to a small comparison with Moscow, refusing the recognition of the separation of South Osetia and Abhasia of Georgia, although Russia - with which theoretically Belarus is a Federal State - a month ago that considers both regions as independents.
- We have given two steps forward and one back, but the most important is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has been started - declared to our magazine Alexander Milinkevich.
The candidate to the opposite of the presidential elections of 2006 is desirable to maintain this situation, although "the regime fears to allow the income of such a person in this Parliament without weight".
The opposite does not plan to organize protest manifestations by seeing the results, rather than make the electors their message on the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we should print the pressure of opposition in Russia, local authorities make difficulties before their distribution, but even so I see that they are more supporting the change between the elderly also - said Milinkevich, with a statement that the Lukehenko regime, which believes that their main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate or if the judges are officially the most subvencioned by the regime.
Because of the country's debt and the increase in commercial deficit, it is only a question of time to decomposition of social security that "seems like the silence of the cementary" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers against the opposition policy qualified democratics to elections.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the Community of Independent States, declared to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe not in words but in facts," so the lack of opposition is not other than the witness of the matureness of the Belarus electors.
Brunetta: "From now in more time, it's disappointed before the start of working"
It has never happened in the Chigi Palacio History that would put automatic doors to control the input and output of the staff.
But since today, he starts with this measure against who is packed and then goes to the bar to take a café at work time.
This newness has been presented today by the Minister for Public Affairs, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary-General of the Council's President Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors," says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" needs the Minister.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency is now opened.
This is Reformism," she subrays Brunetta again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all the Council Presidency buildings.
For Masi "the choice of automatic gates is also important from the Simbiotic Viewpoint".
No resistance was found by employees, assured the Secretary-General: "a change has been made by the workers and the cooperation has been part of them."
Finally, no longer delay in working time; no more coffee and middle months.
The word of Brunetta, which suggests, dreaming, "a good capuchino at the 7th morning is a holy hand."
A convention at the Superior School of the Publication
of Rome, the Minister states that "in three months the disabilities of public employees have been reduced by 50 per cent, meaning 60 thousand more at work in a year".
And adds that it is necessary to make public training more effective
Italian, "the salarial dynamics – explains the Minister – have been doubled in the last 8-10 years with regard to the private sector and well above the inflation rate."
For now, millions of public employees have been united to oppose the rules of Brunetta decree by reaching the request supported by the Codacons.
"When the Ministry of the Public Function shows the numbers, the smaller labour unemployment for diseases -- writes the consumer association – the people of the 'vag workers' is continually increasing .
In Italy, millions of employees of the right and productive public administration are actually united to declare war to the illegal rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar was responsible for the exclusion of economic treatments aggregated by disease due to service; the assembly of timelines in which the medical control visits of the employee were carried out and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
A workshop, Napolitan: " crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are checked, 3 people die, and 27 remains permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths have been approximately ↓00.
Digits that testify the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost the duplicate of dead in relation to murderers.
To call on the attention of institutions, social forces and media information on this dramatic issue, the Anmil today celebrates in all Italy's provinces the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents, instituted on Sunday second October.
"The concernful data distributed by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirms how crucial the issue of prevention in the work is," in the message sent to the Chairman of the Anmil, the National Association Mutilated and invalid by the work, Peter Mercande.
The head of the State expresses its "great appreciation for the continuous associative efforts for prevention in the workplace, the protection of lossed workers, the assistance to victims' families and the public opinion."
"A 'basta', honestly expressed, has been manifested to tragedies that, by its dimensions, arise the cry of the media and the participation of the public opinion, in turn, the daily reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamic."
Napolitan does not hide that " there is no doubt a resource problem: it is determined to invest in training and information.
In particular, many promoted initiatives in the field of school for more direct consciousness are taken from young people who enter the world of work.
It is a need to maintain lifely attention to the phenomenon, not to breathe the alarm on social seriousness, to apply and improve legislation rules.
By its part, the Chamber President Gianfranco Fini subrayed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offers the conscience of each of us and makes all institutions a decision to put an urgent end."
"Data on accidents in the work seems to indicate a low positive walk, but this does not remove the number of white deaths too impressive," commented the President of Anmil Pietro Mercante.
"We don't really want this "decrease in decrease" to be translated in less attention, because it's just when the attention decreases that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at general level too little is done to contrary the accident phenomenon and the medicine can be exercised to multiple actions.
They are needed, to our criteria - has highlighted Mercande · greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world. "
"There is a further effort - it has added - why it consists of the communication and employment of the public opinion.
But it serves, in particular, a greater sense of responsibility from employees with regard to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercande日 has declared "the deteriorated progressive level of subsidiary protection for the victims of the work" and "the assistance deficiency to which the system is being addressed in recent years".
"The goal is to restore the security guarantee to the worker - it has added – because the happiness of the accident is not required to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers under accusation, risk audition
Listen to high volume music for a long time using computer musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent lesions to hear.
It refers to the European Commission, that in a broadcommunication in Brussels, the Commission's opinion on the emergency and recently identified health risk (Cssseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this sensible opinion – it is read in the note – is that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, hear music with computer musical devices weekly for more than one hour per day having the high volume device risk a permanent loss of auditive capacity."
"I worry about the fact that such a high number of youths that often use computer musical devices and mobile telephones at high axis level can unconsciously destroy their ears in irremediable manner," -- Meglena Kuneva.
"On Scientific Tests - follows the responsibility Ue - there is a clear risk and we must repeat quickly.
What the fact is, it is to make consumers and to provide this public domain information.
We have reexamined, in addition, the existing control systems in light of this scientific opinion, so that they are extensively effective and have the step with the new technology."
Brussels had requested the Cient’s Independent Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of computer musical devices and the increase in the number of young ones exposed to the voice that originates.
"The scientists - concluded the executive Ue - confirm that it is a reason for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and the interested parties that measures may be adopted for better protection of children and adolescents from the exhibition of the voice resulting from computer musical devices and equipment."
Currently, there is a European security standard that limits the volume level of the computer musical devices to 100 dB, but anxiety increases as the auditive damage that can result from an exposure to such sound sources.
It is possible to limit many of these damage by repeating solutions such as the reduction of levels and the time of exposure to the voice.
In its opinion, the Committee Cient日 Ue presents that the users of computer musical devices are listening to a high volume (master 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit for the maximum time of the job.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of auditive capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that 5-10% of the users of such equipment and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, German gives the Commission the way for the future of capital
Today, in March it is closed, the accounts will be made in June.
This is the calendar fixed by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Room Capital Futute", which has been established this morning in its new seat behind the Caracalla Terms.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will deal with the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the assembly and the common advice would evaluate analysis and projects, in order to present the Strategy Plan for Rome in June with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its inevitable Gianni German.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – intended to subscribe Germany – will provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the assembly and the municipal advice will then be able.
There is no overall position of roles, but only the will to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – announce the inevitable – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of the capital of Rome."
To whom the Commission is accused of unusual, since its opinions are not binding, the German answers: "All depends on the work that will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission, as well as I am sure in Rome, it will be fundamental.
Policy is almost always involved in the management and in events that return to return.
In contrast, we want to look there and long-termly, in a deepest prospect, working seriously for the development of Rome and for its future."
The inevitable in Rome also intends to point out that "This Commission is not an unusual entity or a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to take part and reason for the best thoughts that the capital expresses."
For Germans, actually, "the needs to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or inmotive, to allow our city to make a level-shot, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a single spirit to his future."
A future that, precisely the inequivocate of Rome, was not only limited to the current communal borders but also to look there' not only in the optical of the future metropolitical city and its legal state of Capital but also "as regarding the role that Rome can and must develop as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti American president.
He wrote a American political note that cares for you to pass by independence: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, reduced the US economy and had relationships (as it also makes a private citizen today) with Mr. Islam."
Increases the attacks against Obama while closed to the date of elections.
a Miami lady wrote on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face of stone: he thinks he wins the highest charge of the nation who has two rulers and five black senators!".
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly appeals of racial nature and do not answer the question of the electors: Will it be a good president? And they are the sondees; everyone says Obama wins and with a good advantage.
In this case there is also one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A journal of the Mississipi, in the entrances of the South of the United States, wrote a editorial: once in the cabin to vote, we will well know who will vote the American patriot.
Get out one side of the mentality and holding it up to the last.
"Tell what they want, we'll think where to put the cross, if Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if you come to win Obama, we'll go out of America.
Never those things before now, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, however, all these reasons, the weapon wins for democratics is George Bush.
1500 people have requested: What errors have been made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent has answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent her home to the back.
In Iraq, there are 4500 soldiers who have lost life and the Americans have not been forced to make the Valleys.
Similarly, Iraq for most has been the weakest point of Bush.
Whoever takes George W's position will have a great debt to develop.
Use, the economic collapse is also made to the journalists: in the periods there is a time of courts. Many guilty the Internet, "assassin" of the printed role.
American journalists have been interpelled by ÂW Research Center on the status of their professional and mental control for the future.
But today the journalists are almost all pessimists about their future.
However, the journalists have not openly declared feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as one time.
The problem for journalists and journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastated economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the courts made in the room where the editors work to perform the periodic, is a great problem.
It is a problem that should be solved, interviewed journalists, if it is not wanted to reduce traditional periodism as the majority of the public.
A clear but complete pessimism predominates today about journalist and.
Six of ten journalists and executives are convinced that the periodism at national level is following a wrong way.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printing against emission.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The biggest editorial houses are opened a breach on the Internet, for many views such as the "assassin" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that the journalists warned has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are increasing technology in the hope of "doing something good" for the journalism.
The biggest rotation today in the American journalism is among whom the journalists – or directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of national executives are sure that their journalists have the same values, while at local level the percentage is lower to 23%.
For some, this has to be regarded with the "security of the work".
The executives who think of the job in 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the periodic staff is 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (on our editors, ndr) in America is always at the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a large nation such as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of magazines, magazines, radio, TV and Internet, people often offer what they want and become as a question of "to take or leave it".
Directors almost always receive good salaries, while the editors can win up to $10,000 per month, but the jubilation and social insurance.
For vacations, reasoning is made complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, by admission, are followed in the year.
It's all a climate issue.
UNIPOL: ROMA TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOL TO GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second penal section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to make the instance of the immobiliary Danilo Coppola who had requested to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated in the field of research on the contra-pacte on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arrest process , last week, has received the home freedom, has transformed it into obligatory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the immobiliary can run the city of the province to a capital room.
The court is, these trips (in which the pm has voted contrary) would allow you to influence its society and to the evidence they accuse it.
Elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been shown a few days ago with the vote of the representatives' room against the 700 million dollars plan of salvation in the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, but interested in punishing Wall Street to save the economy.
We have a confirmation of the New York Times of yesterday inform us that the current crisis is disarmating the Republican party, always more divided between its old age of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions and business, and its new age, in turn, preserving, enemies to "they of Washington" and the world of finance, strong, especially in the states of the Centre and South.
The soul, in fact, became prepotent with the vote of whom he spoke at the beginning.
This is just a example of the mutations, of the great mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but all the OÂe and not only here.
Or in the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to work as a accelerator of incubation phenomenon that with the new climate are solidified and out to light.
The first of these phenomenon is the re-actualization, extraordinary reactivation, of the two-soveranian state category in relation to a type of nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of financial institutions which, if strong financial relations have to be financed with the outside, but especially the balances of families living in one country and in one single state are much more committed.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for whom it is governed is how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically worldwide, but it is politically and nationally.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of game or they do not have much to say: The crucial evidence is the European Union that is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies cannot decide any common policy.
It is the Government of each state that all are expected to intervene, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules, and especially the subvention of funds: since the court is reached is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remediate things.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimation to use them: two incompatible value resources, values in certain circumstances where no market probably and no organisation can be available in the same measure.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the national state is perfectly synthetic, with the greatest importance when the new development of the economy is intended to assign it to a very associated factor to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxally, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of the technology always more sophisticated, of the inmaterial, while we were convinced that the global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future will change the accounts with little inmaterial things such as water, culture and petroleum.
All things that, in fact, can be truly transported from one place to another of the earth but are also in absolute manner in a strict space, a territory.
So whoever is sovereign, has certainly many more letters about whom it is not, and who has the despair of living in a place without cultivation, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second news, but it's a fraction.
He who says Territorium, State, Government, inevitate says Policy and Leader.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomenon.
On the one hand, the objective consciousness of the need for a leadership, the request of someone who knows to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a discreditation wall for existing leaders, of inadequate economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense inquiry: a disbelieving, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of deliverity, which aims to involve the whole leader class of the O©e countries in a growing number.
It seems to be more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elite until now in growth, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding of the term, having done their own time and to be more stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The request for leadership, in a few words, provides subterraneously a ramified but powerful movement of the leading classes and traditional policies, which are shown in a "revolution" electoral or in the repentant changes of collective humors of these recent times, since the outcome of conservation in Austria-Baviera to the collapsation of the social-democracy consciousness in Greece, to the rebellion of American congress men against Bush (and also with the victory of the deeper in Italy that has something to see).
It is the impression that traditional elites, their partitions, their programmes, but also their rites, their journals, their credited intellectuals, their format would say any more difficult to understand and then to represent, which from today's form is the deep strategy of the west society and that the economic crisis renewed, increased and acted potentially in dismeading.
In front of all this, talking about a "mass rebellion" today is honestly exagered.
But having open eyes, certainly, isn't it.
The super pigment to walk over the walls
Winning gravity laws thanks to a super pegment and in a future walking over walls like the aranish man.
It is the goal of several American research centres, and now a team of four institutions has been closed enough.
With only 2,5 centimeters squared, the citizens could have taken a body of 100 kilos over a vertical wall.
EL STUDIO – The American Scientific magazine has published the discoveries of some researchers from the Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of existing people who use a particular carbon, called carbon nanotics.
“The principle of the pigment can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a spaguetis pile” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired to the beach of the gecos, microscopic hair reapparents that can ensure the animal a perfect adherence.
The tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflone and paper, have shown that the new adessive is ten times more powerful of the foots of this reptil and at the same time "speaks easily from the walls," explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton Engineering.
PAY FOR THE PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as transitional adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through walls exactly like the aranish man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinant use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotics are warm and running drivers.
Other applications could have to see with space engineering.
No superheroes for the moment.
OUTER INVESTIGATION - Also the Berkeley University, in California, is dedicated to the search of a new adhesive.
In a article of the American Chemical Society, Californian studies have presented an adesitive factor of micro fibres as hairs that are self-employed by the powder during the movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: Never with fruit game
Attention on the pomelo game, the naranja and the bottle.
These drinks, especially consumed in the soil because they are refreshing and rich of vitamins, if they are taken simultaneously with some medicines, their absorption is changed by enhancing or reducing the case, the disease with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit games, freshly associated with the assumption of some medicines of David Bailey, professor of the Western Ontario University in London, which from the 236th national meeting of American Chemical Society in the course of Filadelfia sends a new alarm: enough for a pomelo, narrow and manzana game to reduce the absorption of some medicines, canceling the benefits and risking the health of patients.
The pomelo game was already under accusation because it was maintained responsible for toxic increased some antibiotics, antibiotics, antibiotics, antihistamines and neurological medicines.
FARMACEUTICAL A RIESGOS – The same Italian pharmaceutical agency had given the news in a two-year information bulletin alarming doctors and patients not to subestimate the danger that resulted from this mixture and to take care of what it drinks in the case it was assuming a medicine such as Diasepam or the Metadone.
NOT SOLO THE POMELO – Experts are also the narrow game and the manzana contain substances that inhibit the medicines.
A long list of active principles inhibited by pomelo and other games.
From here the name of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milano: "These discoveries are generally listed to the various international and national farming agencies which may be changed by the information notes of it.
Therefore, you must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that does not make us clear, let us not be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmaceutic," the expert of the Agency Ansa subscribed.
The Economy News to Paul Krugman
The noble economic premium has been assigned to the American Paul Krugman by its studies, trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a chinesian nine who speaks to the Princeton University and is a New York Times editorial note.
Krugman is one of the largest critical decisions of Bush administration in respect of economic and external policy.
A few months after the attention of September 11 of 2001, in those days, Enron breathed, Krugman had planned in a editorial published by New York Times that the second event would be more determined than the first, at the consequence of the United States.
A predict that I draw a lot of polemic and that for several years, the economy has been approximately manifested.
“I am surprised and a little worried about how the memory of Enron and Worldcom's scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
If Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Affairs, Krugman is a "economy of great value" but also a developer with a "agressive, particularly critical style against the liberalism of Bush's administration".
Open Office, I'm the third and third of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It's the day of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that is trying to attract more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as free alternative to the known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year of voluntary developers, of which their spades are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: on the screen of welcome and the newspaper interface less gross, other more consistent, such as the compatibility of the Apple Mac OS X operational system and the support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) ­, the last ISO standard version.
Attention also made to multifunction with the Office suite Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the documents with the new Microsoft Office (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, some specific functions of some modules such as which allows to reduce the dimension of PowerPoint presentation, for example, to send it via email, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphical processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front can be created "hibrid PDF" documents, which collect the typical graph of the Adobe format with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text designer.
Cooperation is an element that has received various improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of changes, in the texting process, each partner is given a colour in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to carry out some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be handled at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and I add to the English in the mirror since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is available for the Linux operating system.
A request may also be sent to the home or working CD.
And if the theme of freedom can be a gap for the diffusion in the houses, it is in business area that Open Office is the suit test, the big appeal, which can already account with several projects made in the public administration and schools.
And they do not miss the facts that provide a perfect training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business perspectives could be opened.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the video write the corresponding Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that substitutes Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint presentation; Dbase, eat in the case of known Access is the program that can work on the base date; and last Draw the graphical module.
The aim for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand until today, with the outcome of the new version, it is possible to overcome the estimated number.
Kohl also results positive is the fourth case of do
New positive case in the France tour: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best recompense of the scaler.
The news is the site of the magazine The Team.
Kohl, 26 years is the fourth corner at the Epo of Third Generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccó and Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, they also from Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl's blood campaigns comes between those performed in the last weeks in Losanna and Chatenay-Mala.
If tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will be the third place in the Tour and wrath against the two years of Canonic disqualification.
Confirming the news of the positive donation of Kohl to the Epo of Third generation is the head of the French antido agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year Austrian has been placed in the podium at the spanish widths of Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, adjudic is the reward of the best scaler.
INMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES WORK, ITALIA IS RACISTA?
Italy of emigrant country has been transformed only recently to a privileged destination for immigrants" accepted with enemy.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racistes? This is what New York Times is asking in a long article that has dedicated the debate on racism in Italy as part of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milán because he stole a box of galletes.
This case shows what New York Times defines the "Northern Paradise": Northern regions are at the same time those where "meer integration and more work" are recorded but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the highest support of the North liga.
As confirmed by the growing stress between Italian and immigrants, the New York Times also quoted the episodes of intolerance in Milán, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new law that the Law loves also approves the immigration freno and facilitates the exemption of clandestins is mentioned as a paradigma of climate change in Italy.
The tendance was noted by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Georgio Napolitan finding Benedetto XVI in the Congress has requested that the State and the church work together to fight racism."
Students of the carrier's victims, up to 900 euros for a room
The acquisition market for universities does not know the crisis.
The last survey of Sunia, the inquiry officer, was acquiring a single room, which could cost a student of 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Napoles, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already taken very serious features until the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the highest costs that the family should support," explains the responsibility for the Sunian study office Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong request has completely deformed the market in such a point of designing a generalized increase process for residents.
In addition, in most cases, the sales offers contain a series of violations: free, not registered contracts, without canon limits, under liable acquirers.
It is necessary for Sunia extraordinary interventions that, in the review of the tax tax, prices may be regulated.
Seeing in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, by a bed in Brianza, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from at least 650 (Sware Bande Zone) to a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) at a maximum of 900 (in Victoria).
In Florence, a layer costs a average of 350/400 euros, a room of approximately 700 euros.
In Bolivia, where students are focused on the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) you ask about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas nearby other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
Economy is made only if peripheric area is changed: EUR 300 per a bed and 450 per a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and around.
In Napoles for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 per individual.
in the youngest cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the town's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of students and extracommunications is more frequent, a further anomalie is recorded: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students in relation to Italian.
Bye to the old Chinese Paradiso, cities cancel historical rooms
History cinematographic rooms are closed by promoting the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematography rooms in a blind city is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore is effectively graphing what is happening in the large Italian urban centres and also in province cities.
The marginalization process of cines, which, with the birth of large metropolis in the periferia and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indispensable event with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
By disappearing almost always are historical places, full of memory," and as if a friend died, a known person with whom there was a place and so much emotion”, observes the director of the new film Paradiso, the film that 20 years ago I wined the first Oscar and the great price of the jury to Cannes, which counted the poesie of a provincy cine room and nostalgia for the way of living the movie that may be lost forever.
The numbers given by the Anec, the main business association, are clear: In the past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay the majority are especially the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bolonia and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most suffering regions of the closer are the first, Emilia-Romania with 82 less cines, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsibility for its disaster is the advancement of the multiplex, it is the own of these three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new Mexico cines: 195 screens but in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Toscana as in Emilia-Romania.
“The Italian exercise has been developed irrationally” notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec," it would be useful to build new → but it would be necessary to ensure the remaining of those already existing, because when a city room closes, not all of its frequencies are ready to transfer to metropolis.
For not talking about the lack of funds for trademakers, the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
It is confused from the ethical and moral point that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year.”
Interestingly, the case of Bolonia, the first Italian city that concerns the closes, decided to be repaired with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the mono room movie is in the historical centre and in the area.
There are between the rules provided for for tax facilitation for public managers and benefits in mobility terms: spectators can enter into the limited trade area and have special tariffs for stationing.
“This is a initiative that I like” notes Giuseppe Tornador and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bolognia by putting in place other measures.
It is true, in contrast with the extra power of Mexico, traditional rooms need to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more needed.
The traditional cine's defense is a subject that was always important for me: the closure of the Baggerian movie, the place of my fancy and adultery, was the chispa that convinced me to perform the "New Paradise New Movie", which I thought for 10 years ago.
I lived in Rome 25 years ago, and when I walked forward to the Rialto or to the Na¤Road Kirinale already closed, in which I lived so many emotions, so that I couldn't see the papers injured by the powder, I'm turning to the other side.”
The link between political and anrangheta has been arrested by the head of Gioia Tauro
"The chairman of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Municipal for interested in the Piroma cosca."
The accusations that the directors of the Anti-Mafia Director of Calabria give to the inevitant and 日 inequident of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the inevitable of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piroma, the elderly average between the clan and the public administration, and his boss' grandmother, who was already condemned by mafia criminal association and to pay 10 million euros.
"Despite any legal and moral standard, and in good sense," the applicants wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the will of paying consultations to a lawyer Piroma.
"It would have been allowed to the mafiosa family – the judges - to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and management of the public administration."
The President of the Regional Calabrés Agazio Loiero does not hide that there are " agreements between the organized wicked life" in its region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local political politicians who resist the pressure of the "Dranghete, heroes that are maintained".
The arrested tomorrow are added to those of the past Julio after the police had announced the court of the Mafiosa Piroma family.
Since the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipal advice had been disfellowshipped, since 1991 and always by conditions between organised criminality and local administration, local politicians had been raised from the obligation to administrate the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, inevitably from Udc at the time of the resolution, after the ballotage to May 2006, was chosen as a head of a centre coalition.
I explode a scandal when Prefecture orders the resolution of the municipal advice.
I call on the Ministry of the Interior that at that time was Marco Min日, accused of have organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piroma-- had even been asked for the change in the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptations made at Dal Torrione, judges write, "the ability to promote the needs of a businessman, representative of a very close group to the piroma class, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of mafios families".
When energy is born from the walls, the large ones go down to the scenario
It's an extermined yield that takes over 70% of the surface of the planet and are now discovering, the large global energy companies.
Olas, flowers, marines are the new renewable sources on which the biggers look like Chevron.
The possibility to recover energy from sea movements was studied since hundred years ago and in the 70s with the first oil crisis, research was intensified.
When the price of the low petroleum in 1980, the idea of use of marine energy was separated, but now the environmental cases and the new increase of oil are impulsed to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London has estimated for 2007 that 15 per cent of the need for the world’s electricity could be used by implants that explode the movement of the sea walls.
This amount would be the dual of the current production by nuclear centres.
And they would be the rivers and the sea.
Gigantes on the attack.
The first undertaking to appeal on marine energy was Enersis, which has signed in 2005 an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced, a revolutionary step appeared.
Two years of distant distance on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the ocean energy technology – has declared the carrier of a company associated with the cool oil and ­ the Wall Street Journal economy – and it evaluates the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation concerned is to obtain a authorisation of the Commission for Energy and Energy, to implement a project for the explosion of marine energy in Alaska.
It is a very important signal, if it is considered that the United States continue extracting petroleum in Alaska and recently the President Bush has enabled a plan to perform new perforations.
Besides Chevron is See > Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the way of energy coming from the sea, the total invested up to now, although they are not detailed indicate an increased interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts speak of a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts such as the Portuguese or the Céses are small and seems not to create big eco problems.
To produce long-scale energy, a technology should be used with a higher environmental impact.
And the options are different: Ocean Power, for example, use a system of good units between them.
The strength of the walls, which makes the goods move up and down, becomes pressure with pistons and cylinders within them.
Pressure turns a turbine to eat a generator at its time.
Electricity is sent to the coast to submarine caves.
For now there are four the implants of this type in developing ways, waiting only for federal approval, as part of energy, could serve for a military installation.
See > Power, however, produces already energy for a commercial centre and for a station, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when there are seasons, turns the turbines' palettes, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
See ́ she said she had a long list of clients at the expectation of the authorisations necessary to use energy.
After the walls, the hairs.
A particular interest, said in the Institute for the Development of the Energy Energy, deserves the potential of marine at present.
Although it is a intermittent phenomenon, the sea are more preventive than the wind, the sun or the walls, and therefore more reliable as energy source.
It is especially about the energy of the seamarks such as New York, Âe and Alaska, together with others close to the coasts, invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008, and a investment of 35 million for 2009 is expected.
