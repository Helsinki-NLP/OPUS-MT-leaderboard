The impact of zoom objectives is that the focusing and the number of line elements needed for a fuel wide range are much greater than for objects with fixed burning.
This problem will always be more important because the Linsen manufacturers have standards in the Linsen production.
Thus, with zoom objective images could be created in a quality comparable to the width of objects with fixed burning.
Another incidence of tele-objectives is that the maximum opening of bleeding (the speed) of the lines is usually lower.
Therefore, the valuable zoom objectives are difficult to use in situations with little light without worthless use.
