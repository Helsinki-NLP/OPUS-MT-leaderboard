Obama received Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
They both wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and the Teheran destabilising measures in the Near East.
At the meeting, however, it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stressed for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s advanced sedimental building and provides Netanyahu deficiencies in the peace process.
By the Department of Obama on the Iranian Atomic Programme, the relationship of the two has continued to be worse.
In March, Netanyahu had held a contested talk on the invitation of the Republicans before the United States Congress, which was partly considered as an affair against Obama.
The talk was not disappointed with Obama, a meeting was rejected with reference to the previous choice in Israel.
In a call, Professor shoot his friend
In a call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that the officers had to come home.
Lamb was important to show that his "soul dog" is still alive and probably surprised, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Printiss and a manually written note that was criticized on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to reject it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who loved me." This was according to the information of the authorities in the letter, and he was under Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who was in two online courses for the Delta State in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the schoolman, where he had shot and killed a popular historical professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to the office.
Delta State日 Police Chef Lynn Buford said that university workers have heard shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb had made sometimes the disgusting need.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when the police inquired him.
One day after the shooting at the University, the students and Doeen forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to make a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the employees at the two ends of the State, as well as what students and employees who knew him helped to make a picture of a talented, but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said they enjoyed his teaching.
The police in Göer, where Printiss died, said he had no history of violence or a crime story.
Schmidt himself had given the Lamb in a book written by him, in which he recognized the "wonderful people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both had been informed in the Department for Social Sciences and History, whose body included 17 members, and many students visited two courses.
At the same time, there were some distress on problems.
A student, Brandon Beavers, the Lamb praised, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikkel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the 2014-15 Academic Year.
Lamb had previously requested the Delta State a authorisation for health reasons and said he had any health problems.
In this year, he only taught two online courses.
The latest changes in the employment policy of the University indicated that the promotion for the Lamb would not be guaranteed for him for an automatic way to establish as assistant professor.
President of University William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but, of course, there was something in Mr. Lamb's view.
These are questions that the Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the flight from the campus, the police found Lambs track later when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, the Lamb killed himself with a .38 Caliber gun in a house's backhouse about a milk south of his parents' house at Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the car.
I didn't know why the Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grows up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3.500 students in a city with approximately 12.000 inhabitants and taught geographic and padagogic.
He promoted in Pédagogic in early year.
One of the long-yearly friendly Lambs repeated him as a intelligent, charistic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together friends.
She and her friends were at the High School, and he was the cool older man who tried to teach her the gitarr game.
He was the female warm at that time.
All girls smile there when he was there," Hairston said, now 40 and in the Jackson President of Brandon.
Lamb and printiss were obviously a few times together.
In the call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there were no urgency from a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the backstein house, which limited to a Bayou in Gqueler.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Printiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends were stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"He was totally cut off on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that the Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Printiss when he and Abigail arrived three years ago on a summer year.
Later they played together the one or the other guy.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sing her own music.
Printiss was a nurse who was online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes a chat coordinator at the Julep Room, a weakly light bar near Gگوer, said that he saw Lamb and Printiss Night on the night 5 September the last time after the lamb ended his gitarr and mouthharmonic game before a spiral public.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were at the cleansing, and we were broken together.
I mean, they both had a good sense for a screen.
Schmidt, the dead Professor, guided the first seminar and specialised the original and colonial history of the first seminar, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State in Kansas and was the President of his brotherhood and the Committee of Students.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people took part on Thursday, about 900 people, Do月en, workers, students and members of the community in a memory feast.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also shared in the Maastricht Watch while the University School "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The education will be recovered in the middle of the week.
"We're trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of health.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now said that Lamb had made the call after he had shot Schmidt, and that the Lamb in respect of the call of Printiss was rejected as his wife, but there is no indication that the two had ever married.
Toys R Us plant to set less work forces for Wednesday
Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Wednesday workers as last year, but the player and child product operator says that he will give the current employees and season workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it was planning to set up 40,000 people in the country in the midnight of 2014. 45,000 employees were set up on Wednesday.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month will begin with application talks and increase the number of workers from October to December.

Michael J. Fox broke over his "date" with princess Diana
The premier of "Back to the Future" was probably a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also valuable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat is empty near me, and it's gonna make sure that princess Diana will sit near me," he said in a trailer for a previous documentary film "Back in Time".
The movie begins, and it comes to me that I am a simulated gift and a arms length from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the productive Steven gameberg.
"Back for the Future" had a premier for 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Playberg, "inconsistently the greatest time travel movie that has ever been rotated."
"Back in Time" will be viewed on VOD, DVD and in selected Chinese in October.
UN head says there is no military solution in
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Property is: "There is no military solution" of almost five years' conflict, and more weapons will only be worse for millions of people.
The UN Chairman again requests all parties, the United Nations Security Council, to join and integrate negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said to a press conference in the middle-week that he was planning to take the foreign minister of the five permanent members of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Greece and France - on the border of the Ministry of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in this month.
He stressed that the disruption in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional forces "to make this situation unresolvable".
Ban urged the five persistent members to show the same solidarity and unit they proved when they reached a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Question values showing that Donald Trump is to take seriously.
Some have tried to mark him as a Flop.
Others threw him out as a witch.
And some wait for a break.
However, as some of the Republicans tried to remove Donald Trump from the top rings in question, it has not worked (not yet).
Ten of the latest eleven national enquiries showed that Donald Trump leads in the two-party area, and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the opportunities of nomination of the Immobilious Module.
Of course it's too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts show that at this time Rick Perrys Führer was delivered to the growing Herman Cain, from which no one won only a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had been fighting in a general choice.
But foreign groups such as Jeb Bushs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps' maintenance powers and start to let their flocks flow to break it.
Here are some current investigation values that indicate that the immune module is not only a temporary phase:
Trumps have turned about 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in the middle of June, a question of Monmouth University showed that only two of the Republicans saw the Immobily Module positive.
By middle of July there were 40 Pro.
The beginning of August was 52 Pro.
Now six of 10 Republicers have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three of them say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week has found that 60 Pros of the Republicans have a view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP Selector GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67% of the Republicans said that they would either be "inquired" or "rejoice" if the Trump was nominated.
Just two of the 10 say they'd be "injured" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson is able to make the same funeral like Trump (43 Pro日 say that they would be "swimming" vs. 40 Pro©, who say the same about Trump).
Next in things of disgrace?
Marco Rubio with only 21 Pro.
On the other hand, 47 Pro · the Republican electors say that they would be "incomfortable" or "injured" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
Most of the Republicans do not see Trumps Temperament as a problem.
Monetary Donald Trump is criticized for his bombists and intelligent statements, 52 Pro > of the Irish electors to the Republicans believe that the Immobily Module has the right temperature for a president, such as ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-elect state of the nation, the Federal State of Iowa, where the same 52 Pro · the Republicans think that he has the personality for a super-commander, says Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 Pro日 thinks that he doesn't have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six of 10 independents say that his temperament doesn't pass into white house, so ABC/Post.
Republican electors are usually used to the idea.
When they set their teachers, the Republican electors hold the Trump for real.
If they are asked who wins the GOP nomination first, they say, after a question of CNN/ORC from the last week, four of the Trump is the best weight.
This is a change since the time when four of the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete translation: GOP electors had not in the past the clearest cristal bulk.
At that time, in the last cycle, four of the Republicians thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination for only 28% for the final candidates in the middle of Romeney.
However, it is shown that a number of GOP electors of Trumps campaign seems pleasable.
Even if the Republicans gather themselves to another candidate, Trump is still almost everyone.
Some experts indicate that the divided field probably contributes to Trumps Führe, while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a decade of other candidates diffus.
But a question of Monmouth University begin September shows that in a hypothetic head-and-head-head-train between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump has the majority of support.
He has 13 points forward before Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and s ́ before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-and-head-heading round with Ted ́z.
The only candidat that shoots him?
Ben Carson would overcome the undertaker with 19 points in a hypothetic head-and head-head rounds.
A small majority of Donald-Trump-Fans says they have made their opinion.
A new question of CBS/NYT on Thursday shows that only a little more than the help of the electors who submit Trump say they have forgiven their voices.
Of course, many can happen to change it, and no one can really say to never change the opinion.
46 Pro ́ said they left the door open to change to other candidates.
However, Trumps are the strongest competition at the moment of the other external side, the neurochirurg Ben Carson, but electors who say that they have made their opinion are so frequently for Trump.
Six of 10 republicians say they agree with Trump in the immigration subject.
Since Donald Trump in his election campaign two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "Vergewaltiger", the immigration of Dreh and Angel point was in the public talk in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombing expression of Trump will be removed from the Republican Party and protect the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post Question on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump in the issues of immigration.
So as long as the immigration remains in the ramp light, it will also appear to be done to Donald Trump.
The frustration over the Government is a new maximum level.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, in the middle of the support of the Republican electors, especially through their external state.
Six of the 10 Republicans say in the new Monday Question of ABC/Post, they prefer a political foreigner than someone with government performance.
And they're also whisper on Washington.
A question from Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa shows that three of the four Iowa Republicans were frustrated over the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 Pro > "incomplete" and 21 Pro > "heavened".
München, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residents of Germany
Here, in the Hobookenway, there is the most famous well-leaving place - with a shock over the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square meter of a reetdach house costs in the middle of $300.
"The boat of objects is naturally limited," it says in the § - so the high price.
A new range shows in which special position a square meter costs most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student offer in München are not really small.
In contrast to Germany's top hometowns, however, one of the prices comes like Peanuts.
The immobilious service officer Angels & Peoples has published a list of the most exclusive German resident standards - with square meter prices in sundry heights.
There are more than ten thousand euros - per square meters, noticed.
But that's good who can do it...
Overall: Mountains are not here exceptionally at the top.
Champions League: Bayern-Traum start thanks Mêber and gods
Duplicate Tors in Piräus: Bayern-Star Thomas Mämer has just a run.
A happy meeting of Thomas Mämer made the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then it went.
A sovereign record of the Champions-League season.
The World Master Thomas Mämer and Mario Godze protected the FC Bayern in the Hexenkessel of Piräus a dream start in the "Mission Mayland".
The community of Tra · Pep Guardiola wined its playing game in the Champions League at the Greek recordmaster Olympiakos in heavy atmosphere thanks to Mâers doppelpack (52./90.+2) and God’s treaffer (89.) deserves 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th starting success in Serie will be the first step finale in Italy on 28 May 2016, where Guardiola wants to finally take the pool to München.
Mümer received in 28. meetings in the Champions League to Bayern-Führer support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who allowed one of the World Master's shoes as a flatter.
"We will not subestimate them," said the Bayern Captain Philipp Lahm before the game in Karaiskakis station before 31,688 heavy fans - and the Münchners held the word.
They showed a concerted and engaged imagination without bleeding.
Piräus had wined his youngest six home games in the king's class, including against able clubs such as Manchester United, Atletico Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Burussia Dortmund also grew up (1:3).
However, the Bayerns, in seven Europeancup-dollars with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went courageously in their open efforts but often to work unexpectedly.
The attacks were too often started by playing facilities on the left side of Douglas Costa, who rarely passed against the former brainweight Omar Elabdellaoui.
Mâmer had more happiness from right than his flame from the right half field in the left top tower.
In the 67 minutes, the world master lost the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
Ton, when the Olympiakos starm Ideye Brown shot the Poland's headball from the line (26).
Then by direct receipt, the Torwart Roberto compared to the knee (35).
Although the Bayerns lived her dominant game on . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Tower Manuel Newer was left.
So about when he lifted a shot of idea over the late (56.)
Before Newer, Guardiola gave a fourth chain with David Alaba in the center near Jerome Boateng, which made it well.
Mario Godze, after muscle problems back in the frame, sat outside.
The WM-Held gave green light only after the final training, the sports officer Matthias Sammer said at "Sky": "Who wants to do something else, it is already bad."
Moreover, during the first change, Guardiola disappeared against him when Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59).
Gods came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made it clear to 13 minutes later, on the eleven meters he set up another.
Before the game, it came to the stadium to crawls.
After a smaller group of shared Bayern-Fans in their survey block, the guest-gist Piräus' attachments had been provoked with words and gestures, the security forces were attacked and went with a band against the Münchner attachers.
At least a Bayern-Fan was transported from the stadium.
Who fucking has a risk to lose teeth
He who smokes, does not only damage the long, but also the teeth - that makes a long-term study close.
The Message: In delay, the risk is quick.
The smokers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early.
This results from the long-term study of a international research, including several workers of the German Institute for Energy Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison with non-rounders, the risk was to lose their teeth for a pre-traditional period of 2,5 to 3,6 feet.
Over 23,300 participants were observed.
The main causes for dental waste are the carries and devorations of the dental meat, indicates the DIFE.
For this parodontitis, fucking is a risk factor, the authors beton.
Therefore, the connection between smoking and dental loss returns to more frequent dental infusions in fucking fuels.
It is not claimed where the rise of smoking is also increased in the risk of Karies.
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it can dure over → years until the flight is again at the level of non-runners, Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University Birmingham.
People must be convinced to become non-runners, the leader of Heiner Boeing explained by the DIFE: "Rounds reduce lifetime."
Do not smoke is good for longs and vessels and leads to a good teeth health to high age according to our knowledge.
In Germany, more than 20% of the population of 65 to 74 years are affected by dental insufficiency, the DIFE shared.
Previous studies had already indicated that smoke increased the risk of early dental waste.
The new long-term study underscores the funds.
Archaeologists met Kölner Rheinfers on the rest of the late antich
For repeated time, archaeological funds have been made at the right round in Köln.
At the nearby of the building site for the new Rheinboulevard, Archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum-Schelet and the rest of historical buildings, said Marcus Trier on Thursday.
Since the beginning of the building work at Rhein, historicals are searching for so-called landscapes.
At all buildings in the village of Köln, the Museum is always added as a fashion for Archaeological Boden Malk Manufacturers.
In the building section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents was already known that in the fourth century, a festival and in the eighth century a church had occurred three.
Besides the Festival and the Church Tourm, a Friedhof has also been discovered with approximately 350 graves, which would be part of the church.
Young Women of goods
After a young woman at the bathroom has been disfellowshipped in Geilen church linders, the Federal Police asks the people to help.
On the early middle morning at 1.40, the woman overflowed the glass from the direction of the Bahnhof building at the end of the train station and was found by a good boat coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
It was the most serious damage to the Federal Police.
It was notaryly treated and brought to a hospital by salvation forces.
For the reason of the nightly transmission of the young woman's glass, the employee has no knowledge.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or the residents have received acustic adoptions.
Question comes from residents or passengers from Linderner Bahn, woods, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Street (L364).
The indications of the cause of the accident may be given to the phone 0800/6888000 or any other police officers at the end of the hour and free hotline of the Federal Police.
The EU Commission proposes a new court against TTIP
In order to distort the fight against the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the Commission proposed a large reform of the current court system.
The constraint private clearing facilities for conflicts between concerns and States should therefore be solved by a more transparent system that is clearly more traditional in its functional manner.
"We want to set up a system that the citizens trust," stated the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the point of view.
Sweden proposes to introduce the proposal as a position of negotiation in the free trade conversation with the United States.
The German Government announced support.
Through TTIP, the world's largest free trade zone will occur with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current scheduled procedures are specifically expected that the EU and the United States will choose a common independent judge for a new investment court office.
They must be parts of the EU, the United States and third countries.
For the first time, it is also a second instance.
It would be allowed to raise appeal against judges.
By the time of the proceedings were agreed to judges, there was no opportunity to agree against their sentences.
In the debate of the past months, the citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in the matters of Fairness and Justice, commented malmstroom.
She wants to work on a International Investment Court, according to its own information.
There, for example, could be claimed conflicts between Chinese enterprises and EU States.
The procedures for investor State splitting (ISDS) are, in particular, one of the main foundations for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional courts are criticised by enemies as a kind of parallel light, enhanced tax payment undertakings, violated national laws or implemented a deterioration of consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact were too inadequate to the proposals of the EU Commission.
In particular, it was criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Economy Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) took the plans as a major progress.
The Commission takes into account essential points in the reform that the Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel has held in the early year with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private courts is from the table.
Furthermore, the French Government welcomed Malmström's plans.
The Business Europe's business association warned to prevent the economy's complaints through too many new rules.
It was said that small and medium-sized enterprises could be affected by this.
When the debate on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded, the middle-week remained unexpected.
The negotiations are running since the middle of 2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States.
The agreement should therefore be a framework for the end of this year.
This date shall apply as not longer.
Delicate people of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Each years ago, Sufjan Stevens is sitting on the top of the Kölner Prime Club (for now: Luxor).
Besides he is a Flip Chart, on which the Shooter's people's singers have put up the Malerian State Michigan with a filz-stift.
The whole public, approximately 40 people, is nearly taken by Stevens' proposal.
He tells us about various places that he always holds on the map, reports about his minucy and quite arranged songs.
Where they have come up and how it looks there, in his home.
After all, Stevens is shown as a wonderful creative error.
In 2003, the "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appears smartly composed Li ́, which can shame very close to the people of the latest six cities, but at any time in a great opulent way.
There is a statement that "Michigan" would be the first part of a moved series: each of the 50 United States of the United States should be followed.
However, since 2004 and in Rheinähe, "Seven Swans" has already occurred and has positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens is coming up here.
Live is enough for guitars and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to series.
The "Supjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise" appears in 2005 a covering work.
Overbording ideas and stylistic finesses.
The album grows in the `ananian Billboard Charts and does not miss any year-based list of influenced music media.
After overproductive experiments, Stevens then uses the "The Age of Adz" (2010) very comprehensive electronic movements.
This sixth ordinary album is still widely orchestrated, but played by programned sequences or beats and played with all effects and Hall.
Unless the smaller clubs come out, the bouncing shows here will be a bunch of speculators from Neon starbands and a great fluorescent bowning endeko.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens turns out as part of a five-cooping band through Germany.
Hamburger more in the dark!
Theater presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although now nearly 2000 guests are born here in their stones, the Stevens who are clearly refrigerated return to the intimity and to the people.
Without adjusting a word to the public, the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide enough album.
From the public, the proposal is "opulent" and you can thus remove the "places in the basis".
Only one added thanks to Stevens, accurately few older songs are played and declined under the sending applause.
Jeremy Corbyns Debout at the questiontime of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyns Debout is expected at the questiontime of the Prime Minister.
The new Labor president Jeremy Corbyn will give his debt at the question time of the Prime Minister and set up for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will be raised to put the first issues of his six questions shortly after midnight, whereas its use of the media is probably being examined and the Laboratory laboratory will be examined nearly.
He requested "weighty theater and more" in this weekly event.
He also said that he could overcome some meetings to leave the colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyns Führ. It will come after its name to the member of the shadow cabinet and after his talk on the TUC Year Agency on Thursday.
In the meantime, the decision of the chairman of the Labor, on Sunday during the time of the national hymne at a Memorial feast to the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence, has caused criticism from a number of Tory-MPs and is in the middle of several title pages stories in the magazines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymne has taken attention to itself.
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he would have "stood in respectful silence" and he recognized the "Herdentum of the Royal Air Force in the airbad for England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyns Scatten Cabinett, Owenitenith, reported in the BBC two Newsnight program, he made the Labor president to sing the national hymne, "independent" of the faith that the Monarchie should be removed.
Nearly a decade of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's Supplementality, and they call on differences in the economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Parties supported him as leaders.
The Political Correspondent of BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stopping" within the Labor, even after Mr. Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winning.
Mr. Corbyn said to the TUC conference that Labour would make changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
Hours later, Mr. Breakfast, the Shopping Work and Renting Minister, said that the party is "very clear" that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26,000 £ to 23,000 £.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labor president, David Cameron, since he is Tory-Cheef, in the last year on the dispatch box in Parliament.
The Laboratory president, who has spoken to another approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for Mr Cameron's questions and has been given to him more than 300,000 appointments.
The Islington North MP said that the question time of the Prime Minister is too controversial, and that it will be laid down both the "scaleness" and the fight against the opposite and has made it pleasure to cope with serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of the Economic Minister, will represent him, if he does not share - for example, when Mr Cameron is in the foreign country.
He also introduced the idea that other colleagues sometimes accept the word and that he invited John Bercow, the speaker of the underhouse, to examine the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the "Casperle Theater" style, which often was linked to the question time of the Prime Minister, but some years later he agreed that he had refused to do it.
Since she was first sent in television in 1990, the question time with the Prime Minister was considered as the main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leader in the sub-hus and its position under his colleagues, although critics argued that she had become a career and needed great reforms.
'Geschossen in Joburg': Unsupported youths trained to photographs
The town's area of Johannesburg is a kidney-hard place when you are obdeachless.
But a group of former road centres has found a way to learn a ability and to deserve life maintenance.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I've been shot in Joburg) is a pleasant man who teaches unfair young people how they take photos from their environment and get a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first members of the project.

Point increased by a decreased loan growth in the United Kingdom
The pound increased speedily to data showing a growth in the United Kingdom's salary growth, and parallelly FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller order target.
Among May and July, the result without Boni in the United Kingdom increased by 2,9% in the same year.
This progress rates were the fastest estimates since 2009 and were estimated on the date of an increase in rates.
The pound increased over 1 % against the $1.5505 and was estimated to $1.5505 and up to 0.84 % to EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index was increased by 1,49 % to 6.229,21.
SABMiller was the exciting action on the market and made a spray of 20 % after the transfer offer of the Rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest bridges of the world and bring marks such as Buddy, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry action was 0.9% of the concurrence concern for Luxury Richemont.
Richemont's latest sale payments were all expectations and also showed that the transformation in China - a key for Burberry - again growth.
Actions of Glencore increased by 5 % after the mountainbaurian said he had taken $2.5 billion by an asset retreat as part of his responsibility.
The actions of the Package and Paper Concern Mondi were the largest losers on the index, and with a decrease of 4,3 % after Goldman Sachs had set his assessment for the company's Rating on "over".
JD Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sport clothing undertaking for the half year had reported a 46.6 million pre-tax.
The leader of JD Sports says that the sales are the expansion.
The business leader of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a minimum loan for UK workers could mean "better purchasing power in the bills of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchase force will compare the workshops in his company, he says.
The costs could take the JD Sport expansion plans to add, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the main town: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappy 21 years old, a handshot with super-chick fresh.
The type with the plain blonde hair is 100 million euros hard.
Better even more.
Now Mr Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 walks through.
It's Viktoria Rudjinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of Fan's companion Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 hours tomorrow, however, the polyne is sitting on the cold stone plates of Berlin Luxushotel at the potsdamer place.
The Bieber Bow: Here you live, Idol, whose poster is at the top of Stettin since Montague.
The suit in which the Canadian song lives costs exactly the day as their mom Ewa deserves for half year.
It's all right.
She says, "My Wiktoria must actually sit in the ↓ class in Gymnasium."
"I'll get her a dream."
School obligation?
Who's doing it?
The fans aren't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He's got out of it without it.
For the advertising of the Superbo's public pause, he kassed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company, many, many on the bieber account.
And at every puppe that looks like him and over the Ladentic, the bieber also kasses.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're on the window box.
More than 100 million he'd have used so.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others show that Bieber is just in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Beeber himself, whose fourth album should follow in November, are not interested in many zeroes first.
At least he does so.
Pegida-Plakat brings Libanians to Cartof Field Idee
Cards or dawns?
It is both - and even in the Cartof Field Country, developed by the Oldenburg Imbis owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the language "Kartoffel place Döner" on a Placate of Pegida movement Alhay Cartoffel and meat together on a shot.
On the idea, a place was on a Pegida demonstration with the record "Cartoffels place Döners", which he had seen in a case in television.
Since then, a grill shot has been stuck with meat and cartoffles.
"This is a multiculti for the magic," Alhay says.
The idea has allowed the Libanian to be among the Patent Tax in Mountains.
There it has been used as a pattern, according to the information of the Authority.
How many meat and how many cards of the spit contain, Alhay will not deliver.
It's just so much: "It's smiling together better," he finds it.
In addition to his customers, the Kulinary Popular Conscience is well accepted.
Metcash starts a campaign for the control of Aldi incidence
Metcash tries to sämre the IGA branches before a Aldi-Aufmarch in Southern and Western.
Methcash has started a landing campaign to protect the marketing part of the IGA soldiers in South月a and Westerna in the area of $700 million Aldi invasion.
Currently Aldi prepared the exhibition of two transactions and the first 120 lands in Southern and Western and the beginning of the next year, strengthened Metcash and IGA supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and builded the IGA mark through stream marketing and dealing over the social media, as well as events such as Adelaide show.
IGA manufacturers and suppliers run on board, with marks such as Simmo eish manufacturer from Dunsborough, distributing tests in IGA-lands, and chargeholders, authorised tickets for Southern Footballly to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the major handler for food, alcohol and equipment carries its annual investors' strategy day.
It is a lot in the game, since Southa and Westerna is nearly 30% of Metcashs IGA loading businesses and generate win margins as Metcashs IGA network in the East States.
Buyers in Southa and Westerna are nottorially provincial and IGA soldiers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 Pro日 in Southern and 24 Pro′ in Western.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will remove sales in these two countries twelve months after its first markets are expired about five pro­proofs of food and all existing actors, but mainly individual operators will be sold.
According to a report published in this week, the Anal Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley assessed that IGA soldiers could lose 360 million dollars per year and Metcash 250 million dollars until the end of 2016.
This prognose is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will achieve a total of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the neighborhood and food business and in the amounts of metcashs high Fixenbase metcash could cost about 13 million dollars winning from rates and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash market shares in the East States, mainly in Aldi and Coles, despite a recent investigation of Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley recognises that Metcash's transmission in the Neighbourhood and Food Business will fall by 3.8 ProProperty in 2016, by 4.1 Pro© in 2017 and 2.1 Pro · in 2018, and will reduce the market share of 14 Pro · in 2015 to 10.3 Pro® to 2020.
Last week, the leader of the fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business seat in Melbourne that Metcash probably will disappear within a year. Metcash will be disappeared.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it will be done that a representative member of Metcash has contacted Mr Douglas last week.
IGA's marketing part has been seen since 2010 from 18% to 14%, and income from Metcashs Na Nah Trade and Food Trade, which provides approximately 200 IGA soldiers, has occurred at 43% since 2012, which reflects the operational debt in the simultaneous pressure on the combustion and margins.
However, the big handler turns and invests more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Coles and Wales in hundreds of products every week, and to improve IGA soldiers in the improvement of their feeds by rapidly growing fresh food and to provide a better choice of private-label lives.
Metcash's main business leader Ian Morrice says that price adjustments and loading programmes will be added to Elan and hopes that the major tradeer will return to a winning growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Connection Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more lob than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "Collateral Schadens" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kirgis and deserves, according to the president of the Australian tennis band Steve Healy, more lob than critical for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is always being used as "Special Ks", leads to the reasonable exhibition of Kyrgios with Stan Wawinkna at the Montreal Masters in the light of the ramp.
In a famous quality game in Ciõinnati, soon afterward, cockinakis and his enemy Ryan Harrison had to be driven two times by the trigger, and Harrison said, "Wawrika had to kill Cyrchios, and I should slay the child."
Since he was seen recently, how he struck a tennis shop, after a cramp defeated a potential US open-seek by Richard Gasquet, the cockinakis was permanently defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth about the second place in a single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup-Halbfinal against the United Kingdom.
"One thing I'm very exciting about is the fact that Thanasi, according to my opinion, has become a little in the fight," healy said.
He has broken a shooter when he lost a cramp in the US opens, but he is not the first player who has broken a shooter out of fruit with himself, and I know Thanasi enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, actually, he has been very good in the US opens, even under the extremely provocative circumstances with Harrison and so further, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around himself, and I think he was too strictly treated.
He's a very ridicule 19-year-old, he's very hard, and he's matching the team and so further, he has never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the environment, he's trained hard, he's well in the form, he's a very stable and excited young man, and I think he's deserving to be evaluated according to his own services.
Healy also supported the decision to not take account of the important decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right thing for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term firm component to the team."
"Not first we want the team to be completely competited and not to all the counterparts around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has quickly made up the growth of people like Federer and Murray. He grows in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad errors and deserves all the critics he gets, but we try to understood him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the light that he can only think about, I think it's appropriate, and it's the best for the manship and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary explains a disaster, closes the limit, holds refugees back
Hungary explains the need and delays the southern border with Serbia on Sunday and held all who tried to come into the country illegally, with the aim of stoping the adhesion of migrants.
Chaos followed the border, when hundreds of migrants were gathered in a country of nobody and Serbian staff reacted with emperor.
The people who were before violence declined were fixed for an unknown time in a country stream on the street between the two control points of the countries and builded circles and left down there.
But the Frustr increased.
When a police officer was over them, the migrants scandalized "Open the border" and cried out against the Hungarian Preparation Police.
Show some of the Protest food and water back.
Serbian Foreign Minister explained that it was "inacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
It must be placed in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Turbulences at the Hungarian-Serb border were not able to agree with a common immigration policy on the 28th Block at a close meeting in Brussels.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who seek refuge in overcome Italy and Greece, and they hope that the next month or until the end of the year would achieve an agreement that the EU States would take another 120,000 refugees, including some of Hungary.
The federal officer Angela Merkel and Austria requested on Sunday a special role of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not put his hopes on a quick action of brassel or his neighbors.
The emergency called on Sunday in two southern regions has given to the authorities more powers to control the crisis so that they could discover roads and reduce asylum procedures.
The Hungarian foreign minister Peter Ssiejarto said that his country also plans the building of a stacked round zone at its border to Romania to stop the migrants' atmosphere through the country - after it has ended a spring at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison sats were used in order to create the stachled race zone between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past months, Hungary has become a significant passport and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees in the Near East.
The President Viktor Orban, however, said that the majority of the approaching economic refugees are looking for a better life, and not for war refugees who have an attachment to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws which entered into force in the middle of Hungary make a crime to overcome the border or to prejudice the 4-metro (13 feet) high-pounds that the Government has made by the southern border to Serbia.
"On the situation that has occurred by the mass migration, the Hungarian Government explains the need," Zoltan Kovacs Governing Talk reporters in the South City Szeged said.
We say it very clearly: illegal transition is a crime.
The European Parliament must continue to agree with the use of the military, which is expected for the next week, but reporters of the Press have seen hardly armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for a long time.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said that the authorities were 45 people at trying to overcome the border, 15 others were already deeper invoked into the country.
They come through by protecting the boy, they are now in police care and are accused of the meeting of criminals in accordance with the new laws.
The authorities are in order to quickly repair the tissue.
Hungarian officers ended on Thursday Thursday two of the seven border transitions with Serbia, after a traveling car with a stackled race to close the borders.
Chaos was the most important cross-border crossing near Roschke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit people's data and a number of people to enter there.
About 20 came into, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important vehicle connection of Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse to get to Hungary until they could travel to Hungary.
Wahl-2016: Hillary Clintons Vorsp ́ before Bernie Sanders in national survey
The former US foreign minister Hillary Clinton continues to keep a double-speed prospect in the democracy rounds on the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her against the ground.
Clinton now supports 47 Pro > of the Democratic Electors in the Prevalences (58 Pro > earlier), while Sanders are on the second place, with 27 Pro© (increasing by 17 Pro.).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is candidate to the Chairman's office, is supported by 15 Pro-democracy electors.
More than five months before the beginning of the elections, most democratic electors say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will be subjected to them.
But Clinton's subtitlers are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News Question, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has achieved some wins.
Clinton holds a big care of women and moderates, but these reliefs have decreased.
Your support for men is clearly sought, and Sanders is here with only 5 points.
Clinton's benefit in democratic electors under 50 years has been disfellowshipped, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, has a great role in the elderly electors.
In the past month, Clinton was before Sanders with two-speaking advice at the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point-forpupp in this group.
Approximately the help of the democratic electors of the country's predecessors say that they would be understood by Clinton's appreciation if they were nominated by the Partie.
One fourth would underhold them with some preservations and more than 15% would only be subject to them because it is the candidate.
Six Pro's would not be understood.
Maybe not surprising that Clinton's current subtitles are especially disappointed by her.
The views are stronger mixed by those who do not understood Clinton - only about a fourth would be disappointed by it.
In currency of 48 Pro · the Democratic Electors of the Presidency say that they understood Clinton with disgrace, less republian electors say this about their Donald Trump (35 Pro).
When Clinton's subtitlers are asked in an open question why they want to be the candidate, it is the most common answer that she has the right experience (16 Pro©), followed by the opinion that it is time to be president (13 Pro日) and that she is the best candidate for the work (10 Pro).
From Clinton's subtitles, they are also associated with Bill Clinton (9 Pro).
It is also cited to agree with the problems and optionality.
Since the Vice-President has a potential for the President's office in the Waagscale, 57 Pro · the Democratic Electors of the Presidency want to see him in the run - a third person believes that he should not do it.
If the Democratic Electors of the Pre-Chapters are asked who would be their second election for the party, the offer is at the top.
Clinton's attackers say more than the help that offering their second choice would be far before sanders.
If Biden decides not to candidate for the nomination of democrates, Hillary Clinton's predecessor has increased before Sanders, from 20 points with bides on 30 points without it.
Fifty-five Pros of the Democratic Electors sees Clinton as candidate with the best opportunities to gain the choice, but this number of 78 Pro · has been seen in the last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement, but the prosecution that looks like the "electablest" is drawn up.
However, in the question of what is more important for a candidate, the Democratic Electors call questions on election.
Similarly, as in the last month, no one of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates for these electors of the prevalences is not acceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce results in some important characteristics in the electors of the prevalence of their party.
Most of them view Clinton, Sanders and Bides as honest and confidential and with strong guide qualities.
Biden is the best of the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Three Pro · the Democratic Electors don't believe that Clinton is honest and confidential, doublely say that about Sanders (15 Pro), but 27 Pro · they don't think of him.
Democratic electors of the prevalence generally see also Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideally in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, approximately a fourth of the democratic electors does not think of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server during the office as an external minister, most democratic electors are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions in general.
But it is another story in the public.
The help of the Americans is now uncomfortable with their clothes, while only a third is satisfied.
The public opinion of this was in the market, soon after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controllers had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 Pro± said that their opinion had yet been worse about her.
They are mostly republicians, more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the electors of her party, this is still a problem for them under assembled electors in total: only 32 Pro© they seem to be honest and trustworthy, eight per per cent less than the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 Pro of the electoral rights they do not think of a honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of the electoral countries also view Trump as not honest and uncertain.
However, Clinton and Trump receive notes in Führ.
From the six tested candidates, the best of the biden, Carson and Bush are cut off in honesty.
A majority of Sanders looks more than honestly, but like Carson, many don't think of him.
The failure rates for the trial of 351 democratic electors in the prevalence are 6 prospectpoints.
Ben Carson takes place at country-wide survey nearly behind Donald Trump on
Ben Carson is at the latest query of CBS News/New York Times close to Donald Trump
At the two candidates, the support of the electors in the new investigation is dramaticly lost.
Republican electors continued to Trump in a large number throughout the country. The support w23% in the last CBS request conducted before the Fox News debate last month was 27% in the Saturday survey.
But in the same period, Carson fell from 6 % to 23 %.
The investigation also concluded that Carson is well accompanied by the demographic groups and that the Trump is overcome by the Republican electors with high-school education.
The field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been rejected with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, while 10% of support in the last month to 2%.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida-senator Marco Rubio are 6% in the place.
The error margin in the trial of 376 people of Republican electors in this latest investigation is Plus or Minus 6 % and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC application that was published last week shows that Carson grows in the enquiries - it is 19% supported by the Republicans, 32% supporting the Trump.
The latest investigation of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a carson rising up in the last week, Trump found some pages for the former neurochirurges, even after Carson apologize to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on the last Sunday during a campaign in Iowa.
Accepting bathroom temperatures: The Mediterranean sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if spider values are only in the remote areas, there is enough for bathroom authors to get a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water.
A bathroom in North or East Sea must be a shorter enjoyment at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go to the sea anymore: Maximum 18 degrees have the water in the North and East Sea in this week, the German Weather Service (DWD).
However, bathroom temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: In the East, it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adria, there are 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.

Five members of the brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College-Neulings
Nearly two years after a student died during a schikanous ritual of a student's connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the morning is given against five persons.
Members of the New Yorker Bareuch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Brothership attacked Chun "Michael" in the course of a income ritual in September 2013 and repeated his transport to the hospital, which has been too dead, the police shared.
The employees said that he was charged with a 30-pound-ruck sack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a round field to a goal.
Mr. Deng claimed about head pain, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi Brothership did not call the call number 911 after Deng was unforced and expected at least a hour before they held him in a hospital, so the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothing, to go up his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng to the national president of the brotherhood to take advantage of the Council, the police officer Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"In this point the members began to hide outensiles and put the good news of the brotherhood basically on Michael Deng," said police officer Wagner.
He couldn't be resurrected, and he died next morning at his hurts.
Following an autopsy report, the deng was repeated with a fucking force of harmful damage on head, rubber and surroundings.
"Too many families have been disrupted by the brethrenship's shades. At least one student stir ́t at the schêen since 1970,” said Douglas Fierberg, a legal lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a claim.
Brotherships and their members must be responsible, and this step of authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a complaint for murder for the first five members.
Three and thirty members of the brotherhood, Mr Meng, are also accused of schikanous attacks and training of a criminal union.
"We want not only to make the shared persons responsible, but if there is a organization that has sanctioned - officially or inoffecally - this, we will also take them to account," Wagner said on a press conference on Thursday.
The Baruch College has prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brothership has rejected their belonging to the local group.
This will be performed when the feed increases the rates
A rental increase comes, and the houses will be able to be broken, the rental will grow, and the economy will go into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it will stop.
In addition, the story offers only small guidelines for the economic.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first increase of rate and was 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve is often in the summary of rates, even though not always, a person who responds to the economy and financial facilities.
Therefore, the US Central Bank's representatives have so intensely highlighted that investors should not be able to be able to acquire it when they start to increase the rates, but much more on the period required for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market shareholders could conclude that the total extent could be transferred because of a rate increase.
"The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as a sign for the end of the era of the "comprehensive money", said Julian Jessop, the Chefökonom of Capital Economics, in a customer communication.
In contrast, we are not expecting the general return of the US rates to normal heights, but still too low level to lead to the seismic shock that seems to be afraid of many.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effect.
This is a role based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen last month, prevention of price increases can make things voluntary for a while.
As soon as the growth occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There is apparently a tendence that assets are rejected 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in the monetary policy again," German bank analysers said in a newer range of what results in the increase of the feed.
In the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the surrounding strend - approximately 14 Pro日 - on the road to rate increase, quite flat in the 250 days after (medium winning of 2,6 pro), then return to the normal state after 500 days, with a average rental in the past six cycles of 14,4 per cycles as a present analysis that Bob Doll, the Bow Doll, Supplement Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron's Barron's.
The German Bank said that the impact on the actions would be trendly later in the growing cycle and that the pensions would begin to decrease.
Recesions are a fact of economic life, but cost increases often promote them.
In the present case, the fed is confronted with some conditions that have not been previously and which could clear a recession.
It is also noted that the Brutto-Inland product will be near its lowest point at an increase in the feed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 price increases since 1950 were only two times the nominal BIP under 4.5 Pro.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,6 Pro, only few expect that this will be awaited and expected for the quarter of the Atlanta Fed only 1,5 Pro.
Increasing price increases in such a fragile economic culies could be risky and reject the question: "If this time is different," said the German Bank.
Marketing participants have made themselves all the year to increase the price of the feed asst, and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week ending on Thursday.
As many strategy and economies believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the Futures Handle only provides a probability of 25%.
"In our course, all growing cycles from 1950 to today have been located in a super cycle with a higher weight at the BIP and made pre-recesion sheets very quickly after the beginning of the recovery in the shadow," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow repetition of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is at least the length that the fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is until 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatil, since the market has a price increase, and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital.
The main subsequence is that the effect in advantages is faster than when they change their strategic courses.
At the layout, the rendites seem to change the direction as soon as the first excretion/decrease in the cycle is achieved.
At the end of the increasing cycle, the leaders fall immediately, said the German Bank.
The strategy of Charles Schwab believe that the growth in the rates will lead to a closer combination of rendies between longer and shorter advantages and lead to a bleeding of the curve.
Higher versional facilities often bring better advantages in such a climate, although "We are still careful to expect advantages," Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analyst in Swab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already been adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the inflation expectations and the decrease of inflation, there are some signs that the market has been adapted to the view of more stronger money policy."
Short-term rates have been decreased, the rent curve is flash, credit rates have expanded and the volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the feed is increasing its area.
Increasingly and totally, companies who develop the largest part of their business in the United States will benefit from the increase in rates and the more attractive local products.
Multinational undertakings with high debt will be worse, since an increased rate increases their products on the global market and also the financing of their debt.
"The story shows that "Quality-" actions are concerned to respond three months after a starting rate increase," Goldman Sachs analystes said in a report for the customers.
Companies with strong bi-by-building companies have exceeded averagely 5 prospective points after each extent of 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Company with high capital rendites and low volatility in their actions also transfer their pens with low quality by average 4 (points) and 3 (points).
Debt will be a great problem.
Company with a high share of flexible rates will be lost most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure action games, consumers will also benefit from the growing process.
Sparers could see wins through advantages, even if experts are different opinions, how quick it will be.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Parliament member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of the Parliament criticized the sentence because of his "conformity"
He arguments that he is not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they just imitated the Brits
Parliament's college Damien Collins attacked the vote and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "Gos" to Classic FM, claims a leader of Parliament and increases new pressure on the sender to prove that he does something that the senders do not do.
The Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC boss that the public-local radio sender would be "verdume" and, at least, no longer distinguish from his commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't want the word "intelligence" - but it seems to be classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards that started in December last.
The BBC Music Awards that started in the past year seem to be the Brits only under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples that you're just imitating what is already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
The BBC Director-General pointed back the proposals and argumented that BBC Radio 3 is far before his commercial competitors when it's about life music and public advice.
What I learn from Radio 3 I'll learn about classic music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment for life music and musicians, which is really unovercoming.
"And finding a new music and giving new works in a job, I think it is really important," he said.
In the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argumented that the public should be more able to engage in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of the BBC production, which, during the consultation of the Committee for the Selection of Culture, Media and Sports, was to bring the commercial rivals to the feet.
The Tory Deputy Damien Collins attacked the Voice - the musical Talent show of the BBC, which was bought by the Netherlands Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall stated that the BBC 1-show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in special BBC-weise.
He wants the company to "search a hit from our household stall" when it starts a chat series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to provide money for the tax payers for other forms of interview.
Internet remotions increased in August at the latest and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven pro-increasing in online sales.
In the last month, the lowest result was since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales strengthened three years ago using phones to purchase
Experts believe that the Black Friday was born in November
For more than a year, the rational acquisition has been treated, and many of the main income strategy of the United Kingdom have become spiritually spiritual.
However, experts say that there are signs now that the online resources are stagnizing, after new numbers showed only seven Pro© in the first three months 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest growth in the growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five Pro > Increase in the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that stagnizing online sales after new numbers showed only seven Pro > growth in the first three months 2015
"If you look at the growth rats for the previous years and go back to 2000, it has always been developed during the time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales strengthened three years ago as buyers began to purchase their phone purchase.
It meaned that more people could be purchased online and that people could do this in different environments, for example home on the sofa.
But now it's increasing, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black-Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is quoted as a reason for the remaining ranges.
Experts believe that buyers keep their purchases before this event, each of them on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, the average number of buyers was cut five times around their computers to make their knifes, and some handlers' web sites disappeared.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers were fighting for the shops, could stop buyers to buy buying.
A position of the British Retail Consortium found that from 5 £ expenditure was published a little more than 1 £ online.
In some products such as television and wash machines, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out on web shops.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people bought clothing and shooting online instead of in the chairs in the interior places.
Muslims buried in Mekka during Kran accident killed - Bin Laden family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are made by muslims at the first enemies in Mekka through the streets
Saudi Arabia is part of the large Saudian Bin Laden Group to load
The Ministry of Health said that 394 people were also harmful after the Kran was lost
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together, when 29 of the victims were held through the streets to bury those killed as a crown in Mekkas the Great Mosquee.
Traury feed, widely clothed in white, the streets to deal with their respect, when the first of the dead arrived their last journey to the Al-Moaissem-F.
The tremendous process passed on the Holy Places, where only days before a bauchran crossed through the cover of the moschee and then snipped on the beds.
The bodies were released for the sepulchre, when the Saudi King over the building company of the family Bin Laden because of the disaster, which also left 394 losers, detained a sanction.
The bodies of 29 beds who were killed, when a crown crossed through the Great Central Mosquee Mekkas, were destroyed by the streets.
among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrim travel, when the crown was destroyed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the year Haddsch in the Great Moschee.
Saudi officials have already agreed that the Haddsch to Mekka will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin Laden Group would not have left the arm of the Krans when he wasn't used.
A Arabic version of the decree published by the State of Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the breakdown.
The English News Agency's service did not report this details, but said that the carrier of the company was prohibited for foreign travels.
In the beginning of this week, Salman promised to enthê, which caused the street of the crown, which cut into a inner hall of the Great Moschee, where hundreds of thousands of muslims were gathered before the Haddsch, which later located in this month.
The Binload Group has not issued any statements on the combustion of the Krans, and their representatives were not available for a opinion.
The Royal Decree also covered the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of crowns surround Mekkas Grand Moschee as part of the massive building hall leading by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to the dominant family of Saudi Arabia since years and has taken greater building projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a delicate son who was united by the family in the 1990s.
The disturbance of the crown came in the middle of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the Kingdom for the roads that are required at least once in the life of every healthy muslim.
The employees said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Governing representatives suggested that 1 million Rial ($174,000) should be devoted to the members of the murderers and the same amount of permanent damage.
Other losers receive the help of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of the east handworkers is over
British employee in the main worker, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe has increased behind
This leads to the opening of 200 other Screwfix woods that are targeted for handworkers
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B&Q sales will be closed in the country
From Rupert Ste, City Chef Correspondent der Daily Mail
It is claimed that British breast-feeding and pins for the use of qualitative ost-handle workers who perform the work in their home.
If you are sending with a hammer or a pensle to reach walls, you appear to be a minority today.
Because British workers are busy to carry out homeworks in their homes, so the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, a new business leader of King Fisher, who is the tree-ground category, said that a large increase in the number of qualified handworkers from East Europe, which offers services to deep prices, has been overcome.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops, which are directed to handworkers and to close 60 B&Q buyers.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to work more women in B & Q-Shops, because eight of the buy decisions are found by women.
At the moment, the men are overviewed by the workers.
She said it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends, showing more women's single maintenance, which make more renewal than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "It's still a majority of men in ours.
We need to move this more to an equivalent weight.
In principle, the assistance of our customers from women with 80% of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a great role in the decision process.
Mrs Laury, which is one of the only five women listed at the top of a British Index in FTSE100, has also restructured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in the field positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50% of the team with women, his business management and financial advice.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - in case this is an important subject.
It was not difficult to find women for our advice.
Kingfisher indicated a decline in half-year winning and the ranges after the group spent the costs for closing the feet.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B&Q日 will be opened 200 new.
Functionaries of Aich/Dob due to infidelity before court
In the Landsgericht Klagenfurt, two functionaries of the Austrian Volleyball Visionist Aich/Dob must have been responsible for unbelieving and tax interactions.
The complaints are not guilty.
One of them was also accused of misuse.
This proposal has been released in May.
The current process was discovered.
According to Ober-State lawyer Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, had been criticized that the complaints used for private purposes in 2006 to 2011 by the United States accounts on which they were able to be available in their functions.
He's insulting the damage with about 400,000 euros.
The sports functioners are also accused of financial proceedings.
This sum was separated by the president of the creation seat, judge Michaela Sanin.
It must be negotiated at a later time.
The defence of the unbelieving stated that the Union had not occurred at no time.
The sports officers would have only calculated advantages and the sport club for which they had been employed from 1982 to 2011 and had invested in much time and money - the passengers were employed in 2001 about 600,000 shilling (add 44.000 euros).
"Then we were before the situation: do we go on or lock the club?", said one of the complaints, in the Broadcast, in the Grand Business Auditor of the Finance.
With colleagues and complainants, he then decided to take this task.
With all the risks.
"We have proposed money to put our life insurance as a security at the bank," he said at the conclusion.
The agreement has been agreed: You can freely manage the money, it is only not to be made charges.
Furthermore, in the relevant financial success, the payment of adjudications has been re-effective until 1991.
Therefore, some of the contracts have been paid only years later, namely since 2003, as a plus has been on the account.
Therefore, pauschal and not detail bookings appeared to be made, and the former obstacles made the works.
The accounts and sparbooks managed the two complaints together, said the second complaint.
Why the payments were not detailed to the Union, the judge asked.
The United States has not been interested in the detail for the funding; it is important if only the freedom of debt was the answer.
In 2011, when a functional investigation was initiated in relation to Office misuse, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the United Account.
That would have been a refund, the complaints explained.
This value paper account went on the name of the second complaint and it was not said to the Union.
"Why?", The judge wanted to know.
The question was not answered for a long time.
Then he thought he believed that this was the best for the unit.
If he had done something, no one knew anything about this money, the State lawyer had put into the room.
The complaint has been informed, and the functionary has been justified.
This translation was formulated as "reproduction of damage".
Why damage?, judge and state lawyer wanted to know.
The first complaint explained that he had not been agreed with this formulation because the Union had never been a damage.
But what am I to do when the lawyer says, "They are all out of the cut."
"I am a judge?" asked he.
Moreover, the functionary said, he never had a cent hold, he has calculated only miles of money and diets.
In the diets, he has taken into account the United 1,000 euros per month, but the actual intervention has been very much, as it is.
Exact documents for the early years were not able to present the complaints.
They have not been kept anymore after a operational examination, where everything was considered correctly, explained.
It was also the second complaint.
All needs have been made in bar, and he has to go to the bank from residence of peoples to Bleiburg, explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will be continued on 23 September with the question of witnesses.

Time of decision on rates for the US Note Bank
The world observes when the US notes bank comes together at two days, mid-week and Thursday to take the important decision, whether the rates have been highlighted for the first time since nearly one year.
A question under 80 economys, which were asked by Re日s, found that a little more than the help that was the last week of the view that the fed would do this now thinks that the feed will be a longer time and the rates will be held at the current position of 0 - 0.25 per.
It's a historical event because it's seven years ago since the Fed rates set up on NU日.
"For the first time we draw close to a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalization of rates," said Angel Ubide, leader of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rose view of global conditions.

The decision shall be given at 20.00 p.m. MEZ on Thursday
Death in the Delta State's left a letter of excuses
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later killed and killed his colleagues on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it "leads" to him at the first murder and wants, "He can do it," gave the authorities on Thursday.
The police in Gěer, Mississippi, said that Lamb, Do日 for Geographic and Social Scientific Education at Delta State, calling the call number at 10:00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the employer of the emergency center that the police should send police to home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also realized that a "soul dog" is in the house, but "no one will slip," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb didn't give any clothes for his shoes.
When the police took the scene, they found the body of Amy Printiss, 41, and a manuscript note of Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to reject it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor for history, before he took his own life on Monday evening, as police officers had resigned him.
President of University William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but, of course, there was something in Mr. Lamb's view.
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb appeared to believe that printiss had a relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said on Sunday, there were "no information, no evidence" for a "driving relationship".
Printiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married about seven years as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but friends remained.
O'Steen said he and Printiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "at the ground".
He said that Printiss was their daughter "absolutely best friends".
Printiss 日e online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Printiss.
Knowles said that Printiss, who had a dog named Lightning, has met with Lamb for about three years.
"You always wanted to help others," Knowles said
The police said Lamb called neighbors at a certain time on Monday to say to them, "He's not going to prison."
When the police held him on the highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb moved his car to the side, fled to the foot, fell into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctor title in the early 2015 from the Delta State, such as his lifeshot on the University's website.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play a month for a double fraction
Luke Shaw has a double fraction of his right leg at the Champions-League download of Manchester at PSV Endhoven.
Since this is the left alien defendant to wine and will be excluded from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not expect Shaw to play again in this season.
The damage was caused by an unconscious attack of Hector Moreno in 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw was interrupted in the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes in the game field and needed sugar before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone-infraction and lies in the hospital."
He's been sent tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very hard and then plays fantastic, and then happens.
In the cabine of the surrounding cabine, he had a mask of sugar.
He wept.
I'm not Ar, but if you have a double fraction, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to be a red card and the decline of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge of the divorce, has not punished the Mexico.
Van Gaal believed that the Italian court had wronged.
You can evaluate for yourself if I say a elf meter and a red card were random.
It was a very bad attack with two feet.
"I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how I'm, my way to heal now, I'm going back stronger."
On this occasion: Manchester United leads to the loss of Luke Shaw at the download of the PSV
With the European Mastership in France, the British Defensor has a regular incentive to recover until June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad damage."
If a player with this kind of damage leaves the place, all are very troubled about it.
It is never the purpose of our players to destroy an enemy.
Moreno takes a bone break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland manship at WM 2014.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to destroy the enemy, and if you hear that it's a very bad hurt, it's not good," said Cocu.
For me, it wasn't possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard that can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés storedo was also brought to the hospital - after a fool game of Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It is a thing that all parents learn quickly: If your child lies a book, it will not dure long until you almost know it outside.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was requested by a supplier of childcare systems to call his favorite child book, the President of the Lorax, the environmental office of Dr. Seuss, was dismissed by the Minister for the Lorax.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Free, move, creative, and with a powerful message, it is a book that I want to read my children, because it seems always to give a picture or message that we have lost until now."
All nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in the Cameron, describes the operation of the book, renew the contents of the film version of 2012 to add the new characters and details to extend the very short original text.
"In the murdered city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted hopes that the heart of Audrey wins the girl of his dreams by he wants to see a real tree," reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose right name was Theodor Seus's Geisel and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that would not be adequate enough: the text presented by Cameron is partly reading as the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of the Internet Film Database, and thus begins: "In the murdered city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he may be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron has so little confidence in the operation of the book. Here is a unnamed boy, such as the local environment falling through the money, trees, Thneed striking once-ler, despite the protest of the named Lorax, a hot-breaked, "which speaks in the name of the trees," is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR assignment was delegated to a helper that the Lorax did not have 20 times behind a child.
A Downing street speaker said the text was probably coming from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron workers was delivered, but there were no more direct comments.
Adam Lyth was obviously threatened by the exclusion of England's community, but it is still hard.
To join Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, it is a difficult task, but when you have chosen the frame for the Tour of England, a repeat of the 3-0 test series download is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an external.
Alastair Cooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are spine players in the Batting, and the Community spirit is strong; they will not be narrows from 2012, just a young-eventive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown size at the test level, it is a option for the attack.
By Message: Adam Lyth is separated from the English Test Cader and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, to me as his leader in Yorkshire, to analyze hardly.
In his seven tests, there were two attacks under weak conditions, and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are aligned on results.
There was no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, there - and I said this before - players are their best electors.
A long time ago, Lyth's run was prolonged, but he had the control over his own shock room.
If he hopefully split out more flows for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English Trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not have so much powers, and that doesn't surprise me; he is especially a teamman.
The question of how much time a test scheduler gets to put his character is difficult.
Lyth received seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton received the opportunity to play home and outside.
The only prejudice that you can highlight was that England first placed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a slagman I appreciate.
He's a X-factor crycket player, which we saw early at Yorkshire in this season, when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bri's place, which really met us.
He needs at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this depends, of course, of the social creation in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen shoot near Cook what brings a extra-spin-bowler and gets four quicks, and I don't have anything against it.
I don't see why a slagman can't shoot there, and this left handman has already shown that he's a devil of Cricket player.
Moeen may not have accomplished his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no large subsequence.
My former team college Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first hole before he arrived in 2001 as opener.
He created three hundred years immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as back-up spinner, and in my limited relationship with him he has very impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - average 31 with the switcher and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spheres that lift their hands up and the tree has decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
On the other hand, England has made a few wise additions in the tree stab.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a counselor for the test games could be a mastercoup.
He is one of the most beautiful guys of the game that will bring a five of experiences because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white cow of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as player or as coach, and how Mahela has the idea that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the cabine, even if the news are in accordance with the previous.
Colly Team College at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One Dayers, Root has received a similar pause against ­ and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and Team Makers do not determine the time plan.
And you must remember that as the players depend their jobs from the results.
Such decisions will not be made easy in the heart.
The Brexit Layer (Brexit = Great Britain exit from the EU) could win when the economy is in a flat until 2017
David Cameron's unexpected new negotiations strategy to maintain the United Kingdom in the EU will be deeper in difficulties every day, even without the choice of the genial Jeremy "Is it or not?" Corbyn to the leader of Labor or the TUC, which is quite devastated by Europe on Sunday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A recent diplomatic friend said that some Member States, so deeply disturbed in different crisiss as the EU is now and not always from their own fault, the British agenda themselves has been created with splitting events and contracting changes that most of them do not want.
In Brighton the TUC disappeared at its annual assembly that it doesn't like it if they have social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance claim at gipfel meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of themselves before a famous local memory, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win for reforms.
It's always about me.
My beloved friend, who wants to look forward to the United Kingdom inside the EU cell - "Let us not alone with France," says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short-sight ministers and officers have arrived in some major cities to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's carefully designed officer Angela Merkel is a associate, but she has been at power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it seems bad for her as has occurred in the longer endurance such as Thatcher (11 years), the middlerand (14) and cold (16).
Frances François Holland looks at his recovery or replacement in 2017.
He's also a disgusting power.
Poland may have soon a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is hard to imagine that they will be thrown up a bone to help the Selfia bridges whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland outside the UK - something they do not want because most of the similar separatist trends.
Thus, some of these ministers may even plan not helpful comments in the SNP style, while British Reference Campaign 2017 to clear the Brexit process, my friend believes.
"The new negotiation was a pleit" and "Brittanny has won nothing from valuation from the new negotiation."
The Europeans know how crucial the Fleet Street can be on their costs and what EU skeptics is the Oligarchie of the Pressebarone, how they were not supported by Tony Benn in 1975 with a proportion of 2:1.
You can weakly remind Boris Johnson, the Erz-Europe Opportunist, who has made a name as a "EU-Rate-Banene" Brussel Correspondent in the early 90s.
At all his foolishness, Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies.
This was the Medley of tax-guarding shocks, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-lands, which are most of our large magazines.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but she concluded that when you sit with a warm Gorilla in a coffee, you would better distribute bananas to deal with him instead of becoming tomorrow and dinner.
In fact, the Miliband was more blairianer than Blair himself when he opposed the Cameron Reference Equipment, because Blair had put the principle on the EU's unnecessary Constitution, which was then rejected by French and the Netherlands electors in 2005, which opened him a door.
The press has never dismissed him.
But the good Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly shot on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to forget for me anymore - seems to repeat Neil Kinnock's Boykott Murdoch in the 80s, a mistake at that time and today.
It can endure, but he needs to develop a coherent area to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns of the European position is - I'm trying to express it friendly - in the development.
He says we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside the Ukips traditional brushing tendence and the wilderness of Torys Klein-Englishism can say it everyone.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" feet in the radio and television said this week when the pathfinder struck in him, not to admit that Corbyn's name of the provocative John McDon's as shadow cancer was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father was trying to be unclean to his Laboratory colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was still more attractive.
But to fight to stay "in all circumstances" - Ben's expression - wasn't what McDon said, or what JC told his fellow members and deputy, after all reports on their class meeting on Montagued.
Whatever the famous Bottom-Up image of Corbyn wants to provide - remember that he even has touched me - News-Disselflin remains important in TV age around the hour, and in front of all things in the Strudle of Social Media, a breakfast of Paranoia and Verbal.
It is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to maintain Labors support in the reference campaign for self-intelligence, as McDon said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDon's and Corbyn's basic majority of the EU's nationality - in accordance with their Bennite Employment Economy, their anti-capitalistic past - is not a question of the exoteric debate among left dissidents, for which the Nazism of the small subsection is a central principle of dogmatic conflicts.
Like with his multilaterality to Nato - Tom Watson, it is convinced that JC doesn't start out campaign - foreign diplomats will be committed to try to find a sense for their representatives at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin disappear political capital - they also have misstrauic electors - to make access to the British, if all this can be uncertain?
The United States are already extremely disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and inside, even with a cost-degradation of the Tory Government at the power, which I was notified of something that was called British Influence Security Forum at the beginning of Monday.
Experts criticize Report of Public Health England on E-Cigarets
A Stately financed agency that E cigarettes are less damaged than smoke from a meeting of 12 persons, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "base report" last month and described it as a "complete check of evidence".
However, some researchers have asked the data's loadability and shown the connections between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
A guideline in the Medical Journal Lancet adopted the "excellently wine basis" on which the PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the packs are "building on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor for European Public Health at the London High School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor for Clinical Epidemiology at the Property of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is to be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that PHE's claim that "the current best damage is that e-cigarettes are less damage than smoke" based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who have been invited to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) decision analysis (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to bring their views on the damage of various products containing Nikotine to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were included in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a meeting sponsor was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose business leader had before received from British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent hold.
He also signed the BAT references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from a e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the financing that he had to receive from the previous reports from the Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the Gremi are not delivered, but it belongs to several e-cigarette champions, some of which some also specify a branch funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this session are not for their Know-how in the tab control.
At the meeting also participated in the management of the PHE.
The research work of the group "determinedly" is that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in the most criteria", says McKeee and Capewell.
However, no such connections or restrictions will be discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's reliefs that "not yet proved that e-cigarettes served as a way to fum for children or non-summers".
Prof. Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ had already been reacted before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are mostly less damage than smoke."
Each second lifetime fucking fucking smoker is at his search.
All evidence draws close to that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison with it, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence is given and what is not, especially if there are so many public confusions about the relative holdings in comparison with the tabak.
Nearly 800,000 people die each year in a disease relating to smoking, and the national health system costs two billion £ per year.
By the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a part of the damage caused by smoking, we comply with our national responsibility.
BBC should specify EastEnders, says earlier Chief of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give your right arm" for Hit-shows such as Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the taxes should be used only to make the type of programmes not sent by other UK senders.
He criticized the BBC in order to place public-local programmes, which probably are seen by a smaller public, in a hard-conflicted window against the most popular shows of their rivals and by senders like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to contact BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC provides or sends programmes that would also be clearly shown by non-subventionated rivals," Johnson said to the Superhus Communication Committee in the framework of his research on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the taxes which I don't think for a mean- or long-term idea, at least it should be produced on programmes that do not do or give others in order.
You send The Voice into a first classic time window because they want to get a largest support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this, it's a bitch, it's funny, it's naturally unconscious.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax programme is financed which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, given by both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand to it.
I'm trying to see how this public-local television should be.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an undertaking for series, leading the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC's guilty for assessment is "for the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular sentences of the BBC reveal what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, inside MacTaggart's proposal in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows like EastEnders should be overcome.
Johnson said that the public-righteous Nine programs should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the public, but they're able to meet their tasks, and they can argument if they go to their apparent missions to legalize 4 billion £2 £, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They're putting them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
Johnson said to the Committee: "I invite you to find an easier regressive system regarding conditions who can get the best value out of this.
Of course, you all think, we all think you get a big value here for 150 £ per year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £, ask me if it is true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also stated before the Committee on Thursday, requested the BBC to check their Reithian mission, "inform, build and interview".
He said that only a little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that there was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and she should take an example to the public-local television senders and Canada to change this in "inform, disclosure and interview".
About partnerships Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms of which he said that only a handful is shown in television, and coming with the commercial senders of Allians to make everything available online.
'Sonovátics' can control brain numbers by shadow
The video shows how the non-tooths change the direction at the moment when they are handled with sound impulses.
Agencies have cut worms with geneticly modified nervous systems that can be caused by shallwells.
The winner's nemotors change the direction at the moment when they are drawn with sound impulses that have too high frequency for the human listener to be heard.
The impulses work by enabled Motoneuron cells that are geneticly modified to make the membrane channels reacting to Ultrashall walls.
More about this subject: Read and write Hirna with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Sonentiatics, which can be used at the Ultrashall to enable a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardane that the procedure of one day could replace the deep-in-stymulation, an invasive procedure that causes electric impulse to humans to treat the symptoms of Parkinson disease.
Fedenwurms usually do not respond to Ultrashall, but Chalasani determined that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air flashes.
The blass, he found out, strengthen the Ultrashall walls that then enter into the worms.
The strengthened Ultrashall walls are affected by structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm rings.
The shallwells affect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned, such as a report of Nature Communications.
In order to create Ultraschall-controlled non-made, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of their motoneurone TRP-4 ion channels.
If he applies Ultrashall to the changed creatures, the shields will be strengthened by the microblocks and in the worms above, where they enable the changed motoneurons.
The procedure has made some similarities with opthaltics, a bowling tool that allows the guardian to enable neurons with impulses of the light.
But Chalasani said that Son >tics could have some advantages to this technology.
In contrast to the light that is required to be sent down at a optical phaser to the desired place in the brain, low frequency ultrashall wheels can be uncontinued and can so be sent to the brain from above on the coat.
"We believe that with genetherapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the human neurons assigned to the Ultrashall signal temporarily accidentally in a clinical position for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications may be able to produce muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, if it adds.

The shows promote British weapons trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen-Video.
Terrible murder drones!
Fucking footstock inflammation!
Stroomben!
And electroscock sticks that cause crafting pain, but don't leave track!
The joyful voice and the Cartoon images do not doubt that this statement for the world's largest weapons is a military parodia produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the British Government's ready to the campaign light, to destroy weapons of repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many places that are to be seen at bus holdings and in the U-Bahn moves and require a second row.
"Special announcement: Are you running with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) are read in the fonts of London underground and the DLR line marks that walk to the image of a panzer.
In September, a warmth of weapons with the DLR will be driven... customers will be asked to help when stoping the weapons.
The 300 places are of artists who have published their work in the Museum for Great Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A colleative named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute in London, using "Ad Space Hack ́ks", a 6 £ inbus key package, which claims that "Access to a third of the bus holding areas on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this Placater "Vandalismus".
One of the parodia indicators produced by the Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, the Kurator of the Designs and Do actors in the area of Essex, artists will be critical and will try to bring political work to the public outside of galeries.
Artists are active within protest movements to work and note that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on the society.

The Amnesty video was viewed more than 1000,000 times in 24 hours over Facebook, and the VCCP public agency, which is beneficial with the graphic and Voiceover artist, which is also free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was surprised on the silence that ruled around the publication for the weapons - through a empty place of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign to avoid them."
They played with the finding of a more realistic double business, but "including with light colours and animations it remains stronger."
"You have done a fantastic job by helping us to cover the knowledge of the sale of illegal folter devices on the middle," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we now need is an entry of the British Government and the guarantee that folter devices are not being treated illegally before our home door.
Maybe the most creative art around the weapons mixture comes from the area within ExCeL, where the manufacturers are fantasticly euphemist products.

Eight golden rules for life in students' homes
11 years ago, I went as self-forgotten 19 years old to a student's home, still in the faith in Berets and Moral Relativeism, but just now I am reminded of the intimidated lamps of those I threatened - and of the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be destilled in eight simple rules.
The income in students' homes is quite easy nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It's disgusting to wear: people tell where you come, whether and where you took the Sabbath Year, where you stand about Corbyn and why you "really said Marmite don't love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a hepheextract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Respire.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It links the speech and helps you find people you like, in contrast to those with whom you wouldn't talk, even if your winters were burning in fire and these fire solvers.
Let people go.
The rooms of people are often converted into tree-receptions, film-night events and communal meeting points, but they are also the places where people are attached and pressed their subweights.
Before this: Do not remember starting at the Uni with a relationship
Introverted receives a serious treatment at the university.
Your room should be a requirement, but many students have a room-to-space bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life-long friendship.
That can be the haee for someone who tries to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave to get back the energy I have used for the interaction with you."
Try to see when a committee has been created - and send him a SMS place to cross.
Approximately: Do it.
A guy in my student's homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship through backs.
Since you start the University at the height of the back-meny, it is the clopping at the doors of people to imagine you with a toller full of brownies, less rare than the welcome of the 1950's "Welcome in the neighborhood, I have made you something back. So, and now, please laugh if I ask you some personal questions."
A good way to close friendships is to offer householded leckers.
Your inhabitants feel obligated to interview and may finally be associated with a beautiful surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a responsible baker.
Sleep mixed clothes of meal, sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you attempt.
To steal food is an offensive crime in students' homes.
Of course, the clouing of cow is a deep steel, but is it to take a thief milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk tube.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it's terrible, and you have my compassion - but try to do more equivalently than my contemporary resident, who takes her milk to punish the debt.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a warm that keeps people from sleep or from work.
It's not just to be a responsible man, but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass in the real sense of the speech.
A girl on my flur asked her neighbors whether there's something to make them a Drum & Bass something easier, because there's three hours tomorrow, and she had a test on the morning.
They reacted to this with a lot of music.
When she stopped at 5 hours, she left her neighbors sleeping friendly two hours before she left her own music, closed her door and came to her three-time test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wedding would enter into the same student's home?
It wouldn't be extremely penalty if you hold a cohabitant for your future wedding, relax with them, turn away and then see them every day, and maybe survive, how they overcome all the common friends?
Of course, the heart goes to his own ways - but if a warm companion is definitively not your future wedding, at least try to introduce your sublime a little understanding.
At the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in ≥ unlocked room, the limit between a Ulk and Mobbing fe, as it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it's just a moment until he gets to bumerang.
By hiding a valuable and amazing lesson on security - but never disappoint any room with thenpasta and Shampoo.
Close your door, and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the fresh-shirt - but you don't touch your possessions on the cover more than twice.
Room houses for refugees, All treated, Low servers
The immobile company Markus Gildner builds in the medium-friendly eckental order houses for people who do not have much money.
So about for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need residence, but also the only learning mother and the low-servant."
"I'm going to show how you can build more favorable and well today," says the 44-year-old interview
Thousands of refugees will get to the apartment.
Markus Gildner believes how quickly a living room can be created: he builds in a project order houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will get to the apartment.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive delivery in containers or tournhallen has no sustainability.
Because the people remain in a large part here.
In view of the refugee stream, we also need enough residence in the next year.
A completely banal, three-shooted order house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house is at least place.
It easiers integration.
It's different if you're putting people in places.
Each of the six houses that are just built in the pilot project consist of three residence units for four asylum applicants each.
Each apartment has two sleep rooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a stay room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I'll go back.
Then the homes can be easily converted to the relevant needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square metres residence per house is 184 000 euros, without base.
That's overviewable.
Six months the building has endured.
That's right.
Has the building rules complicated their plans?
Gildner: I've made my project correctly.
Be 's complicated makes it always the suspicious damoclean rate of special building and the station regulation.
Great.
It is still undertaken who gets three apartments in a series house, but at least three places.
Only in the towns there is no place for it.
And refugees and asyl applicants have no cars.
How did the inhabitants respond to their regular home project?
Gildner: There were some who preferred me to create luxe buildings for asyl applicants.
That's definitely wrong.
But don't you distort the competitive fight for payable apartments?
Gildner: True, we have had a building in Germany in the last five years, but have been built luxual apartments, which can not be able to offer a more.
My project has the message, as well as the normal people need residence.
Not only refugees, but also the only parent or the low server.
I show how you can build well and well today.
That's why.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and worked with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operation system when Apple Updates are published
The new operating system can be requested by going to settings, typing "General" and then select "Software Updates".
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have been killed after installing problems because it has received an error message that indicates that the "software updates failed".
To cope with the problem, users are recommended to wait until the storm returns or trys to update over iTunes.
The phone itself drives you through the process.
This may mean the deletion of applications to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by refusing updating. It will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to remove applications and then install them again as the process is completed.
It is rewarded to ensure that your mobile phone has been uploaded during the update or is close to a load device so that the battery is loaded.
If the loading is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone may be disabled in half ways and this could lead to a break of the update.

Rosbergs only Devise: Full Attacke
Nico Rosberg knows the WM Title in the form 1 against his clear Mercedes team colleagues Lewis Hamilton only a devise: "Volle Attacke".
The WM two pointed to the decided seven oversee rounds before the start, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 Points separate the Vize World Master before the night in Singapore on this Sunday from Title Protectors and Hamilton double-champion.
The British has already won seven of the twelve seasons until now and also takes the flight-light-green price in the city as a favorite attack.
2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British could win the running.
Whether the current gog in the city will affect the large price of Singapore, it is still unexpected.
Since days, a dark cloud depends on the city, exhausted by fires on the neighborhood island Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The shock club "Chachfriend Bad Kissingen" found three months ago has included another member in his order, so the number of members increased on 19 players.
The new member is the undertaker Paul Gauselmann, a passionate shack and tennis player, who remained more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the leader of the Federal Service Class 1 and the citizens of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbeck.
The shock club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a spending with the president Alfred Klein.
This is possible to take up shack players who can't bring the members' contribution.
Young work and talent search should also be provided.
Gauselmann wants the membership in the shack club and also a friendly contact with the Tennis Club "Rot-Whit" as a expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
Quarter office looks for direct contacts
Saludis and the Old Antonistics have opened a new station on the graph-stouffenberg site.
In addition to advice, you can also participate in courses.
The social institution goes down from the mountain to the inner town.
Exactly said to the Graph Stauffenberg Plaz.
There was recently opened a new quarter office.
Here, directly beside the purchase, receive from the start of older and advising information on questions such as insurance or benefits of hospitals and guards.
Since years, we have concluded that our ambulant supervisory service often has been abandoned by the members of the country.
There are infinitely many questions.
"And not rarely many services of the cassen will not be taken into charge because the complexity of the insurance will be not yet understanded," said the new householder Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for antonist and civil capital and for the ambulant service "Amadeus".
Besides the consultations, the new quarters office also offers prevention, health care and wellness.
This is what the Saludis was taken into the ship.
So you can use associated offers such as prevention, memory instruction or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the older space and the Saludis are added to the ideal way.
Saludis is for prevention, precaution and Reha.
"The old space for maintaining and watching," sheeke Riedel, business leader of Saludis.
The reason for the development of the new quarter office in the town is that both business leaders are particularly in the demographic change.
Because this makes a decentral infrastructure in each city part of Bamberg in the future.
Moreover, as the citizen Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the meetings, the quarter office also describes the age agreement: "There are many events and offers on the program and they are income to a regular joint conference."
This is a great contribution to the social establishment that elderly can live in their confidence and confidence.
The quarter office is open Monday, midweek and Friday from 9 to 14 hours, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 hours and Sundays from 10 to 12 hours.

The meeting of the FC Intracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bayer football Totopokals against the third guests FC Würzburger Kickers has now been completed.
Played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19th hour in Bamberger Fuchspark station.
"We are glad that we know now when the game goes over the bowne, now we have planning security," so FCE team manager Karlheinz room, which also refers to the currently started map recycling.
It is especially for our community to play against a thirdlist.
So we hope for a number of viewers, and this is not without reason, because flying light games have a special trip.
In the latest 16 men, the FC Intight Bamberg 2010 entered the victory of the circuit ligist 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and the house against the regional luminators 1. FC Schwenfurt 05 (3:2).

Wiener Architect Karl Mang 92-year-old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of the Wiener Architecture, is dead.
He already died on 5 September in age of 92 years, as the artist's house reported on Thursday.
With many, the artist's house loses a member of honor and "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the sending.
1922 was born in Vienna, many studied during and after the Second World War Architecture at the Technical High School in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he was a freedom of architect, but he was also a teacher, writer, and institutional leader.
From 1972 to 1983, he was president of the Austrian Institute for Formation.
In the 80s, he was assigned with the establishment of the stock rooms in Wiener Hofburg and the construction of the Palais Lobkowitz to the Austrian theater museum.
Parkstrafe: Tim Wiese is involved by the police with money
Ex-Fußballer Tim Wiese has been injured in Bremen.
Footballer was once, in the middle of the time, Tim Wiese, ex national tourists in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have made its own statement in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he did not allow.
Wiese just cut his hair in the Bremer town when he saw a park-room guardian outside a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
How did it get out of the business, the employee encountered it and cast her the random money penalty before the feet, as reported by the "image" quotation.
In the town of Bremen, the prejudices are made, but the consequences of the unusual case are not yet clear.
"The thing is still in the test," it says from the city Bremen.
First then will be decided whether show is displayed or not.

Women test on 17-year-old afghanistan in
Witness seeks a case in Bad Soden-Salmuster: On Friday, on 23 hours, three young men were on the road from Bad Soden.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghanistan, followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters, and invited them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was located at the height of the bft station.
Three persons were also held in the area of the dance site.
One of these men now cried to the young people and shot this with the fashion into his face.
The victim takes a nose-break and bleeds strongly from the nose.
When his two friends joined and joined the guardian, he left too of victims.
From his friends, the hurt young man was now brought home.
The teater followed the group with a pkw to their apartment and passed there most times.
When you didn't see the vehicle anymore, the loser went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the murderer and another man.
Under the adoption of a shock stone, the face and the surface of the victim was spread.
The damaged had to be brought into a hospital.
There is only a good description of the teeth.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters large.

Dr. Frank Mämer takes the practice of households and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Mezzaer-Gongoll and Frank Mämer (from the left) take the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehuses.
This is also a pleasure for general citizens Bernd Bormann, the economic assistant Uta Seim-Swartz and Asendorf's citizens Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, however, doctors - Asendorf have happiness: Dr. Frank Mämer takes the practice of the homes of the halls on 1 October.
Current Ursel Fallehouse goes to the rest, her husband Karl-Heinrich holds followers in the next months with a half place to the side.
After a construction phase, Mâmer opens the practice on 12 October until he invests 310000 euros in the spaces at the St. Marcellus Street 6.
It was a sympathy on the first cup when Frank Mâer and his wife, Dr. Silvia Mezzaer-Gongoll, who are currently able to deal with their education in the world hospital and want to enter the practice in the next year.
"We've always had in the head that the Mâmers would fit well in this practice," Dr. Ursel says and laughed.
"If it was so much, I just called her."
The couple Mâer holds the idea to carry out its own practice in Asendorf.
"The nearby and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Mâmer.
"We want to meet the families over the years."
As a benefit he also sees to be his own head soon.
And so it was agreed that the mothers bought the house with practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-vilsen.
There is also the two-fold family father Frank Mâer, followed by the medical study in Hannover in several Ar’s practices, as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently employed as Ober · in Sulingen, and he was also assigned to the leading notesrc in the circuit Depholz, and is honestly involved in the DK-Breachhausen Vilsen.
Since September 19, the practice is prepared for the new leader.
Since the Chirurg Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felste Houses as housear 日 ́, his Gattin Ursel (Internistin) has specialized the gastroenterology.
The Masters, both interists, want to leave as householders.
"The endoscopy comes out of here," says the 38-year Silvia Mämer-Gongoll.
After the construction, the rooms will look modern.
We will offer more Ultrashall research and long-term and charge-ECGs and we need more speaking rooms.
The EDV is completely renewed.
A total contribution of EUR 50000 is received by the Mezzarers within a programme of support from the country circle (25000 euros) and by the Samaritan (12500 euros) and the community (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happiness we are that the practice will be continued," states General Deputy Minister Bernd Bormann.
Approximately 2000 patients, Silvia Mâmer-Gongoll says every quarter in the Praxis of Flight Houses, in the Northern average practice, are about 500.
There is another houser practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practical transmission by Frank Mämer: The Apotheke remains awake as a result of the origin of rockhouse in Asendorf.
If no follower had found it, she would have gone too.
Instead, who visits Mezzares speaking hours continues to look, especially in trusted faces: takes the seven medical facilities and the cleaning force of the stones.
With their abschied ends a era in Asendorf, the medicals have always practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," the Ursel mentioned ashamedly.
It's a little weakening that's a long time after it.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and many patients will be sure too often," says the Internist.
Your husband added: "We have a 6000 square meters base."
"Bisher I've always had before the garden work, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two boys and wants to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
"Now the border controls will also be taken to our southern border," said Internal Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to it.
It is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylantrage can also "the same understanding".
The provision and security of humans are in front.
But, of course, "that it makes clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept free migration streams, nor over the Austrian-Slovenian border.
There was a controlled procedure.
Croatia refused Corridor Slovenia
The Croatian Government had previously informed, also Slovenia wanted to continue to travel to Austria and Germany and to create corridors for the refugees.
However, this is not the case of the Internal Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of Corridors is "absolutely inacceptable", Slovenia will more intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.
Croatia's border is already strongly controlled as the external border of Schengenrra.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenin will not disrupt its limits for refugees.
"Each EU member must comply with his obligations, elsewhere the system can't work," stressed Gyorkoes Znidar.
As the Croatian Government notified, the first refugees would have already requested on Thursdays to enter Tovarnik/Sid in East Croatia at the border crossing to eliminate registration.
The Croatian police could take her into the nearby meat fields.
According to local media, the Croatian tourists have continued to enter police vehicles with new refugees.
It is primarily about Syria and Afghanistan, including many women and children.
Also salvation services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country counts with approximately 4000 refugees, said Internal Minister Ranko Os日ic.
Moreover, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had already brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would enlarge Croatia's direction, reported Croatian and Serbian media in the middle-week.
However, the Government in ́rada concluded that it was to indicate people to put certain roots: "We can not, we don't want to do this," he said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with approximately 50 refugees in the Serbian border city Sid would be expected for further buses during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The insects were all night from the Macedonian border that was about 500 km away through Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has arrived, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could now actually come to a little further westly-western part of the movement of the Balkan Route Turkey-Greece-Mazedonian-Serbian Hungary, which is already promised by observers.
Croatia: "Increasing possibilities for border control"
Croatian Internal Minister Osiaeic had previously highlighted that his country had prepared for the case of a strong emergency plan of refugees for a possible exceptional situation.
He did not mention the details, but he indicated that Croatia as non-schagen members had "increasing possibilities for border control".
Strengthening controls are carried out in order to qualify for the membership in Schengen area.
Slovenia belongs to this since 2007, the EU partners have made the country a witness from the way, with regard to the standard of border controls.
On Serbian side, there are about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border zone.
The media reports have been transmitted last night at the border crossing of Horgos, leading to Röszke.
According to the information of the Hungarian authorities, the two borders of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked.
If the rest of the refugees now want to travel to Croatian border, it is still unexpected.
The Serbian internal minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to make middlewomen at a local appearance in Horgos: he held the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be currently a very high refugee number.
You can't even say if they would continue their travel over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Aids rated migrants to -average - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee assistants have already started to distribute land maps to the refugees in which alternate rounds are included by Croatia.
However, the transition between Serbia and Croatia is not inappropriate: in parts of the border area there are 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, still still no mining fields.
Middle Week, the Croatian police said that a team of mining rooms was sent into the border region.
Bursen-Hacker: Ukrainians save 30 million
Supranonok has heard of a ring of cyber criminals, which has been expected to have continued to have been reported in unpublic financial reports and press communications on sites such as Business Wee, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information provided is to be made on the financial markets.
In this way, over 100 million of people were increased by the mediator.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will be captured," says the SEC communication.
The processes against 32 other accusations were in the case.
Most of the complaints come from Ukraine and Georgia.
In the United States and in the East Europe, the tattoos must have acted.
Ecumenic Hospital Aid Manheim is already 20 years old
About the Mannheimer Paradeplatz is a government operation.
People make their cares, partly quick steps, partially disturbing.
They control the two Sts of the Mannheimer Autosalons at the Paradise.
Keep the town's rounds.
Pulsing, bullish life in a glorious herbs sunlight and with four large tables each with the heading "Before I want to die."...
The ecumenic hospital aid made this action note on its 20-year-old existence and seems to be confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we've gone with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josephine Lammer.
The leader of the Ecoumanic Hospital Aid is also available to the passengers for questions and talks as well as the honourable employees.
Some of us, a spontaneous passenger gets to the cross and the seat to "become my life", "read", "keep walking through the American camper", "Stop the war" or "not long suffering", keep others standing short, reading, saying seats like "when I'm still" and then go on.
There are still small discussions on the border of the action, on life, on the relationship with the dead.
Peter Hübinger is just in the place.
"Only if I make sure that the end of this world comes to me once, I can live responsibility," says the director of the Diaconic Work Mannheim, which is together with the Caritas band of the Ecumenian Hospital Aid.
Therefore, this public-effective action is good for 20 years.
That everyone does not want to communicate to the tables, but be understandable, it is a very personal thing.
The theme Death and Death is arrested as before with Tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although just the hospital movement has been very closed to the opening of people in the past years.
A appreciation that Angelika shares Godfroid.
The death and suicide member belongs to the honourable employees of the first hour.
By personal experience confronted with the thee, she read many literature and dismissed to want to engage in the mortal assistance.
When the ecumenian hospital assistance was searched by calling for the public, it was immediately reported and had been in the establishment in 1995.
Godfroid belongs to a team of 45 honourable - 43 women and two men - the occupied and responsibility in private homes, hospitals, officers and hospitals in Sankt Vincent.
All of them are carefully trained.
Angelika Godfroid can well handle their task and experiences and experiences.
"I see life from another waiting, keep it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant economy hospital service is free and independent.
The financial support of hospitals and S.A. of members and Uniteds allows training as well as training and supervisions of the members of death and death.
All two years are offered training for new collaborators.
The tables described on Saturday are now published in the house of the Gospel Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
More personal desires can also be noted on post cards.
FedEx mixed result, finance looks for 2016
FedEx reports disturbing results for the last quarter, and the supplier gigant delayed its view of winning for a year due to the weakest request for travel services and costs in the field transport service.
The company also said that she plants about 55,000 season workers for the vacation.
At that time, FedEx announced that the company wanted to set 50,000 season workers for the time of vacation.
The action falls over 2.5 Pro日 in Premarket hand 45 minutes before the midweek exhaust.
FedEx Corp. said to deserve a winning between $10,40 and $10,90 in the business year, which ends in May next, 20 cent less than in the previous preliminary.
Analysts were expected as a question of FactSet $10.84.
The lower appearance comes despite price increases, which will be averagely 4,9 Pro > and will be effective on 4 January, and despite the proposals for land transport of hard and big packages that will be raised from November.
The company said that, however, it was expected that the result of the previous year would be increased by the expenditure, the income and the growth in the online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred ́t said that the company "produces solid income if you take into consideration the weakest economic conditions than expected, especially in purchasing and global trade."
The vacancy employment plans were announced a day later than the UPS Rival, which plants 90,000 to 95.000 working forces, approximately the same number as the last year.
In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx deserved $692 million, 6 Pro > more than the previous year.
The result per action was 2,42 dollars per action, nearly after $2,44 per action, which asked an analysis of Zacks Investment Research.
The conversion increased by $5,3 billion to $12,3 billion.
Six of Zacks asked an analysis expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has decreased a decline in the international priority sentence in the last years, which has implemented the Express sending to stagnize in his unit.
But the tree on the online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the transmission in the land transport was increased by 29%, but the operational result was in fact flat because of the costs of larger packages and self-security.
The Express unit was made of income on the basis of prices, while the result of work in the travel business was decreased.
In Premarket Handle, about a hour before opening, the FedEx action is about $3,85, or $2,5 Pro¤, to $ 150,15.
On Tuesday, they ended with 11 Pro pro loss for the year and 17 Pro > under a record on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, the Federal Reserve Strategy takes two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni-board to decide whether it is time to take the leadership for the first time since almost a year.
A wall picture of the United States is over them at the end of the two-coordinate meeting room.
The map is a reminder that the Fed President Janet L. Yellen and its colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a double task from the Congress: Maximization of the US employment and prices are stabil here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unscriptural mandate: financial stability.
And this mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too strong to predict it. It is given on Thursday if the US business is ready by the unexemplary incentive by the short-term rates that are close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data of the economy show that they are solid, the youngest turbulences in the global financial markets might be threatened to enhance this volatility by enhancing the rate of allocation - and if it is only a fourth point of progress.
"The work and the inflation in the first line will be the most important they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, leader economies at the Maklerfirma Stefel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think when they were looking for a plan to not increase the rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is sufficient justice to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consciousness of what the Fed will be done, which disappoints the financial holding himself.
Approximately the help of the economys which have been asked recently by Bloomberg have predicted an increase in rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect an extent of the feed, with a key indicator that only shows a 30% opportunity to increase.
This requires a decline of the action, if the Fed increases the settlement, unless the strategy is mixed by it promises that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, Dow Jones Industrial average of 228,89 points or 1,4% at 16.599,85.
The action was issued by expectations that the Fed Policy holds the set in this week, said John Lonski, Chefökonom of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would take the seat at this time," he said.
If she does it, "they should go very far in their clothes to fix the financial markets so that they may not be panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in rate would reduce the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty of where the feed would be done.
Another month ago, the feed seemed to increase the set of 0.25 percent points in this month, the first small step in a slow deterioration of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the early and early years that, despite the complaints of Liberals, it would need more economic progress to expect an increase in the settlement.
Although the creation of workplaces was delayed in August, the improvement on work was solid in this year.
The rate of unemployment was 5,1 % in the last month, the lower than seven years and near the level that the Fed views as full-employment.
Loan increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although the inflation continued under the annual objective of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices.
The economy "speak rates and wear it because of the effort to work," said Ian Shepherdson, Chefökonom at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the finance markets in the whole world were broken together in the last months after China had evaluated his wage.
The average value of Dow Jones Industrial was more than 16 % under its maximum level in May, as investors warned that a renewal of the Chinese economy would distort the global growth.
The market has recovered something in this month, where the Dow is now nearly 10% under the height of May.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulences affect the complex calculation in order to increase the rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would take the shoes at this meeting," said Stephen D.O., Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and an ancient worker of the US Note Bank.
He now states that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the capture.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the effects of the US economy, and there are almost no confidential data that describe the developments in China," said Ol.
The health of the world economy is no of the main areas of the Fed, therefore it should not be involved technically in its decision.
But in the end, the Fed Wheeper has become the world's members.
The impact of the Central Bank was great in the last years.
The only reference of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed can "decline" its monetary expansion, solve confusions around the globus.
In a world where markets and people's economy are extremely disrupted, the Fed representatives can be expected that they monitor not only the developments in other places but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding for the global economy.
Its decision finding is "better art than property", said Zachary Karabell, leader of the global Property for the Envestnet Inc power management.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a story of overreactions on financial movements which appear to not have been linked to the economic based data."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is employed for an increase of rate, cited decisions in 1998/1999.
A financial crisis in Asia was the Fed to reduce its guidelines by 0.75 percent points at three sessions "increasingly recognizable effects on growth in the United States", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives rejected these shortcomings.
The Fed should place the aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market agreement of 2008, said Adam S. Posen, an earlier member of the Bank of England.
The youngest turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"It certainly doesn't want to go into the situation in which she has before a rate increase, because the markets are on the ground," said the President of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the duplicate mandate and does not affect the financial stability, and until it is changed, I don't think it should prevent the time.

Hoyerswerda: Small life assistance for refugees
More refugees come to Germany in these days.
To prepare you a warm welcome, it doesn't go without the commitment of an unnumberable honorable assistant.
Moreover, in Hoyerswerda, there are a number of people who are unusual asylum applicants in the city.
They belong to Petra and Klaus Heine.

Brazil’s pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes Ernä ́ for healthy silences
The Brazilian phydiatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly explain women about how important it is for food during the resttime. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babys that sucks to breasts that are advised to present unsafe foods.
Mother milk consists of a number of proteins, feet, vitamins and carbonhydrates that give the babys all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
As a result of the additional energy requests, pregnancy and young mothers will be made to increase their daily calories for about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results indicate that a calories import is not the only dietical adjustment that the mothers should take.
A current position under the leading of Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy enemy of pregnant women actually concerns the gene of their babys and slips it before tumor development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy food of the child can affect the immune system negatively.
Exceptions for the new Bernère sportshalls
The Community Indrat Bern¤ approved the building rate for the 2,3 million euros to the sportshalls.
And he made an exception.
The dach can be flashed for solar layout.
The planning for the long-designed tournail building at Bern's sportsians is a step forward: In the latest Community meeting, the exhausted building rate has been completely blessed without great discussions.
Earlier, the committee had made another request for a constructive "exception" respectively "free" from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was the authorisation for a special form in relation to the construction of the dach.
Thereafter, it is to be created a "Sattach with non-middle Prime and Dach County".
The background of the planning is the intended use of the area of solar arrangements: "These makes us together a great South Dach," said citizen Joseph Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "free" was once again about the depth that would be provided for for energy reasons - other than in the building plan - under a degree.
The volume of the Hall is clearly reduced.
It was therefore necessary to "free" because the building plan regarding the decline does not allow "exceptions" - whereby the Bern's community is usually more restrictive for freedom applications.
However, the tournhallen building is not a new project: "We do not create any case of presidency", as Steigenberger.
The tournhallen building in the sport area is a Community project of the community and the SV Bern.
The costs are calculated about 2,3 million euros.
The promotion of school and width sports is expected.
In the next step, the building rate for the 18 x 36 metres is now present to the Landscape to test.
Clinic Petzenberg goes to Schongau
The hospital Petzenberg is to be closed before planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will be a new director at the hospital Schongau.
The station and the majority of the employees are running from Petzenberg with to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of the Hospital House of the country circle, which the Landruin Andrea Jochner-Whit was occupied.
However, a decision is taken by the Supervisory Board, which takes the next midweek, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the 50 employees in the hospital in Petzenberg would continue to work.
The majority of fishermen and the remaining internal station should run to Schongau.
The spaces are available.
The workers who are not able to go to Schongau must be offered a workplace in Weilheim, such as white jochner.
The workers are informed of the plans.
Ausgel ́ has the exchange of Dr. Andreas Eder's announcement, which is first since the beginning of the year, the director of the Schongauer Clinics, and now changes to a practice in direct near the hospital.
When the question was to reach the follow, Jochner white came, the name "Fisher" in the game that was ready to take the lead from 1 October and change with the team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a "valuation" and a spread of the boat in the field "Inner Medicine", such a jochner-white.
Fisher is a specialist for heart steppers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized at the internal station on gastroenterological diseases.
For the next two years, fishermen with team should, if the Watchtower Council agrees, lead both homes until the next year the former hospital of the craft, which is still more than 35 beds, will be closed in Petzenberg after almost 140 years.
The country circle had planned this for 2018 when the current sanction in the hospital Weilheim has been completed.
Landrutin Jochner-White, also president of the Supervisory Council, was found in the case of the house which is in the possession of the Bundesblock, which would be able to be used as a residence for asylum weapons.
"I've finished this." As it continues with the immobility, Jochner white couldn't say that there were several reviews.
Currently, a short-term officer of Caritas and a daily psychiatries are subject.
"What better couldn't make us, a likely opportunity will not come again," so fisher over the Quasi-smoking to the body that was "employed and very comprehensive" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house where fisher has been more than 30 years as Chefar 日, has not given it.
He was requested by Schongauer colleagues to take the posts of your Director's responsibility.
The hospital Petzenberg (only 100 beds) was always threatened by closing in the past years, officials were closed, for example the chirurgical and birth assistance.
The handballs of the Rhein-Neckar Leeuws are requested today (20.15 hours) at the mountainous HC.

A facter has led the police to the body of the 16 years missing from Rheinland-Pfalz since Saturday.
In the audience, the 20-year-old one told the killing of young people and throwing their body in a channel in rock houses.

Refugees need subcommunications: a warning before lucky apartment
The situation in the German apartment is attained.
Even more refugees are looking for a payable stay.
The pressure on the apartment w.
The social apartment building is a challenge.
The divisional fights on the German apartment have started long.
With the coming refugees and workers from the EU, more people are still driving on a market that has already been overloaded in many major cities.
They competite with income weak citizens about the last payable apartments.
To cover the request for payable apartments, new units should be built up until 2020.
This is the result of a mandate of the "Social Apartment Building Association".
For comparison, this year, 20,000 units are completed in Germany.
That was about 140,000 apartments.
Refugees have no longer been committed to live in a first receipt company after the first three months of their stay.
Then they stood on the apartment and entered into the long snow before the rooms.
However, the Statistical Federal Authority said that in the last year, less than the help of all asylum applicants.
However, the negative development of the apartment is not only the increased numbers of refugees.
It also constitutes significant deficiencies in the building policy of the last years.
Germany has a apartment department, which will be increased from year to year.
Currently there were some 770,000 residents in the Balance areas, accused Matthias Günther, author of the ↑e.
Therefore, professionals lived in large towns in WG rooms.
Young wake up because of the flaute on the apartment Family Woods remained unfriendly longer in "Hotel Mamma".
In the large towns, the number of square metres per head was first spent in the past years.
To solve the problem, the "Social Apartment Building" covenant proposes a restart.
In this context, new incentives are to rebuild the social housing building.
This could be deteriorated on the basic acquisition tax, and the basic tax for promoted apartments could be expired.
In addition, the attractive tax collection options are needed.
The promotion programme for refugees from the State Bank KfW is now well on cities and communities.
One week after the start was received with 184 million euros in Montagine on the half of about 300 million euros available.
Now the project could even be thrown up.
Refugees have free course: Croatia and Slovenia are invoking Corridor
After Hungary, it is practically no longer overcome, because more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to provide travel over Slovenia to north without shopping.
However, it is dangerous.
Croatia wants to understand with the neighborland Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Internal Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a korridor," said the Croatian Internal Minister Ranko Os日ic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen country yet.
After the delay of the Serbian-Hungary border, hundreds of refugees have been canceled to Croatia to reach the West Europe from there.
500 people have reached the Tovarnik border, reports the Croatian TV RTL.
Hungary had cut off his border for refugees in the morning.
The new laws that entered into force on the same day are also practically superfluous in Hungary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees operate.
The Croatian President Zoran Milanovic explained, "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and get something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighborland Croatia on the morning.
The majority of the media reports followed, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both with the bus and with taxes to the Serbian border city Sid.
Soon after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia over the Green Limit.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, however, the refugees were not at the border zone.
This is why the border streams are other: there are still low mines from the Yugoslavia civil war in the 1990s.
Miner rooms will now make a safe passport quickly.
To Hungary, there are no more refugees after the border is closed.
On Tuesday, the police numbered 366 attacked people.
Shortly before the morning on Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws constitute the overcome and damage of the limitation as a penalty.
In the Southern border city Szeged, 35 criminal procedures were therefore initiated.
The convicted sentences dropped up to five years and the department from the country.
According to the imigration participants, the new "transsessions" in total, 94 asylum applications have been received on Sunday, with almost all - 93 - the most important transition of Röszke.
Thirty families with small children and two elderly people were among the applicants.
On midweek, 40 refugees would have stopped there.
However, in practice, no one has a view to gain asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian view, Serbia is a "secure third country".
The refused asyl applicants should be cut down therein.
Before the "Transession" in Röszke, just a few hundred refugees were gathered together.
In Rushke, workers started to clean with it.
They collected the MÃ©, who left the ten thousand people in the last weeks on the road edge.
Blocks were drawn out and one of the recording camps was rebuild in the border.
For the purpose of this construction, no one wanted to express himself.
Austria is only a few refugees in Serbia and Hungary after the closure of the limits.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 200,000 migrants remained in the country according to government data.
In Salzburg, approximately 1400 people were waiting for further transport to Germany.
The movement from there to Germany was taken to the German authorities on the morning.
In freelassing, smaller groups of refugees have regularly entered into foot.
Citizen Master passed over the border
"We were employed after the breakfast on Sunday with the cleaning, as suddenly people with travel sacrifices at the entrance of the cell," thus warnstein's citizen Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted the move to Passau.
Since Germany had surprised the traffic with Austria on Sunday, but because of the flight stream, the traveling driving with Austria was for them in Wernstein Schluss," thus the Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the strands together with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the Near Passau.
Previously, we have made the unexpected guests first with jause and drinks.
We just said we'd bring them to Passau with the car.
"This was self-intelligent for us," so the citizens in the OONE talk.
They were very thankful.
A man didn't let it take a great spending - 100 euros for the firewall.
"It's been very pleasant to us," so the Stadler.
On Sunday, the passengers had passed by a ICE in a regional direction Passau on Sunday, so that it had been announced that the travel traffic was established to Germany, but to try over the border.
However, the regional road was released before the frontier in Wernstein.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The Brücken festival related to the Bayer neighbors on Sunday, before a two-breaker cycle in sport - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from New Church.
The Viktor Orbán now sends more cig thousands to us is a logical result of a seeming:
Instead of helping in the Lager Röszke immediately in creating structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Conceller has highhofed the standing of the Hungarian Government in the dark circle of the national socialism.
Sadly, these are not only those Austrian who are now confronted in the border areas with chaotic states.
In addition, the refugees will have to find out that the "good country", which she invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee campaign.
It will be a great challenge to make human conditions for protectors in the light of the persistent refugee streams and the nearby winter.
And it will be an even greater -- to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Conrad looking for 35.000 winter-fighted quarters
Conrad has all the hands to make full with the running.
Christian Konrad is usual that his word has weight.
The Government has used the former powerful raiffeisen banker to build quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first collection of Traiskichen has already received Konrad.
"We have no more obdachless in traiskichens," he reported of the first success.
Also the submission of the 200,000 refugees coming to Austria on Monday has been made without a big wire, Conrad said and praised the organizational "Master Service".
The Internal Ministry has spoken of a "crisistic situation".
In total, Conrad calculates a need of 85.000 quarters in this year.
To comply with the number, 35,000 visits must be found in the next week - 20,000 countries will provide 15,000 of the Bund.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a fashion without ground," said the Conrad.
He has already spoken with the heads of the country.
They would have allowed him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's good in the Upper Rich," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Kardinal Christoph Schönborn, which will be made clear how the church will help.
Great expectations are also placed in the ORF "Help like us".
On the platform, persons may offer uncomplicated visits.
Moreover, you hope for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Conrad and Mayer criticized the standards for submission last night as "very high".
In need times it cannot be that quarter providers must keep a certain height of the handholder or size of the lights above.
"Not standards" should be applied for a time limited.
In contrast to the Internal Ministry of Transfers, Conrad is based on his experience.
I am an elder Lord, who is not in any other way speaking the uncertainty.
The power of conviction is his most important weapons.
Conrad and Mayer do not cause the Republic to cause costs, as they themselves explained.
Their number of workers want to increase them to three to four.
The own quarter search was not yet.
Conrad wanted to build a container at Stephans' place as a office.
However, there are evidence problems with the authorisation.
Linz requires a better distribution
First, no opening of urban sports and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the delivery of refugees build the city Linz.
This is currently not necessary, since you can take those who are concerned without these measures, Mr Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations should be examined in their property.
Critical is the leader of the city in the division of refugees within the Federal Country.
Moreover, other areas have to contribute here.
Seehofer: "The Greens are not cut off"
In a longer phone with the Bairr President Horst Seehofer (CSU) the next action in the refugee question was agreed on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not disrupted.
The continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there is now the corresponding border controls.
Specifically with refugees to Germany, there will be no more.
However, protectors would be brought to Germany with regular movements.
From the other EU Member States, pirates asked for further solidarity in the refugee question.
Now that Austria brings back controls to its borders, it is "a logical consequence" for the Pyrers from the Germans' actions.
The next tasktastic is a question of time
The general announcement of the "New Werft" in the Linzer Industrie is officially completed.
In four of the six stocks of the Office and production building, the base-notated IT-concerns S&T has to be removed to young, innovative companies from the technology area.
"In the IT the wise heads are our rubber - and we need to try to work for us," says S&T-Cheef Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in startup companies of the New Warp and later accommodation.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - what the Nederhausers promises, "The next tasktastic is just a question of time."
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Tech center, which belongs to a third of the city Linz, the country of Upperërreich and the Bund (FFG).
The building is forgotten by the Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 Pro ́ of the 2700 square metres area in the building are already missed, for more 40 Pro ́s requests.
Lia-Peroni-Inhaberin opened the second business in the arcade
In the new shop, Furla hands are in the middle.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to make a dog.
The 49-year inhaber of Lia Peroni had to move in the baptism arcade shortly: Sō has now grown up in another business site.
In the Furla Shop against the business in which it is packed, coffee, shoe and wheat of different producers, it is now all about ladies' hands of the Mark Furla, money bills are 75 euros.
A larger toys and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop is in operation.
Earlier, several weeks have been rebuilt.
"But I've long overlooked if I should open another load," says Width.
Exceptive for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla Products, which are in Bologna home, were also made by the idea of a own location where only their hands were replaced.
"We're the only ones in the Grand Room Linz who survive this mark," says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots.
Her interest has been put width from her mother in the wheel.
I'm increasing when something is developed and I can show new trends to be admissible.
Why some women do so in the view of a nice handboat in destruction, also the actor can't answer with the last security.
Perhaps it's that a beautiful box evaluates every outfit.
The Callstadt's bruisesmaker
The Phallers of Donald Trump's predecessors came from a place whose residents are called a resident.
This property also connects to the billion who wants to be the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for upholders.
Whether he expresses an alien, the journalists strikes or reveals happiness in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the US President's office forces the election fight.
And snippet well with it.
This is also registered in the Palestinian Call City, where the majors of the Immobiliarmi are assembled.
The New Yorker with the feed fresh is a meaning of many in the Winzerdorf on the wine road.
Some in the 1200's place of residence has been associated with him over - tithes.
His grandfather came from call city in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the choice mode.
The callman Simone Wendel rotated a movie over Trump.
And what do the villages think about his goal to become the most powerful man of the world?
"I think they find it somewhat stressing, but they are not so deeply impressed in their call city kind," says Simone Wendel.
The famous chain officer has rotated an amazing documentary film over the place and its famous speakers, to whom the Kelikeup Heinz family is also counted near the Trump.
Trump, which is not for modesty, comes to "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) as a word - so that he would be safe if he would live in Call city.
He didn't bring it to the king of the hearts.
If it gives respect before the benefit of the family, but also tendencyly the opinion that Trump "son a little big mul" is, Wendel says.
Apparently, the name of the Spitz, the call city in the surrounding area, is "The Brullishmaker" - to the Hochdeutsch: the more, she says.
So Trump comes out of the village of the ever.
The Trump's success story began 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a local for gold grapes into the United States.
Basestein of the Immobiliary Concern was the first basic sales in New York.
But the life of older men was not free of tragedy: Your desire to return to the home was divided by the Bayer State that the pfalz belonged at that time.
He did not record Trump because he had only been rejected without authorization, the director of the Institute for the Palestinian History and Popular Schunde, Roland Paul, had explained to the start of the film.
Trump is the only one of a "illegal emigrant".
This is in contrast with the marking statements of the follow-up.
He had recently spoken about mexican immigrants in the United States and requested the building of a border wall to disturb illegal immigrants.
"It's not so sympathic as the polter," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote companion Trumps ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winner in the rest sees the Americans more distant, "He's always so exciting."
Does he think Trump is coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about the call city."
The Pensionswirtin Veronica Schramm is aware of some call citys that a family of Heinz’s descendants sent something to the church orchards, which generally came well.
"I can't imagine that of Donald," says the 68-year-old.
They found it better if he doesn't win the choice, because "He has such radical views, I don't know if it's good."
If those who had the saying in the days of his grandfather in the United States were like him, "If he never arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than he," says the Winner daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as the president?
"My President isn't it," she says.
And: "The trumpets will also be reef without the President Trump."
Wendels film, interviewed for the Trump long, have seen 12 000 cinemates, even in the United States.
The Oberbayer community Ramsau at Berchtsgaden is the first "Bergstigerdorf" Germany.
From the hand of the Vice-President at the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the National Park of Berchtesgaden received the exhibition for sanct tourism.
In Austria, there are already 20 "groups".
In the neighbouring country, the daily Alpenverein is responsible for the delivery of the exhibition.
A "grouperdorf" may have at least 2500 inhabitants.
At least one five of its area must be designated as a protection area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the assessments, despite the trials of Nine, to take the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson go to Canberra to report the loss of Liberal leadership, but there has not been a great delay in the reviews for today.
The breakfast show of Nine was stretched by the Bundeshaut city when Malcolm Turnbull created the street of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderns David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a weekly series of international television sentences, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This part of the distance seemed not to play a role for Australian TV surveys, since Sunrise has averagely reached 397.000 viewers at the five main cities, compared to Today 339.000.
Today achieved an easily increase in the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Thursday (283.000), but his number remained behind the last Thursday (343.000).
Today has closed the sunrise light in the last months.
In August, today reached 318.000 in average comparison with the 33.000 Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance remained between 400,000 and 500,000.
Since September, Sunrise has 349.000 viewers of 334.000 viewers in today.
This is the most interesting thing that makes every morning.
The wind of the change is more than the Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for the check!

The great news for Seven was the impressioning debt of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently exposed father, who decided to leave with his two children in the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Criticers had asked whether Thomson could have a Hit-Show Solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily shot The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results at evening two of the Chase日a.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17.30) of the new Quiz-Show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, produced in average 446.000 surveys.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) runs to 623.000 viewers - enough for a small winning over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday, the first half hour of the Chasea reached 520,000 surveys and set 720,000 in the second half hour.
Hot seat average 620,000.

The Chase日a is a replacement for a million minutes that couldn't overflow the McGuires Show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret Enth? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have uncertainly seen who wins the Bachelor.
The woman that landed at the Sam Wood in The Bachelors, was held in greater secretary.
And no of the three remaining girls will certainly be priced whether she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before they became three, you may have probably given a notice of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the end of Thursday
All three women have sold themselves in the lyrical way about the reason why Wood is the perfect man and call his sense of humor, honour, family values and positive attitude as a reason why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers to the player who wined the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both called quickly - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have made a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Saraahs) and Sam's energy, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that in the entire history of the show," said Jeavons Felovws.
"Saraah is with two feet on the earth, it makes it so fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemical.
They feel pleasant and comfortable.
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suitable as a couple.
From her view Mackay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood could be "the One".
"When I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is not only a game - I'm now inconsistently on him," she said.
And when she was asked, who should choose wood, if not she, she was disgusting.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls at the same time - it's an unexpected difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is stretched at the middle of the week, 19:30, on the Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL card.
Detroit and Seattle showed a great interest in the turn to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent an open training day after printing the end of the last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and Tra ́ Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trees would have rejected Hayne for the game to the bank when he lost a garangle as did the Russia-Rugby-Liga conversion at the first point return on Sunday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also in the running game after a damage of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true view in the cabine of the ombreak after the game.
Instead of moving his fucking rooks before the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strongly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49th Sport reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also motivated by the Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGiehey, who wants him to forget his dismissed fish and care for the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pat日 at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start, the Hayne and its massive Australian succession for his NFL debt.
Hayne left the game field after the Fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not imagine a bader start in his NFL card,
"It was a thing that happens now, you're just concerned about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compares the bridge with Origin Debout at the same time in 2007, when a pass in its own in-goal area led to a triumph for Queensland.
However, it was a wonderful experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne put for a photo with fans and holds a Australian flag after the game and puts it on instagram.

Aiwanger requested the establishment of UN shot zones for refugees, as it was during the Yugoslavia war in the nine years.
"It's not going on, we need the causes," said the free electoral boss.
Rejected asylum applicants want the free choosers to discover as quickly as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also requested more staff for the administrative judges responsible for asyl claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum directors," said Aiwanger.
The FW head criticized that several federal countries were not consequently: "We need common standards of the federal countries."
"Bayern's off, others don't."
"There we must be more able to handle."
However, the country's policy in a large town should not fall under the table.
A year-related long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For a new school year, the Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot trial "Middle level plus" at 47 Gymnasium, testing a prolongation of the gymnasial average levels of three to four years - in the result it takes again nine years until the Abitur.
But it's not enough for Aiwanger.
"The G9 theme must be cleaned," said the FW head.
We request the freedom of choice for all the Gymnasians who want it.
Free travel at G9 wherever it is desired.

Several injuries are still disappointed - they protect the exemption of their free time.
For months behind closed doors was negotiated, stuck, debated and thrown.
Now the plans for a new apartment in the Small Sea are near Emden on the table.
The interesting member, the Mediterranean Emder Company "System-Bau", presented its plans first on Montagued in the City Development Committee of the Emmer Council on Montague.
This point was originally stated on the non-governmental part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group, which prevented the investor and the administration of the secretary area, Ralf Behrends from the system-build business guide to the opening: "We have no answer to all questions," he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to meet all the pleasures now.
The debate has been discussed for months of approximately 12 million euros.
Great reactions among maritime owners who had come to the meeting were called the pictures and new details for the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, maritime owner and representative member at the interests of the Aneuer, Pro Hieve, claims: "This will be a riesenclotz that will overcome all other languages."
In addition, he fears, as some other project critics, that the vere would be strengthened by the size of the installation: "They must come all bus loads to calculate it," such a school
What exactly happens on the good hectare of the former guests is still open.
There's no driver yet.
"The first thing we have to have a final concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the building plans were even variable.

NHC says 60 percent chance for cyclon south of the Capverd Islands
The US National Hurricane Center said on Sunday a wide deep pressure system of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Capverd Islands, which has a 60 percent opportunity to develop in the next 48 hours to a tropical raw storm.

Google starts double-S campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a Duplication S campaign to bring 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrolled the European N°, since they flee from the war, scattered and armed countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to notify the call on the Blog.
Instead of allowing a manager to make an announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google partner who is with her family from Kabul, when she was seven years old, wrote about their personal experiences.
"To our journeys belonged many dark travelers and bus travelers, as well as hunger, dust, cold and hot," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refuge and migration crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are trying to do so for help.
The S° is available to four useful organizations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants: doctors without limits, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for refugees.
Google said that the first global collected S→ will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refuge relief to $11 million.
Europe has been confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, which has caused largely the four-year civil war, which has destroyed more than 4 million people this year.
They also fled from the disappeared Afghanistan, Jemen, Iraq and Libya.
Report of Yasmeen Abutaleb; Christian P日
For light overweight diabetes, weight loss chirurgy may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss chirurgy for light overweight people with type 2 diabetes can dure at least five years after a new disorder.
It is too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss chirurgic than those receiving non-chirurgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a expert of weight loss chirurgie, who wrote a leadership to the new area in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss-opera or AdiPropertyas chirurgie, use various methods to reduce the size of the magnesium.
They reduce hunger and limit the body-specific ability to take up.
Over the years, Adiezzas-Oper was shown to be treated by type 2 diabetes as efeuten, but most of them were conducted in people who are sickly painful with a body-mass-index (BMI) of 35 or.
BMI, a certain weight weight measure in respect of size, shall be used as normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI more than 30 are deep.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new areas, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital Data that have collected in a Property since 2007 and compared two types of AdiPropertyas-chirurgie - Magenbypass and magen-shopping - to medical treatments for type-2 diabetes in people who were easily overwhelming.
The average BMI of those under this operation was from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year in this loop.
In addition, the BMI remained in those who received non-chirurgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who were under a chirurgical intervention, the diabetes disease was totally solved in 36% and in 28% partly.
In the medical treatment group, the diabetes was totally solved in comparison with one pro and partly at about two Pro.
Moreover, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglyceride and the "what" LDL cholesterin were "in general better in the "chirurgical" group" were found by the authors.
The researchers also monitor the blood level of hemoglobin A1c that reflects the blood sugar values during the time.
Hemoglobin A1c is maintained at the best under 7 Pro·, write the researchers.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c level of approximately 9% was decreased to approximately 6 Pro.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at approximately 8 Pro.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce death in five years, so the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares the average results of the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass-chirurgie group had lost more weight (18.7 per cent of 14.2 kg), increased BMI returns (7.4 against 5.1) and the haemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent per 2.5.1 per cent) and also increased the full survival of the diabetes (46.9 %/16.7 %).
Since the new area does not show the survival benefit of the chirurgical survival after five years, there are indications from a series of more difficult people in Sweden that the operation leads to a longer life, Blackstone says of the Areuna College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish, there was fatiguous people who were under a operation of AdiPropertyas, about 29 Pro ́ less probably died during 15 years -- compared to a group who sought the conventional methods.
Although the new holder did not show any benefit to survive in the chirurgical patients, Blackstone said that it was motivating for persons with a BMI under 35 who were interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this section because she says that this operation in this BMI group is lower," she said without increased risk of death or renal disease.
Blackstone adds that humans and their doctors should begin to take serious weight as long as the patient with BMI lies between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think soon as they have collected these genetic changes that have firmly connected their body with fatigue and diabetes, it is really difficult to recycle."

"It is impossible that everyone comes to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe is not able to take all refugees, said Dalai Lama and said that the real solution of the refugee crisis is in the Near East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of the advanced refuge crisis at the beginning of his day-day epoche in the United Kingdom in his speech on the exercise of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which divides ethical studies.
He requested that the interests of humankind be placed in the circumstances given in front of the interests of individual N.O. or even continents.
He also pointed out that the reaction of the Western countries to the refugee crisis was valuable, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama Germany and Austria's efforts were praising the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of a number of thousand refugees, but in the meantime you have to think of long-term solutions, such as a real peace and real development, mainly by education, which can be created for these muslim countries," he stressed.
Let us consider how the murder will be decreased in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and also commented George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and concluded that the violent reaction of the United States was a cat of uncontrolled events.
After September 11, I had a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in violence.
"I know that his motives were good, but he put violence in, and that has brought up unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the administration of hand-infections by children in the last 4 years
Gift controllers in the United States report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years, which swimming strong alcoholic infections, as the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of injection of hand-infections in children under 12 years reporting gift controls have increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"The children are always more frequent to these products, and, unfortunately, there is a degree of them in the record," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink defectively, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a temptation in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how youths drink infection only because of a pleasant experience.
Young people have seemed to have mixed defection medicines with alcoholic sustainable mouth water in order to get a worse drink.
Disciples can be locked by attractive depths of defectives.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
The attractive (hand-deinfektion) are those who are parfumed.
There are defectives with landbuilding, wine and olive dust that are very responsible for children.
Manual infections contain anywhere between 45 and 95 Pro alcohol.
In the case of small children, a few sprinters may lead to alcohol injury.
"It's the highest coin of alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, the medical director of the phone call room at the hospital of the University of Kansas, the Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let the whisky stone, but people let this hand-deinfektion in the richest of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick chance to consume many alcohol.
Nhajah, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four sprinters of a living hand-infection in the school, was brought into a notice for treatment.
Her blood alcohol convergence was 179, twice as the wheel that is used legally to be drinked in a adult, Dr. Chris Ritchey, a note-ar, who treated her in Gwinnett Medical Centre outside Atlanta.
Nhayah rejected her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the record.
Physicians watched at night in a separate child hospital on signs of brain-trauma, since the girl was fallen through the alcohol and had shot the head, Ritchey said.
"It was very amazing," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaiyah's mother, CNN.
It could be death for my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use alcoholless products or defects and to store hand infections outside the richest of the child.
In addition to alcohol inflammation, some defects were related to death cases.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after the slaughter of hand-infection infections that had a toxic, unpleasant suit.
Workers of health participants believe that the product contained methanol, a mortal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, noted as active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planted their "general" teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the education room," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic against hand-infection infections and extracted her out of her room.
The police viewed the plan "smoking" and referenced disciplinary measures to the school members.

The lack of titles in Scotch football long-term Netherlands - the Boer
The former Rangers Mediterranean player and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that the Netherlands football funds have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title-rivality with the rangers.
The Boer, currently a newspaper for Ajax, said, "In Holland, do they not show high points of the Celtic Games anymore and why?"
It's because the rangers are not there.
People here are not just talking about the back of the rangers.
You're talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams and that's what they're interesting.
There is a lot of spending in the Old Company Games, and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn the things around, swear Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian head swears to turn the things.
After the delay against Malmoe and the following exemption from the Champions League, the decline from 10 men from Aberdeen, now with five points of predsp, was clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out there as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are very, very wow or trist about what happens.
We feel that exactly - but we need to continue.
We really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players better.
Now, it is so important to be together.
Warburton carefully at January Transfers
Despite his comments only a few weeks ago, which suggested that he shared some transmissions in January, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is carefully at the signature of new access and does not want to slip the unit of the Ibrox Caders.
The ex leader of Brentford said, "The January Transfer window is very different from the sommer window."
The players coming in the summer have this pre-session time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The family is really good.
Sometimes more damage is created by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic-destination person Michu with backtrace indication
Swansea-Stormer Michu, with Celtic during the transmission period during the interview, indicated that he could go back when his contract is executed at Swans.
The 29-year-old has been bound with a late kitchen since two years and has not created the outcome from Wales in this summer.

Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The inappropriate Hibee was adjusted after he agreed to have sing a song with anxious text over Ex-Hearts Players Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a nepe in the area of Roseburn of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the hit of the moment," said the stubber and fêe to add, "It's safe to say that I'm not back to Tynecastle if it's not playing for Celtic Glassgow."
Tannadice Watch Council has trust in Dundee-United Management

Derek McInnes recalls that his community from Aberdeen had to fight against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh follow-up liga-seek, which introduced to them a five points before Celtic on the top side of the table thanks to Adam Rooney Elfmeters in the first half-time.
McInnes said, "There is no community who has won everything, in pocal games or lying, the games of this kind haven't even won't."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it grows in the United Kingdom.
The unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164.000 in May to July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole period of 10,000 to 1,82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 Pro > was over the UK of 5.5 Pro, as the numbers of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shown.

A 28-year-old man had 2,15 promille and remained at the watch.
Why I will be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for a later legal intervention, I will see how a man will be put to death.
If it comes, and I hope that it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a survey gallery in the death room in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the spider.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at death.
The invitation was already done first in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day was closer, I began to be afraid.
So why should I do that?
I agreed because I thought it would be a chance to tell the whole story of death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see arrangements in the United States, and because often more requests are available than places, there is a good lottery place to decide who is selected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected, he will watch it without emotional.
I can't.
I'm going to sit close to Richard Glossips, a genuine friend with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with phones and a two and half hours ago.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison auditors say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so it will not be allowed to get a notebook and a stick to what I see.
I just have to try to remind me of all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me to give my independence to Twitter.
Here's the lection.
Tell the story of the arrest as he wants it, and you get access.
I'll be charged with her.
She realized that she could better formulate it, but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I had to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of Witnesses at any time.
But he wants a international reporter to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work will help the movement against death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit near me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I've done.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't make sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would cause him to be a beneficiary of the fact.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I believe that there are no sufficient evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his order is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to which you can turn to.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man die in need of death.
Man convinced to come out of the Canning River after the flight of police persecution
The Canning Vale Police remained thirsty when he convinced the man from the Canning River.
A trial of a man from Perth, to decline the police, was unfortunate when he was in the low and smoked water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "softly overlook him to return to the village."
The police of Canning Vale was called on Sunday to a house-friend-broch accident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the contemporary, this man tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I don't come out, come and take me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too disappointed to make his uniform nose, so he turned a more reliable tactic to - "A good cope negotiated."
"People people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Mastership football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins went his car into the graves to escape a alcohol control and then tried to flee over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired inheimic to the humoral planning of Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards are trying to spy him and try to finish the Rennesport
Peter Moody claims that Stewards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spion in his places in the past year and threatened to quit the run immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching because of the treatment of the Rentungges, the last hole in the middle-week.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the Rennesport and he had seen himself under difficult conditions as it was about the positive cobalt tuberculosis test at Lidaris that he couldn't explain.
He had 18 months back because of the spionage prejudice and didn't want it to look like too much too deep.
"I was supposed to say nothing about it, and I've seen long on it, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out once," said Moody.
You know it's going on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to take up the highest heads, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying for them.
If they start thinking I don't do it, I shouldn't be a tree anymore.
Then I have to figure out what I'm doing with my license.
Before Moody had allowed the bomb to go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had attempted to spy his stale.
"Eight months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - which I will call when I'm asked - and offer him a job in my places to provide information about what I'm doing in my places," Moody on Racing.com.
You think I'm a wounder.
If this is the case, they should certainly take care of their noses because they have refused to believe me at trying to believe me.
Robert Roulston, before. President of the RVL, David Moodie, official President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the RVL, were conscious of this time and are still today.
Does this make me feel that it will be personal?
Has the RVL behaved hard and may make people outside the trainers responsible for what is happening in the brainch?
I'm bad for the brain?
I'm so bad for the brain?
Maybe people think out there I am.
Maybe they have to take my licence and kill me, and I don't doubt that what I'm saying, let her think about now.
But now I'm coming to the point that I don't care about this, and that makes me sorrow.
That really makes me sorrow.
I'll exercise the pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the Tra’s has built up with the long-term cobalt search at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to he said that he could throw his licence over the table.
Moody, in the best place by preparing the unrapped Master Black Caviar, was the Renday treatment rule "slackly", after a packaging was opened on the horse feet, which was contrary to the rules.
"It's against the rules of the Rennesport.
I must take the full responsibility for it," he said.
"It's wrong to my employee that's opened a lamp on my feet.
It could be that last night.
It could be all the day yesterday, what it was.
But it also had it on Friday.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the packaging on the Renday. A study of this matter was opened.
It's a shit.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you've gone too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after running
The police arrested a man on the week after a meeting with a driving driver and then a driving flight in Cobram.
The railway was delivered with the hobshawder in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious damage after he was met by a car on the Murray Valley car on the Sunday morning.
The police said that the car driver continued without stoping to help the lost driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia of the police in Shepparton.
It will be probably accused of flights and support services and of other departments.
The radiator, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital. He is in a stable state.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Bellamy turns back against rivals because of rivals to ring combats
Melbourne-Storm Trainer holding Bellamy used criticism on the tackling of his player as "Agenda-Setting" by two Premier League Favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Tra · Trent Robinson said that the ship judges have allowed the storm games "Ring Conflict" with a team during the high storm sequence in the Qualifying Fine in Sydney on Friday.
Brisbane Broncos Tra Family Wayne Bennett made a little disturbed comment on the storm team after his family had reached the final look against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday. He called the game a "master example" of Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tacklimg of his family and said she could only be able to be on their "contakt".
Bellamy adds that the criticism of two leaders tree to his community is convinced, because it means that they were concerned about being killed by the storm team.
"I haven't heard that Trent Robinson talked about Ring Conflict when they struck us 24:2," Bellamy said in the middle-week.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or technology throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real point, and that has brought the trends for us.
Trent has now been there for three years, and he has obviously had to train a great multitude, so he is probably not used to lose it, so it was a little shock for him.
It's already funny how this happens again at this year.
Bellamy attacked Bennetts' idea of the "speaking football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "language" football.
Wayne's talking about pressing football.
He compared his game on Saturday with our Friday and how exciting it was her game," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a long-term team, and Wayne said he would take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we view as stressing, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters has achieved a result than the Broncos game against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was a game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16:12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more trials in our game, but is that a surprising game?
Or are breaks, and no points are something spending?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they're surprising us, it means that we're still going to meet them in a phase.
The storm team is free at this weekend because they have won the right, or North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next weekend in the prefinal in the AAMI Park. The ticket up starts from the next morning.
Serbier with $200,000 purchase after accusation
A man who may have suffered a long penalty because of his trial to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of cocain, who were shot to Queensland, was released against a caught of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drugs on the Yacht Solay, coming from South America over Vanuatu and set up in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was observed how he met his complaints in Jachthafen during the morning and later in the Coomera Roadhouse café, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible long-term penalty for trying to make a commercial quantity of cocain, the lawyer of Maksimovic argumented that there was no evidence that he tried to acquire the whole amount and that it could have been in the café for an unfair reason.
The judge of the Master Court of Justice, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the running at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the Court at the Middle Week.
In the case of the penalty, he claimed the police about his residence.
Maksimovic's mother and Stif Father had offered a cabinet of 200,000; as a security together to gain his release.
"By reading of the public statements of the two persons, it is clear that the establishment of a security of 200,000 is a real financial burden," said judge Flanagan.

Maksimovic was released against cutting, under the conditions that he left his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police daily and kept on an output lock of 18:00-06:00.

Stevan Hogg used by girls to lock pedophile to send pictures
A child used the telephone of a 11 - year - old girl to ask images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when he slept, logged into a online messageing series from which he received a number of unexpected pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later wake up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it, found the surprising reports and alarmed her mother immediately.
The police cared about it and saw the five pictures, then analysed the computer found under the address and discovered "related" web searches, which used the terms for search for inconsistent images of children.
Hogg then said to the employee that he did it because it would lead to "Pedophile on the Internet" and then "delayed to be a policeman to scare them."
The state advocate Eilith Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "he said it would be a search - he was careful to scare people.
He told that the search on the computer was performed by him, but he said that it happened because he was supposed to be a police officer to fear the pedophile.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him and asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lock them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and said he wanted to see pictures of mystery and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the tissue and at the wine.
Then she also saw the inconsistent pictures on the phone and confronted the complaint with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and playstation used to talk to girls that looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared himself responsibility in the sense of the accusation to have taken inconsistent pictures of children on 14 June last year, to have murdered on 25 January of this year and not to have occurred before the court on 24 March of this year.
Defense advocate Gregor Sim asked for Hogg not to appear in the director of sexual criminals, because you can argument that "no evidence of sexual element" would be found in the process.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael dismissed the sentence to October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted in this case, however, because of consultations with other events still existing in investigation.
He was included in the list of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.

One of the largest premises for the German car rental is the Opel Astra, which will be in herbst with the vendors.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel Chief Karl-Tomas Neumann said on the middle.
He belongs to the edge of the mark.

The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is with a new 1,4 liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.

JVA Berlin box: Five square meters cells are human inadequate
The Bundes Constitutional Court has directed a former employee of the executive execution of the Tegel, which was undertaken in a too small cell for months.
Because of the damage of human killings, prisoners have fundamentally insisted on financial disorder when they are undertaken too small cells.
This has decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on the middle-week.
The employees may, according to the judges, even then hope for money if they were only few days in the rooms to be locked (p. ex.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
In this regard, an ex-capital with his constitutional trial in Karlsruhe: He was in the execution of Berlin, between June and November 2009, in a single cell with approximately five square meters of the ground area; the toilet was not spaciously distracted.
Afterward, the man who was replaced by his lawyer's information on the middle of his free foot was put into a larger cell.
Although his officer's complaint for the unworthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin was determined.
However, the Constitutional judges raised the Court of Justice of Berlin and showed the case to renew Dorthin.
You see the human murder of the man.
Chamber Court now decides on the height of the defraudment
Even if for legal reasons of the questionary period only a few days of detention for the debt, a compensation is given, it was said.
In other cases, "the protection of personality would be "a defender of the right of personality".
The Court of Justice must now cover the height of the money charge.
The Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners in the past.
So they talked to a prisoner in April because he was locked in a cell.
A decision from 2011 is also due to the multi-fold design of a cell without separate toilet.
Moreover, Karlsruhe was held in the middle of the middle of the Berlinian Constitutional Court Chair, which confirmed a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 a human inadequate transmission.
The daily complaint was taken over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in Karlsruher case.
The Berlin prisons were also in the past weeks because of the failing staff.
Therefore, the prisoners are still included 23 hours, and the aggressivity increases, and it has already occurred because of the stressed situation.
After the exhibition of the court pressure, 21 posts are not occupied for adult failure, 19 will fall 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refuge policy: "We create this"
The migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the federal cancer has decided to take it.
What's going on in Germany?
At the end of 800 000 asylum applicants will come to Germany in this year, according to the statement of Vicekanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take a million refugees.
Concern Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can create it, and we create it."
What is happening to Germany, the following review.
By various prognoses between 350000 (the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (the Pestel Institute) apartments will be used annually - and for the next five years.
This is almost double as long as it is built up to now (250000 apartments).
The lack of residence is dramatic, but especially in payable middle objects: Annually, 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall from the middle price binding, and for these special favorable apartments, refugees will also be requested.
Bundesbau Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the support, from now on 518 million to a billion euro.
It is too short that it is from the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social apartments should be each year and that the Bund should invest a contribution of 6,4 billion per year.
In addition, the Community and the Federal Ministry of Construction must have more tax benefits for investment in the building of apartment.
According to the Institute for Working and Professional Research, a long-term 55% of the refugees in Germany may be acquired.
However, the refugees in Germany would not have been systematicly asked for their qualification to help them in the entry, criticized by Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann establishment.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is determining whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the assessment of the recording society, but also for the self-valuation of the immigrants, the migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt says.
In Germany it sounds that Thränhardt has given a political wandel: by the labour prohibition for refugees to recognize work.
Since there was a labour prohibition for asyl applicants from up to five years earlier, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation to restrict the asyl applicant to a residence.
In the company, too, because of the professional angle, most of the views that refugees should be enabled to enable access to work.
A large guard for access to work is a failure of German knowledge.
There is no longer adequate boat on general and relevant language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are most commonly delivered by personal contacts.
The building of networks is therefore viewed as Thränhard the road of the King to work integration.
The Berliner School Administration has found that only a few of those who are sorrowing parents give their children in the China, estimatedly up to 15 Pro日: "For the developed parents it is only important to keep the family together," Ilja Koschembar, speakers for youth and family in the Berlinian Senate Administration.
To convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, however, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.
If the need for exhibitors increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlinian Senate would try to increase educational skills - sometimes by allowing more schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge will be prepared for the education.
But they are not always teached by full-learned teachers and teachers, but, like in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as second.
They have no lack, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Management.
The German student work appreciates that about 20% of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no Bundesland asylum applicants or patienced - the only exception was until Berlin, the internal Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given his view.
The access to high school could be facilitated by voluntary refugees.
Since refugees with a residence or duration have no services in accordance with the asylum requesting law when they start an area.
Latests are based on no bathroom because they do not fall under the circle of the persons authorised.
Persevered refugees had to have been held in Germany until four years to be equipped with Bafög, from 1 January 2016, at 15 months this Spanne has been reduced.
In addition, these financing happiness must be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Economy, and the German student work.
They should be able to get bathroom immediately.
The Islam will futurely play a more important role, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, the religion is the important part of their integrity.
The State should susceptiblely pursue the same rights to Islam as they have the churches and continue to develop the existing State-Christian law to a new State-religious relationship.
It would also be important to create a islamic well-being band, which is professionally concerned with the newcommunities.
The rights also belong to complaints.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must be ready to cooperate with the State in many areas and to set some control options to him.
It also belongs to the preparation to be better against religious fundamentalism.
The president of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday, religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to exclude such conflicts in Germany, "have their right to live here, in Germany," he said in Bayrische.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will futurely be a subject of the whole society more than today.
In order to change the majority society, the decrease of discrimination and racism will be more difficult.
However, Germany has, as a result of decisions - since a Button year, an anti-discriminatory body and a general equality law.
However, it learns very lately, as the NSU murderer showed, that in the police and authorities the racial motive systematicly ignored.
The same opportunities for all: what migrant organizations and interest groups of non-white Germans have long requested and committed international agreements like the German Anti-Rassism Convention must be effective in the next years when the country remains peaceful and will use its new citizens and citizens their opportunities - for the welfare of all.
Generally, Germany is able to provide healthy refugees until now, President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"What man-power and capabilities concerns, we will make it," he said to the daily level.
However, it has to flee to the system of social money.
To avoid engmasses, Montgomery requests all attendants to identify health cards at the same time when registered.
The benefits made may be calculated later with the federal countries.
And long-termly se it is most fragile, so many people dismiss with the restricted service catalogue, which provides the asylum application law.
On the other hand, doctors are especially making the language barriers.
Moreover, the Berliner health scientist Thea Borde has proved that migrants are worse about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, including in the Ar practices, dolmetschers should be taken, it requests.
However, many refugees would have been helped with more general medical stations in the emergency campaign.
And with another kind of wedding.
Under refugee children, there are clearly more untreated obstacles, and youths are about HIV-aspects.
With the part of other disease images, German doctors are clear from their education, but Montgomery says.
"Parasite or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as regards the lack of the doctors, the refugees may even be blinded in view.
The Syrers had a highly developed educational system, some refugees were even doctors.
To be able to practice, however, they should prove their qualification and may be tested again.
At least the half of the refugees coming in Germany is psychologically sick after the disorders of the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): most of them suffer under a posttraumatic burden of depression or depression.
In the case of a vulnerable refugee child, the President of the BPtK explains Dietrich Munz.
A recent publication of the TU München states that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatised in Germany.
Whoever is infected with a posttraumatic loading stage, including the so-called flashbacks are suffering with an atmosphere, swine, heart race and death anxiety.
Other symptoms are slaughter and conspiration, strong terribility and emotional taste.
In order to prevent the symptoms would be chronic, a early treatment should be needed, stated Munz.
However, until long, only four of the psychologically diseased refugees have a psychotherapy.
In order to make a request for a psychotherapy, the processing takes more than a few months.
Moreover, in social areas, most experts or doctors who are not educated for psychological diseases would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to failure assessments, says Munz.
Many dream to dream
With the new inscenation "Listenship" the Circus Test returns to the traditions of the circus art.
The goal is to drag each age group into the bank of fascinating acrobatics, animal resources and single entertainment.
Now the Circus Test is putting into the many of the dreams to dream.
"Our patience is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living my circle family," Stephanie's test, animal teacher, and Junior headfine says.
"Listenship" - under this motive is the current manipulation.
For more than 33 years, the circus is in the hands of the family test.
So the gift to pleasure is in the blood.
"We are important to take people away from their everyday street and take them into a completely different world for two hours," stresses the 27-year-old Juneor Chief.
"Manegen Cocktail with World City-Flair", so the director Reinhard Test calls his concept.
50 towns at the nearly 3000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The cycle program is convinced with talented artists from the whole world.

Even the Castillo Brothers understand their handwork.
With the herds of the stomach films, it wants to take the cuban duo locker.
Easyness and movement - with these words they identify themselves.
His humorous art in the mast is to obtain female herbs in the storm.
Besides many laughing salts, the acrobatic of the Circus Test also fascinates with fingerprint feeling and liquidity.
Balance with the inside on a bottle?
It's not a problem for He Yuan.
Fascinate and scare snow men together.
Wang Lin from China is trusted with the oldest form of acrobatic as little other and fascinated with their movement.
60 employees of 12 N ́ offer in every regard.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephany's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disturbances in the maintenance of circles are only too often the subject in different animal protection organizations.
Stephanie Probst also states: "If our animals are not good, it's not good to us."
80 animals from five different continents enjoy each street unit.
The "fourthin' artists", as they are called lovingly, will be read of any desire from the eyes as possible.
We want to cooperate with the animals and enjoy them.
If the animal doesn't feel it, it doesn't want it to be in the manner.
The main command is, so, that it is good for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture from a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastut, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have joined eight years in a gage and nothing is made.
"And then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," Brigitte Provst said.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manage, but it is the unique mascotch of the Circus Test.
So for every surgery, there must be something to do.

He remained unexpected, but the video of the case was quickly spread over the social media.
The vote of the Parliament was also entrusted by the deputy of the opposition ladies that they had received anonymous death threats and that they had been warned to join Mr Mugabe with buh calls.

HP will later share in two banknotes companies in this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fastest growing business hardware and its service business activities.

FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that team colleagues must stand behind the damaged Jack Wilshere
Wenger pointed to Wilshere that it was first September and if his rehabilitation remains in plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Wednesday.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly pass at least the next four games for England and his story has its share in the next summer to the European Mastership still uncertain.
The big shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had completed the last season after a separate kidney disorder and then had found back too old weight during the season.
"This kind of damage doesn't threaten the karèe," said Wenger.
It's a bone that's not good.
This isn't a greater matter.
This was just a accident.
It wasn't associated with his knees or the damage he had before.
This may be true from pure medical view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the corresponding range of other damage, always when a player tries to get back in the middle of the season.
It also develops an inappropriate pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd has exposed 23 different illnesses of Wilshere since six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 games in the last five games.
The widest image for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League Clubs that have been devoted to the most damage days since 2007/08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that a improvement in the damage rates during the last season will take place.
"As you come back from a hurt, you have an accidental period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win battle force," Winger said.
Jack's young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body is stabilised, I'm sure he's gonna do it and he'll run a car from the way he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions-League season at Middle Week against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur in the middle of the next week, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not traveling to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should be started.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nao Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the equality and to the players that need to give a small breakout," winger said.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue through group F, the maximum station in Zagreb belongs to the playplaces with the largest impact in Europe.
Dynamo has also been killed after 41 games after the "insecure" campaign has been started in the last season.
The stadium was charged by a landbeach on Thursday evening, with 3,2 places at the court scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is thinking that Arsenal has made the learning from the past season with the Champions-League capital against Monaco and remains driven by the remote hope to lead to the first European pocal triumph with the management.
"This operation is incredible," said Wenger.
It's never got in Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but, on the other hand, I'm long enough in business to be realistic.
We're honest, but we're not dreams.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The failure of similar presentations in shows is obviously, especially in view of how the need for men to open themselves now has become more disappointed than ever before, like self-mords among young men at a 15-year-old high.
In 2013 there was the most important cause of death in men from 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom, and there remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In efforts to reach the problem, the campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a heavy life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the goal of putting the culture in question, preventing men from seeking help if they need them.
Friendship is the heart piece in the battle to meet this challenge.
A current range in more than 2.000 high school school students with depressive symptoms stated that if the patient had a sufficient high prosecution to friends with "sound voting", his chances of genetic treatment were doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of spiritually healthy friends met the risk of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends once so that a friendship can work.
In the age of the communication on social media, with its focus on substance style, the immediate response is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital life has the need to appear strong, liveliable and doubled, even though it actually dominates the isolation.
This surface success is dominated by what psychologists call out external values; money, image, social status, everything to the costs of internal values - our inner look for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health much deeper.
And as a video player and a billioner recently explained, money can't really buy happiness.
The niceness in Friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which cleared by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's often disturbances, moments on football buckets in lowly seasons and Ross' seasons to Rachel - all that came from the fact that men can relate to any case, even though they are often stopped, completely recognizing their feelings.
As a phone career explained, "My listener's role for people who feel depressive and self-mothered has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a subsequence."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old talk "I'm going to be right" has a huge effect, how the feeling that it will be seen as weak when you talk about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I'm trying to offer long-term mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
So much my objective external status on the phone can also help people at the moments of disturbance, which long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekly Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely new-formed colis on the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a laugh and tell him Hello.
You never know what subsheed can make your friendship.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for #friendsFest
Marie matches to help PSG break Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after meeting against Malmo.
Maria met with the Champions League on Sunday and helps PSG to go to Malmoe.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League Seison with an extremely comfortable 2-0 winning against Malmö in the Prince Parkstadion on Thursday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the beginning of his Champions League Debuts as PSG player, who held the French master on the road, but then lost a number of opportunities before they finally increased their intention, when Cavani reached a headballtor in the 61 minutes.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk in the group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, not only seeking the K.O. Runds, but a improvement on the road to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they received the points, there was no classic game of Laurent Bla ́s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics. He was later changed in the game against his home city team and the association with which he started his illustrated Karèe already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or outside in the Champions League. Therefore, it's a good start to win 2:0 to cause our enemies problems and relax, even though there are certain things that we need to perfection during the season," said Bla日.
"This is a sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I'm worried that we haven't reached one or two other gates."
Ibrahimovic returned after his damage in one of the three changes in the Paris team, which could hold a 2:2 unexpectedly on its own place against Bordeaux in the first Liga, but was exhausted in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The argentinian flight storm was obscured as the man who could take PSG at the next level in Europe when he was taken in the last month of Manchester United, and he noted why when he entered in Marco Verrattis Pass behind Malmoe defense before he ended nicely in the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would make a big victory that was disappointed.
Malmoe, the Celtic shot in a play-off to achieve this level, came with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a serious enemy.
But besides a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, which was far on Kevin Trapps Pfots in the 34 minutes, they were a little in attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes opened up, with some deficiencies and bad declines, not late -- of Ibrahimovic, who was not at least five trials only in the first half and then was given after Cavani had put it after the restart.
Yet, he proved much more choice when he played his companions in the game, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria transformed into a dress shot, which was made by Wiland in the 52th minute on the road...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer achieved his sixth seasonator after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flat of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmoe could return to the game, and only an excellent attack of Wiland from the latest distance to stop David Luiz, the final result could be low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was identified a gate at the end.
The tree of Malmoe, Age Hareide, later told that PSG played a class of team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions-League game was in December the last year.
Since then, we have just played in the Swedish Liga, which does not have the same level.
The qualification games are not exposed."
Shut down from Paris!
It was a great game of them!

'American Ninja Warrior' crowns the first champion
Profi Sport Cletter and Service Aid Isaac Caldiero was the first Athlet who wined the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the large price of $1 million with home.
The competitive show that just ended its seventh season has never found a competitive participant who could complete all the levels of his barrier parcours.
During the season final, two men, Caldiero and the cameraman Geoff Britten, were created until the final.
The last task was the clothing of a 75 feet long screen in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time he was the first Athlet, who completed the stressing phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge in three seconds faster, which made him winner.
Caldiero talked to E!News after the heavy triggered win, still under the shock over the winning of the Great Price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never deserved more than $10,000 or get ha" said Isaac E! about his lot of money.
So suddenly as I can't imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading product ́ Kent Weed set up with the Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Britans, although he first ended the parcours, he did not receive any price payment.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.

He received a mass of exhibitions from Fans.
He's a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be killed by someone, I'm glad that it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had lost the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for a eighth staff, and the road work will be started in early 2016.

It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.

After they first received the Leadoff Battery, Hushes sent a single to the Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out Walk for J.D. Martinez made Victor Martinez in the game, which created a single "up the middle" at the first time of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The Baseman Nick Castelanos followed with a single on the right side, created another, but Victor Martinez was taken out of the game when he tried to achieve what the threat ended.
The Tigers set up in the second, reached a single-out double of Catcher James McCann and a two-out single of the Center Field Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"This was a big shot," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't be very good, but he did the right place.

At Hughes, there were three faces at six hits and a wall with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tiger RHP Anibal Sanchez differed because of hurting the students.

Rome now has a Martin-Luther place
Knapp 500 years after reform, there is now a Martin-Luther place in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a middle-week unnamed place in the park was baptized on the name of the German reformer in the park.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now appreciated as "Deutsch theology of reform".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome just next to the colosse.
The nomination was requested by the work community of the Gospel Churchs in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, Pfarrer of the Evangelical Luther assembly in Rome, noted in the middle-week that the Protestants in the city of the pastures were often able to live as a minority in secret.
With this place, in symbolic way, it will be visible that their tradition of Christian faith will be welcomed to Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) remained in Rome as a young August moon about the 1510/11 year.
He felt the city at that time as a sinful baby.
His negative impressions must have strengthened him as historicals viewed in later war against Rome.

Hammer artist invested three years in the Bible’s personal interpretation
Jesus is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has designed for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not in the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now come with famous pictures.
At the beginning, the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 Motiven formed his entire personal interpret of Bible stories on paper and linwand.
His "language" with bunch colors and fantastic forms has received the 75-year-old - which is no way equal to "lightful" images.
In contrast, the subject is adjusted, it can act just darkly.
In three years, Otmar Alt has made a Bible project, for which he has met an entity-artical selection from the many theme areas of the "books of all books".
Revolutions are cycles that divorce the subjects such as cross road, plans, commands or father's neighbors.
This has spontanly fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther's record with its theological orientation as well as for the Kettler's construction with the point of view on art books.
And there is, in particular, the author Klaus Altepost, who has seen one another on the basis of the malaria with the relevant Bible verses.
He interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus in today, in current conferences "translated".
These texts are as a verbal spiegel of old malerei.
They are incorporated between the original Bible citizen of Martin Luther and any set of the artist, which forms his entire personal thoughts on the situation.
The shocking band has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old will double a deep insight in his soul, his emotions.
This is a high measure of intimity.
Emotions were soon exposed to the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940, was born in Wernigerode and wake up in Berlin, come from a family belonging to the strict protestant Lord Hutter's order.
"There has happened with the rohrstock," Otmar Alt reminds.
"I've been trying to work this out to get me again with the Lord's Father."
His second advice is to help the art back to more place value at fast life: "The preservation of image worlds is now made by reclaims, and it is sound.
The symbolic is broken down there.
Artists have another pleasure and pleasure to show things.
Images always have something secret and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I'm a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "income" into the images, let them act, discover and see what power they have: "The image is looking for his opposite."
Klaus Altepost was on Thursday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Station, "only" was a lover of Otmar Alts Art: "I like he understands his life with his images."
Ancients have not regarded the full understanding of the Bible, but have chosen the important, and mysterious subjects for him.
"It wasn't co-operating at the higher eye," the old post says, "This is about the images that the text is just added." The objects are a picture Bible.
For Hans Mealers from Luther's campaign, this work is a invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alts Images speak for Möhlers both the (biblical) language of love and the responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and lining images - is first presented in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Station.
Building starts for BMX Building

So cover the hill, search for new space - now with formal planning and request for building approval.
The approval will be entered in October, and the first community of Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now communicate in the Child and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year is still visible," she said.
Then it should be started without "increasing memory pause" with the work in the former holiday bathroom.
DFB intensive commitment for refugees
The DFB provides its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend.
The football reacts to the emergency situation in Germany and ensures that it is helpful to cope with the problems that exist.

"There is no one who can say, that's nothing about me, I don't have anything to do with this."
"It must be interested in everyone to get this topic into the head," DFB-Chef Wolfgang Niersbach said.
At annual meetings with Bundeskanzle Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he will intensify the refugee situation in Germany.

"We also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," Leverkusens Sport Head of Rudi V ։

"We can be able to help the many fugitives who have already suffered so unbelievingly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's business leader Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of Liga".
For EM-qualification games against Hungary on Friday, the national community of women introduces 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach supported refugees as "a large Community work of German football".
That all 36 licences in their places had started their own projects would be great.
It's too great that small and smallst units are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, is located in the football.
"This is of great importance," he said.
In this and next year, the connection will be available together with the DFB election and the Federal Government for the integration of refugees in the DFB.
"The Uniteds have also received the whole sum for 2015," reported Niersbach.

Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture from a very large modeshow and a wachsfigure griscabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work in the middle of the week.
The height points: Shopping windows, which thanks to video projections, look awesomely humanly.
She is the speculatory creature of the French designer, which, among other things, became the Madonna Bünnenitfit to the big star of the \sen - and so that he put men in röcke.
"I can't say that I am the terrible child of the skin couture, because I have white hair."
"Before it seemed to be, in the meantime it's true," said Gaultier.
For the surveys of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To the Catwalk" (From the Civil Step on the Room), which is to see from September 18 in the arts of the hypo culture, it is a happiness that the Creator has changed his attitude to a view of his person at the beginning.
In fact, he was opposed, because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
When you die, you get into the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It's about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exposure gives an insight in the unforeseen work of the man who has written historical stories, without having ever taken a learning out.
Chronologically, the sight is not built, but it is a great crocheographed universal work for which a lot of opponents were carried out: to refresh the puppets, for example, a stylist has been involved.
14 tonnes of materials, the manufacturer has charged the curator's maximal therry Loriot to monkeys.
Shortly before the beginning of October, there was another special schmankerl: a lederhosen-outfit with corset.
Heidi met Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("Frous are more blind than men") and for men who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Even Gaultiers old te ́ is to be seen in the exhibition.
He's for the first, seen modesty in the designer's moodic trial.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in the football) he joined the Te日 BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a puppy, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He taught himself afterwards to the exhaust of Property.
He stole time records and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in München.
Later I bought them, of course.
He could not pay the models for his first mode view.
They didn't get anything, but they kept the clothes.
Schmuck town Gardine - Plained bridges as neck
Earlier, it entered the long stack machines and was to make meat.
The covered substances and spices occurred in a large number of customers who, for example, continue to cover and gardens.
This is no longer functioning today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, business leader of the spice Plauen.
Instead, it is important to be again.
In the early times of the Plauener Spitze played a greater role, then the home textile industry was weakened - and is now discovered as nick.
Reinhardt calls some examples: Spitze in Schmuck, Accessories such as shoes and regional searches.
In general, the so-called wintage mode, which refuses to past style pockets, is a lower task potential.
Whoever doesn't use niske in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already make the help of all the tasks.
Spice Plauen is together with nine other enterprises members of the Branchenband Plauener Spitze and Steppers.
Only they can make the label.
In the last 15 years, about 80% of the scope were canceled.
Agencies and the big trade are almost no longer available.
Our products do not get the customers in this way.
The massware will be produced much more billiger today in the Asian room and almost exhausted over cattle.
✔ weak exports, currently to Russia and to the United States.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The branch band also tries to point by environmental conscience, as Cordula Bauer explains: "We have led a quality signal since this year, which shows that we produce environmentally and socially significantly."
Reinhardt added: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplomdeigner Ute Schmidt teaches the Snowberger outside of the West Saxon High School Zwickau - at the Faculty for Applying Art - and is specialized on stakes and spits.
In order to resist the competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a spending field between the most fresh ideas of designers and the operations that must be economically thinking,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, a existing design is often easy to vary only to hold a customer group.
A few years ago, textile deigner Kati Re© rebuild the historical snowball.
This is what the machine puts some small kitchens in some places.
The Plauener Gold Schmidt Master Bianca Hallebach's crows inspired it: "I couldn't start with traditional Plauener Spitze."
Now she uses the snowball tickets for her shock.
In an outermost procedure, she draws the pattern in silver.
"Most people in the region are identified with the theme Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Re日.
It also delivers to the United States, after and to Finland - especially to customers who have been conducted in places and environments and wants to be a reminder.
That's what I see my beauty as a modern newsman of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plants new "Mary Poppins" movie
You don't want to touch, but Disney keeps a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, "Entertainment Weekly" does not refer to a new movie, but to a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic kids.
It's the experiences of Nanny with the family banks in the days of the world economic crisis in England.

EU wants to duplicate cuck-silver green value in raw fish
The European Commission wants to duplicate the limits for cocktails in large raw fish and thus give the consumers a clearly high dose of the nerve tax.
The Consumer Organization of Foodwatch, which provides a relevant work paper in the EU, criticized the plans: "The risks and reactions of misleading industrial and environmental policies will be continued with full growth to pregnancy and small children," said Matthias Wolfsmith of Foodwatch.
Following Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve tax for big fish at the end of the neighborhood vessel, such as a hair or sword fish for "economic reasons" shall be highlighted by one to two milligrams cuck silver per kilogram of fish.
However, big fishers are so strong today with cuck-silver that, on the basis of the still existing limits, about 50% of the prisons are not allowed to be overcome.
After duplicating the limit values, only 14,5 per percent would be impossible.
On the contrary to this lockering, the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from the currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of cheap silver per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, had this as a "track", because smaller fried fish, as about bottles, are mostly so lower that they are holding the maximum values planned today.
The decline in small fish is therefore "a perfeital delay manager that only helps the economy," explained Wolfschmidt.
Queck silver is a high-taxable sword metal for humans, which is strongly added to the narrow box, especially in raubfishes.
Therefore, the Federal Government warns that "small quantities of ready can cause particularly in the unborn damage of the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment explains, on his homepage, the maximum values applicable, but it is not expected to expect a "healthing of the general population".
Queck silver is especially obtained by the carbon burning into the environment.
The German carriage was based on a written outcome of the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Green-Bundtage Deputy, Baerbock, over six tonnes of cocktail per year, two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany.
The concurrence of Queck Silver in Fisheries around in Elbe, Rhein and Donau was "during and laterally covered," the "spray" had cited from the paper in the market.
In the past year, Europe's world warnings against cocktails in fish were already counted on the most common health risks reported in the EU warning system RASFF.
