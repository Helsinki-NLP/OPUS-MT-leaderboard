CSSD doesn't know Voldemort or Pattership in Prague.
The new elected CSSD at the capital mairi will apparently have to overcome a real language barry to understand at the level of the municipal advice with their older and new colleagues of the ODS.
The new members of the CSSD stated that they knew the argot that was born during the last years in the Marine, when they were the partners of the current coalition leading to Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political chrome has passed during the age of Master Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of metropolis.
It is surprised that it has been discovered that the new elections do not understand the terms with well.
At least they say it.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in Prague Policy reacted Luc Kaucky, the elue to culture at the test of the "parrain" vocabulary.
And with regard to the political veteran, Eul Karel Brezina has reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of golf.
"This is the only expression you offer me to use"
Otherwise, I don't use the argument.
From the vocabulary, whose day Actune.cz has taken the expressions in June of this year before the Pre-EEctral Congress of the ODS, the editor has chosen 6 examples, priorityly those associated with Prague's mairi.
The socialists to explain the sense of "Voldemort", "the largest golf ship in Prague", to the patience, to "norf of boeuf", "capital trahion" and "intoler".
Three of the elections were agreed for the chez, the fourth Antonin Weinert, who must guide the education in Prague in the future - promised all over a maintenance but then did not distort the phone.
The fifth elector Petr Dolinek carryed out the test.
"I don't care about all these things and how the representatives of the civil democracy are enjoyed: I will not give my opinion."
"I now care about the way we will understand in our programmes," he responded.
As we already heard, the elix Kaucky would not appear to be recognized in the above, that it was the influence of Janousek on the undertakers and friends of the former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to'Kaucky and the only expression he made in the test is "the greatest golf shot in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," he says Kaucky and'e immediately, "I know the journals."
"I'm gonna have to pay a language course," he's glad.
Not only the Karel Brezina killer, but also Lucas Plachy, the elu for the environment, know that the golf stick is the Tunel of Blanco.
The two social-democracy knows who is actually Voldemort and Lucas Plachy knows where to find the personship - he thinks about "Go to the passion".
"I think it's going to a company," Plachy's ready to believe that it's Janousek's company's seat.
At the same time, Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge instead of journals and not of any wording he would use.
According to test candidates, there is no argotic lessons in social democracy.
"I took advice with agees, and it seems that we really don't have something of that kind."
"Instead, the names are sometimes used for abbreviations and symbols," Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, said that members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza in the olive but I don't know if my teachers call me like that, Karel Brezina advised on the surnames.
The Actuel.ch tested the name and it works.
The Weinert Elu is Papy for the members of the Party or at least a friendly little old, the representative of Miroslav Poche, who took attention to him before the elections by the scrokeries during the sponsoring of the party, is referred to as "the small game".
The surnames are also the only one who admits the social-democracy employee within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't love to hear Hulda, but the Akutel.cz quotidien has recorded another surname for this pragios President.
"Doctor in Matraque Right" reminds that Peter Hulinsky has received his title as a doctor in the right of JUDr. to the Braislava police academy.
The Government wants to reduce the torture of "sorcers", has edited a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, the stated female women have common trades.
They are part of the old generation, they cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and do not have children.
The one who becomes "sorcer" is isolated to not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has this destination very rarely."
"We do not even judge young women in good health because they participate in the work and take children," says a sister who cares for the capital of this Western African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the society.
The local government decided to intervene against this "social" measure.
He edited a brochure that should help limit the chat to the stars.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the Day Standard warned about the inconvenience of written education.
The accusation of sorcery is coherent in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with the oil that they had spared him.
This is the BBC server who transmitted this information.
The elders claim that it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil served to ritual onctions was flammed in the contact of the woman.
The oil flammed, it seems, when the team wanted to "bad the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "sorcers" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The Daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year entrepreneur of Burkina Faso: "The human spirit food has always represented a danger," he says.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the chassing to the stars, it was not later than the last year the President himself had seen to participate in it.
"The President Dzammi, after the death of his tissue, launched a wide castle to the stars that, seemingly, would have participated in his death and would be forced by the black magic to kill the President too."
"Calls of Guinea nearly came to the rescue, brought to the presidential closure to Kanilai, under the protection of the police and the personal care of the President, men and women chosen in the villages of the villages of the provinces," indicated the "Amnesty International" in a message.
Closing the prisoners of drinking a potion based on plants for hallucinogene effects that caused more effects on renes and instincts.
Two prisoners haven't survived there.
The international pressure is about a thousand people who were free.
The town of Bakal: The pools chauffing, he signed a higher lower.
An old age came out by the door of the RPG Byty client center of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to praise in Czech Republic.
He took under the arm a dossier with three new location contracts for three apartments: his, his daughter and his son who was going to purify a penalty.
Deregulation has increased the lower to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500, the son will have to arrange from the next year for a 2+1 apartment of the second category 4100 corners.
"And there is no warm water and chauffing works for solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power of signing.
"But I signed whenever," he explains to you in anger and half-signed.
BytyOKD.cz, who described the new location conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises the sites to not sign and wait until 7 December, the date for which a medication will be made to explain the method to follow.
But the man reacts to this by a gesture of hand.
"The one says that, the other says something else" by smoking the mouths.
The region of Ostrava becomes the labour of deregulation.
After the New Year, most of the apartments in Czech Republic whose loans do not correspond to the market price.
Curtualne.ch has decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in the Havirowska street is one of the four of the Ostrava region, and it is already full on Thursday at 09:00 a.m.
Just next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call clients.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is located on the tactile raisan.
One pressure and a paper with a number out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number is already starting on the big ارiran under the top of the waiting room.
In a second fraction, it's your turn.
After an instant, an old couple comes to learn about the lower, but the new lowers do not concern people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to resolve coherent problems, such as everywhere - requesting repairs, events relating to insurance and other.
In the region of Ostrava, more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments have covered the courts with the new bail contracts in their boat to letters since mid November.
RPG Byty offers them increases from 15 to 38 per cent.
The special guichet for new loyers has been opened to the public since 18 November.
"He works for nearly one week, so it is still at the test" answers, after a hesitation instinct, the employee behind the guichet when the client is present as a journalist.
Delegation and ancient Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The President of the Parliament and originating of the region of Ostrava Lubo -- Zaoralek of the social-democratics has been adequately supported before elections, and it now fills the local journals.
"20 years after them, I want a new plank."
"They haven't even changed a powder in the wcs, the mentioned mentioned in introduction.
However, especially, the employees, retraits that come to be sure they will receive a return on the new loan price if they sign now as they promised to RPG in a special offer.
It is a reverse of half of the amount of the loan that the other residents will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" guichet of the Havirovaska street is not really accumulated by the questions.
"For the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to lower," indicates the employee at the guichet.
Yet, RPGs are both on its website and in the vitrines of individual enterprises on the lowers when it is necessary.
If the two parties do not hear on the court, it is an independent court who will take the decision.
"It is not threats but only to inform about the only and unique way of acting," RPG indicates on its website.
"Nobody's going to the court" thinks of one of the RPG Byty employees and the man in the street before the customer center gives him a reason.
"I have 13,000 currencies and I have 5000 corners to eat, I don't have enough to go to the court," he said.
The employee feels suddenly bad.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media requests that no one signs and therefore people wait," she indicates.
The regulation of loans ends in Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, RPG Byty, are economic needs.
"And, in addition, the current lowers still do not reach the level necessary for simply maintenance of the fund for apartments," reminds Paul Klimes, director of the RPG Byty Resident Portfolio, that is just the negativity of the fund for residences that make anger is the main reason for the legendation.
However, between 2005 and 2010, the RPG could invest in 4 billion apartments in the fourth year 2011 to 2014.
The big rubran crossed the floor in front of the refrigerated wallets of the Havirosvka street, however, repeat some of the information indicated in red.
"The rental in 2011 is 15 per cent and is not less than 31200 apartments than 90 per cent of RPG apartments."
"And this will always be at more than 7.50 Czech crowns on m2 per month," indicates the ıran.
38 per cent employment is only 400 apartments of the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase in a very low sum of 19.66 Czech corns at m2," RPG.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause radical but progressive increase between 4 and 8 years.
It makes other commitments: all the money of the lower employment (see the graph) is made to the apartments under the form of chauffing economy - new windows and chauffing.
Those who sign the agreement on the loans have the priority.
The maternal oil is part, and it also includes offices.
The administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new seat of the Arch. Design company.
No one could have expected that it would also open a mini-mature school with everything you need - colour walls, imaginative mobiles, games and finally a area of miniature games on the terrace.
Since October of the last year, children of the Arch. design employees can be made there.
The Arch. Design Arch Arch Arch-architectural project company, whose artists produced a large number of buildings in Brno, imagined his small mother school from the first downwards of the Aviopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age of children, and it is important that women and project heads can quickly return to work.
At the same time as decreased working contracts, the maternal oil is a bonus proposed to its employees by the Arch. Design. in the framework of its social programme.
Constructors and the texts thus have the opportunity to work with care for children.
These are the employees of Arch.Design.theys themselves who imagined this maternal school and with the support of the direction, they could have contributed to the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs.
The mini-mature school is financed by means of the European Social Fund through the operational programme for human resources and the Statual Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding contributions (height of 2.8 billion Czech Czech Courts), they could buy equipment and equipment and after two years provide a qualified staff and the road.
After the use of the financial contribution (two years) the Arch. Design. has the obligation to work after 3 years of the main mother school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project was a year, and this is the Economy rating company who helped to make the request for a dotation.
Children's care is assured by a qualified staff, a whole day and a mother-institute takes care of children. Children can go to the mother-in-law without age limitation, but they have more than three chances for most.
As this is a "master school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but in the day there are more replacements.
The function of the oole is supple; the needs of the parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchic position.
Although it concerns individual care and education, the programme of the primary school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children do not just play, but a quality teaching is also guaranteed there - from the beginning to preparation for the olive are learned.
The class is not only equipped with imaginative games and games but also with a trainer that children can use.
The presence of children in the society grows a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and do not have the stress of a loss to go to search for children in a remote school from the workplace of parents.
Parents therefore use their worktime in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship between employee and employee has been created.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies who offer a choice bonus for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this programme strengthen the marketing of RHs.
The house in the bones is still fascinated after 100 years. Take a look in Gaudi's interior.
The toilet is at the bottom of a prehistoric saurian, the scale to a vertebrale column of dinosaur and the balcones to open fishing bulbs.
This is the house of Casa Battlo in Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received from the locals the surname of Maison in bones.
Organic forms, colors, rock use, road and mosaic fragments, façade recording e·les and everywhere of the courbs, this is all that is yipical for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front of the house draws his dreams, its colors and textures that remind the nature and the animals.
In a more detailed observation, the geometry, the rythme and the precision of thinking are seen.
In the night, the house's façade becomes still more dramatic and is allocated in such a way that the printing of colors is strengthened.
The rubber and torsion of forms also appear inside with the same measure.
The tree copys the window frames, the balustrates, the devastating elements of the doors, the oilton and the lambs.
The Battlo house that stays in the EÂmple quarter in the marketing street Passeig de Gracia at number. 43, was born from the building of a house of the architect Emily Sala Cortes in 1877.
The reconstruction was made for two years and the house ended in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich enterpriseman, insisted on demolition of the old building and building another new, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of a rebuilding and better market.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house for multiple apartments was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is exactly about its project that the decorations for a apartment of representation of the owner of the imagination and the use of the Mosaic for the fascicle.
For the façade, other artists and creators have also worked.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo House's plans began by a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the building of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell park, where there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals renamed the warm house just after its end because of its organic forms "The Maison in bones".
Others, with regard to the specific mechanism of opening windows, called it "the bad house".
On the top of the building, there is a sword similar to the Catalogue patron of Saint Georges.
Other elements of the building have hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought about a single system for the house at his central chauffage time, with events of operation and typical roads.
Their inclination of 45 degrees ≥ bizarre.
During the creation of Gaudi, it was absolutely not respecting the building directives and not allowed it to be involved in them.
At the beginning of the construction, he received from the city the allowance to build, of course, that data on the rebuilding plans were so vague that two years after the end, the municipal Council was threatened and requested amendments.
For example, he did not like the members of the municipal Council that the building piliers were involved in the public trottoir.
There was never a change, but only 15 days after the call of the city of Josep Battlo asked (and gained satisfaction) to loud the two highest stages.
The owner delayed the below stages.
In the gallery at the second stage there was a common room and the third a room and a private part of the apartment.
It was louded for a bathroom.
The entire house of six stages is divided by a scale through which it is reached to an independent towel terrace.
All right angles and right lines were canceled by the basic elements of reconstruction and replacement by corb walls.
Gaudi also worked the modern concept of space connection.
The common party can be linked completely by opening the doors of the rooms and the high company can be comfortable or be limited to the private space for more intimate enterprises.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction has received a non-traditional toilet and two additional stages.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glasses with which the inner heart is covered and with the poets of lights.
The two-color game gives a maximum light in all the stages of the house.
It was just enough to parse the principle that the white reflects more than the shadow that contrary absorbs the sun radians.
The Casa Battlo house, which was registered in 2005 in the World Patrimoine Fund of Unesco, may be visited by each.
At the first stage of the house, the most spacious and greatest apartment is accessible to the public.
The owners decided to break this step in 2002 at the 150th anniversary of the famous Creator's birthday.
They continued visits because they discovered that it was a lucrative company, and they expanded the field of visits to common spaces and the border, including towel terraces.
The input billet in the monument is actually not sweet and costs 16.50 euros; students, retraits, groups and turistic card holders have 20 percent of rabai.
The sum is even above the income price in the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the image and visit the house.
How to choose a math and a summary: Women have other criteria than men.
No spectacular frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved at bed, so mathematic and summier gives a real basis for a good bed.
They must, of course, comply harmoniously to please a concrete user.
The choice of many things is determining: weight, size, age, health status and owner sex.
The type of inside in which we are going to place the math and the summary is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the campaign's house where the latex matelas are not permanently suitable because they "return" duly.
They have, above, a weight greater than the standards of polyurethane.
It is often necessary to return them.
If they don't have enough ventilation channels in the heart, and they remain on a solid level, they keep humidity.
The habit is so determining in the choice.
Whoever passes the time in the foreign, where we often use very space mathematics with a rashing box, will feel hard on a low and hard surface.
"This is how all hokeyists who come back from NHL grieve that they can't sleep there."
"For their fatigue, feet and coasts, they needed mathematics with a rash-speaking mouse cup."
"There are also recommended for people who suffer diabetes who have a problem with the nervous system that, therefore, do bad "informations" of articulations and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in the removaled mobiles.
That's why a few years ago, the mathematics with a parseous mouse conquered hokeyists and other customers.
"Auourd today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Tropico Czech have suitable maths.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a poor mouse.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape itself the absorbed heat or well adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing presses you and you will not return in the night as after a difficult match.
You just sleep better.
The parse muscle also works as a protection against squares.
For the choice of the mathematics according to your size, take the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
So a man and a woman with a size of 180 cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each one for a bed of two places should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For beds at one place, for example, singles are recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's comfortable in case of visit.
However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are sleeping on your back, you should put your hands comfortablely with the cousins fully brown. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Matelassiers and decorators who have been dedicated to the problems of a healthy dream and the engineering of the mobile and teacher in specialized schools.
For a bed at two places everyone needs his own summary and math, so attention while buying a good choice of the height of the mathematics.
Otherwise, you will only remain to mount the summary at different heights and it is not performable on all sides of bed.
Mouse mathematics should have a minimum height of 14 cm, at least 15 cm residual mathematics, of which for the form and operational shadow of at least three metrometers.
"At touching or sitting in position on the math you don't have to feel the resorts," Héléna Prokopova predicts.
Each killer asks a well-determined type of summier.
The bed-some, when the math and the summer are united as our sisters, there is nothing to do in the rooms to sleep.
The mathematics were very bad; we do not have to laugh it, which is doing quietly today.
And since during the night we are normally transpired from 0.2 to 0.75 l sugar it is that after 5/7 years, the math starts to remember a big (and murdered) too.
For this reason, experts are making a claim on a 25-year-old life duration for a mathematic or a life-life guarantee.
But it's all about it.
And for this, an experience advice from the sellers: for a 120/140cm mathematical, refuse, for mathematical clothing, hygiene or lavage, but rather hold a protective math that you can easily get back and laugh.
And even though in our days it is often to manufacture closure closure for all the enemy, it is that after the opening we have two parties (for the lavage and size of the machine to lave it is very important!) but the manipulation for the large models (and for one person) becomes when weighing them between a weight and a weight weight on a ring.
Do you have a strict plane in your bed instead of a summary?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night.
However, equip the plane (if there is no) of aeronaut and use the resort mathematics with a minimum height of 15cm with satches (of German Taschenfederken) and an aeroplane box.
A polyuretan math must not be part of this type's bed.
For lakes with a single position of 14/18 lams, latex maths or sandwichs (possibly the combination of latex and coco noise) are the idea, but it will always be better for you to have a mathematic with more lame, 28 and above, where the lambs are doubled in the bottom of the renes and that it is so possible to regulate the rigidity.
For multiple position mathematics, it doesn't need to take resort maths because it doesn't respond to position changes.
Besides the regulation of the rigidity of the lambs, it is also possible to do what is called a beach.
It's a special link to the lambs that allows even to press the lamb to move the lamb to the "sheeping" epoch.
For men who have "the rocks as large as the back", it is really a important thing.
This is already considered by mathematical manufacturers who for "maculins" have started to use a ranging area at the level of the stones.
But they also think about women - they offer them a more molecular surface at the level of the hanches.
For the most difficult customer, there are summers of ail or plastic with what it is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure is diminished in more points and refuses the pressure.
But, of course, attention, since you use a bad oreiler (great and gonfly air) on good mathematics and summers, the "mother" was disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple rock: the rock must support the head and its points must only reach the rocks so that the muscles of the rocks can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinaves prefer.
When it is extended on the side, the oreiller must update (with the beach of the summer or the rammo area in the mathematics) the height of the scrolls.
Modern mathematics have something more common with the first based pail and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or many mixtures.
The trend is also in biomates.
The primary materials based on oil, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oil, such as soja oil.
Almost all manufacturers using soja.
"The Bio Quality for Materies means that the heart is manufactured based on natural products," explains Peter vasicek of the Tropico Plus company.
Natural materials are also used for mathematical clothing; one of the first was the pure alpha.
But you can have microcapsules that develop parfs of the forest or of the forest.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of bottle plants to absorb the calor and refresh the body, "refrigerate" the man, the clothes "cough" women.
The outside of red powder accelerates the blood behaviour and is therefore warmer for weak sex.
The current preferences?
The mathematics produced from cold mouse (he has more pores with a cellular structure disturbed more respiratory than the standard polyuretan and has more elasticity.
The combination of different frozen mouse rigidities gives polyzone matures that know exactly where the head is, the bottom of the leg and the foot.
You're paying a quality maturity from 7000 corners and more.
Those who are characterised by their health parameters are less than TVA and are taken as health tools.
In Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached the first place.
Economy for mathematics and summer is not simple.
In time, in the context of special actions of manufacturers or two manufacturers can be given for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex company offers Duofre matelas with memory mouse Mem ́ cooking for 11990 coroners.
Obviously, the second can be taken freely.
The ear of pearsed or viscoelastic muscles with a open cell structure and a large spacing has been started with the material Time with a "cosmic rythme".
This started as a material for NASA because the astronautes were on the start of large load factors.
The Temporary goes to the calor, and it washs, in contrast, in cold.
So he perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes a optimal pressure to him.
It is ideal for this against evil sleep and for a growing comfort during sleep.
Viscoelet muscles are not only used for mathematics but also for health products, such as special couchs for feet that highlight the feet and the wine system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use the EucathermC or Twinsaver mouse or the same type.
The devices to follow people are more requested by parents who want to watch their children.
The fear of their child has brought more people to think of watching them through a GPS.
The system, placed at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to track people's movement and help for some cases such as the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a bottle of aluminium but will soon be the size of an hour.
The case of the little Anicka was a lot of people and they began to look for ways to protect their children better.
Even if the price is to trouble their private life.
"We are trying to say to everyone that it is not a spinner but only a way to reduce the probability that there is another tragedy," Peter Pilin of the MAcro Weil company, who is one of the trace equipment suppliers on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of bad employment of such devices, for example put it into the sack of a person who is not in the town, but I have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, Mr. Pilin.
It says that children should always know for what purposes "boot" is used and how to use it in case of emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, takes attention that if the child doesn't want to bring something of this type on him, he's going to lose it.
"And even the smallests can show a great creativity when it is to be exhausted from something when they do not want to be under control."
"Portable phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
It states that the fact that this type of apparatus can help in case of agression is very discussable.
"If this is a prepared rapt, the author will do everything so that the child doesn't have a electronic device that can locate it."
"Instead, it's the phone."
"When the tracking equipment will be developed, they will also search for them because the sale will be supported by a publicity campaign."
"In such cases, the police will always be in progress," said the psychologist.
It accepts the same as such apparatus can help in an agression not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring Society, which proposes trace services both for cars and for people, states that having this type of apparatus can help, even if it is destroyed in case of agression.
"The apparatus can be parametered in such a way that it may be regularly issued after a specified period."
"In the case where the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
"The lovers apparatus also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and seemed in a long position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, smart smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after it has been formatted with a special prological.
The problem of the current tracking systems is that it is an apparatus similar to those of the size of a aluminium bottle or the smallest phone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to the Macro Weil Company Pilina, it is why tests are currently conducted to make apparatus that represent common digital hours.
"This will have the benefit that the eventual agressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"And he will take account after a certain time, which will have given the police a little more time," he said.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of bracelet or rubber, it will always use the same as to track cars.
It is a combination of acquiring systems using a GPS position (which is used coverly in autonavigation) and a mobile phone function that warns the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonators that she could turn the Czech Republic with, but she can only hold two years.
The army bought for 445 km of rains used for explosives.
Last year, the Defence Minister had bought it 224 km.
The army has therefore reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the duration of life of the branches is between two and four years of maximum.
The army bought detonators to the anonymous STV Group company for 40 million coronas.
The general major state has given as a result of the acquisition of a large quantity of detonators in MF DNES that soldiers use them 60 km per year.
According to the reservation calculations made by the pyrotechnicians of the army, which MF DNES has contacted, it is evident that even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or employees should have an exercise for explosives each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Defense Minister and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the Army, does not make exception.
Only to argument the annual consumption of the army of 60 km detonators.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the reservations of the army could be overcome for 10 years.
If, in contrast, it would be true that for the basis of each of the new professionals, it is sufficient for more than 2 m detonators, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has assured - including the consumption of special units and genius - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the Quick Intervention Brigadier recently claimed to Minister Vondra that they had almost no munitions for their poing weapons and that the travel sessions were limited because of money needs.
About the lack of body linge we don't talk about it.
"And I don't take my head if they buy us so much detonators."
"And that's their decision, and they really know what they do."
"For us, the army is a good customer we strive as trademakers to satisfy," says the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, portfolio of the Defence Minister, arguments the purchase of hundreds of miles of detonators by the fact that the army will have these "munities" for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group has only four years of life of detonators and police and military pyrotechnics.
"If they are perfectly involved in the deposits, it can go even to four years," said one two who doesn't want his name to be taken into account of the criticism of the army.
The past lifetime, each munition must be tested to see whether it remains inevitable and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and cost money.
The second argument of the Minister is a rabai due to the amount of 445 km detonators.
"They costed us 60 per cent less than the delivery of the last year of 245 km," indicates the Pejsek portfolio, which has been interpreted by the opinion of the Defence Ministers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonators of the police pirotechnicians who neutralize the municipalities of the Second World War or those after the Soviet Army is not exceeding 1500 meters.
And the police always commands only the amount of munitions necessary to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for the safety reasons of the pyrotechnics and for more power of the types of more modern and more reliable detonators.
The Defence Minister today has great problems for the neutralization of tens of tonnes of munitions from the time of Varsovia when the strong Checoslovakian army of two hundred thousand men was prepared to move, head of the Rhin.
What is expected in a few years of this Czech Army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralizing hundreds of miles of detonators of old rains that she bought today "in good market".
To this day, I have benefited from contacts that I have received thanks to the concours.
The sale under his hotel's franchise helped Luke Pytloun to win the concurrence of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the concours of the best individual undertaking for the past year was Lucas Pytloun, 28-year-old undertaking.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Luke Pytloun was a traveler.
And in the foreign, he realized that in Liberia there was no quality residence site at a reasonable price.
From his economy on what he had won when he worked in the foreign and with the help of a loan, he bought a little little of five apartments to half demoly.
As he knew that he was still studying in the threeth year of higher studies, it was a courageous action.
"The report between the quality and the price of an apartment in our region has made me want to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began to praise the first rebuilt apartment to the strangers.
He re-invests the benefit in the content that he transformed into pension with 54 beds.
Since that moment, his undertaking action allowed him to open 4 pensions in Liberec, two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of approximately 300 beds of all categories of apartment.
The most comfortable of them was too recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year he had another identical quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates to the Pytloun hotels' franchise," the number 1 of entertainers in the past year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the execution of a large-scale hotel, the victory to the concurrence of the undertaking was well used, Pytloun with respect.
The victory brought him more popularity and known to Liberia and its surroundings.
"The people had me in the streets, often welcomed me, and I must say that it was very pleasant," he recalls.
He recommends participating in this concours to all who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be → is good.
He says that he uses its contacts and knowledge until today that he couldn't be able in another way.
"I began regularly maintaining commercial relations with those I met by concours.
It states that the renamed success has also been affected by employees.
And he had about 70.
"I watch with them especially the loyalty and proudness of being involved in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, and far away, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us.
"Only my name is moved before," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I want my follower a better year than what we had in Farmet.
The effort of the victory was replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind himself.
He who came to look for the price in Slovansky dum for the first place of the concours for the Vodaphone firm last year is Karel Zdarsky's owner of the Farmet company.
The jury repeated the efforts with which he transformed an outdoor in Ceska Skalice to a firm of 100 million currencies.
'I can say that the resistance has not only encouraged me to my owners and increased our confidence in themselves to fight competition," says the winner of the concours of the last year.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet society there was the desire to do something useful.
And thus, when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to praise the small wedding as compensation after the confiscation of goods by the staff, he didn't have a long time, he had a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some friends around his father for the manufacture of plastic bathrooms.
Not very long after they began to specialize themselves in the pressures for vegetal oil.
It became the largest manufacturer of automatic pressures in Central Europe after eight years.
The company was even known in the non-specialized public after the success of the concours through media.
"Not only our customers began to really better know the pharmaceutical mark but also the foreign partners who began to realize that they were with a company that had achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," Karel Zdarsky said.
But the past year wasn't going to Farmet just in the euphory of the victory.
The company's assessment was made from the economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the highest of the crisis, which did not really touch citizens, the companies were obligated to stop their investment projects and to begin to limit their purchases of new mothers and mothers.
"We have not clearly escaped the situation."
"The business numbers have fallen from 40 percent, and we should have limited our production and even license," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A sustainable company must know that timely measures should be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained beneficial results even if they were lower than those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built a training and research center with the funds, strengthened the presentation of the company in international exhibitions rooms and gained the main resources in national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
Everything allows us to think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of employees are also increasing in the number of employees.
"A new winner I want this pleasant sense of victory but in a quiet atmosphere," Karel Zdarsky said.
The request that removes injured rules.
The question on the Absurdity of the year is for the fourth time a part of the case clan.
Certain absurd regulations could be deleted.
The little glorious winner of this year of the year's Absurdity Question was the obligation to bring to the offices of the documents that officers could be online.
More than 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, the administration of social matters requested an extrait paper from the trade register, while the officer could be in two mouse clicks.
It changes through the question.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for the extent of the trade register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, the CSSZ Czech Social Insurance Administration's password.
To highlight all regulations and decrees that companies and undertakers must fill in Czech Republic and remove those who are absurd is the sense of this concurrence of the year's Absurdity.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has a greater popularity.
If the last year 3000 voters have been manifested, it is at least 4000 that have voted.
And it's not surprising, there are the most different obligations in our country that only make the business free, and, in addition, more.
"We may be in the number of documents to comply with tax statements on the first places in the world," Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Mediterranean companies and undertakers of the Czech Republic said.
The simplification of enterprise activities becomes a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, the entire situation in Czech Republic does not improve.
According to the world bank, the Czech Republic is at the 74st place for the conditions for the company, or 8 places more than the last year.
The concurrence of the Absurdity of the year was placed for the first time in 2006 and continued the same scenario each year.
Anyone who can state the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last time before the concurrence is closed.
To account the web site www.firmaroku.cz, then, the concurrence manager chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and allows the public to vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the largest number of votes is declared winner.
To the last investigation of the last year, it is a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decretes that have lost their sense of existence.
Notes are sent by undertakers, but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the concurrence, therefore, among the nameds, it is the obligation that auto-containing vehicles and fast roads pay pigs, or although twenty-employed undertakers repeal two offices and two toilets each two years.
the list of the seven proposals is listed on the concurrence site.
The publication of the concours, which always begins at the beginning of November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a event which regularly participates in political and political personalities.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for small and medium-sized enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Czech Republic of Commerce Chamber, attended at the time of concurrence.
"The economic prosperity can not work when the State puts cattle in the enterprises' feet, and for this purpose I intend to remove at least three tenths of paragraphs that make the business to be complied today," said Martin Kocourek, the Ministry of Industrie and Commerce.
The effort to remove absurd decretes is not a sword shot in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasing for people was the obligation of enterprises to say three days before the office for the individual undertaking in the place where the company is, the purpose of going to an exhibition or a penalty with a stand.
This obligation was deleted with the amendment of the Law on the individual undertaking.
The second most plebiscited obligation in 2007, which was to say to the Agency a service journey for a foreign employee for 30 days, was deleted with the Law text on what the Green Card is called.
And it's all right until the third session of the concours.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapeuts of having a big mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year the obligation to have a refrigerator has been deleted.
A new category repeateds the socially responsible firms.
Assessed are the ological, humanitarian, training, or even sports projects.
The newness of this year of Hospodarske Noviny Concours, which already exists for 5 years, is the category called the 2010 Responsible Company.
The enemy of this concurrence is the support for the reasonable and just company.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's impact on the environment and conduct socially responsible activities," indicates Patrick Bartholdy, the regional phone operator's manager, Vodaphone, which is the guarantee and promotor of this concours, as in the case of concurrence for the rebellion of the year.
For this first year of this subcategorie of the 2010 firm's concours, organized by the Vodaphone firm, have been registered by companies that have not succeeded with one long-term objective for the company.
The aventure of each of them is rich of inspirations and an independent article would be to edit.
Although their business object is different from one of the other, their support and prevision activities can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, this concerns handicaped persons and personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic, there are no examples of Prague Prologicial Society and Netera who support the creation of informal sport teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tournois in various sports disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company who is 17 years ago the main contribution to the dotation fund that sponsorates the childhood.
In order to take care of health problems, it is still possible to cite the old Paper manufacturing company of Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent, which, for this reason, has received the title of the Company Responsible for the Central Bohemia Region and which has been the third in the region in the Concourses of the Year’s Agency organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomo; it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has won for the introduction of suspected working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week and, without, proportionally, loan reduction.
The jury also devoted her title because she purchased the Czech manufacturers in priority, supported a ditoyen activity in the nearby environment and cared about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as far as possible so that our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the ex-effective leadership of the company.
the IT Enlogit of the Usti region also thinks about the health of its employees and has made them for each mobile holder a box and a keyboard, encourages their homework and uses the catering services of a local protected company for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Rome community," Ondrej Suchy said the representative of the society.
In the last range, a Lavage and cleaning company of Karlovy Vary's region is also available, which participates in the retraite assurance of its employees in the form of bonus above standards.
"In our society, we contribute to food, transport, qualifications and pleasure," Joseph Strapac said of the Czasch Bruntal Construction Society, winner for the region of Moravia-Silesia.
They were automatically recorded in the Company Responsible Category, all regional finalists for the Concurrence of the Vodaphone Company, who had answered the questionnaires in a share of the registration document and sent it to the holder before 15th a.m.
The wrong-filled or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the concurrent.
"If the representatives of the school firms did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company's Company's Company, but were not disqualified by the "principal" concours of Vodaphone's year."
"Independent inscriptions are not possible because it is a subcategorie of the main concurrence of the Year firm," explains Karel Goldman of the organizational Agency Bison&Rose.
In the Plzen Earth Fund, the police had been arrested during a public concours
In the building of the Plzen Earth Fund, the anti-corruption police has been arrested in recent days.
The detectives passed the mines to the local undertaking and traded in the inmobility of Lubos. G.
It was attempted to manipulate just a call for public offers for the regulation of a refund request so that the proposed territory is obtained by a determined candidate.
He had to pay to Lubos G. a half million coroners.
"For the instant, I can only confirm that the police continues a person for initial crime in the framework of a call for an offer and a public concour." said for the Reno journal the head of the Plzen Antonie Zelena Park, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more explanations because the request is on.
After 24 hours, the police officer was free of 46 years.
To know how he could influence a public concours, it can only be able to spend a few official information.
In a question of Righto, the Portfolio of the Lubomira Cerna Territory Fund indicated that the police had actually been arrested in Plzen on a separate workplace and, during the public concurrence.
"He acted with a customer, and in no case a employee, he said.
The public concours · Cerna has the true name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of landspapers" and is placed when several benefiting candidates are shown.
"These people propose, in the framework of the call, a higher value of their rights to residences which must be regulated before the country's value has been registered."
"The rights proposed by the acquisitor's classification are placed and the Area Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's portfolio.
Lubos G. had, it was, it was, the information about persons who were registered in the call and as he himself, a benefitful person because he had bought a large number of refund rights, he had proposed the candidates in the country to not participate in the concurrence.
And he suddenly was involved by the fact that he went back.
What would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpelling.
Lubos G. had broadly contacts above the standards in the FdT (Fonds of Territories).
It was in the case of FdT Vaclav Sankot's ex-chef, who was continued to the penalty to have edited areas for which the decision to establish a construction was already published.
Just Lubos G. had, for example, obtained areas for the building of communications, particularly in place and place where the access art had to be built to the industrial area of Borske Pole.
Later he exchanged it with the mairi for a building in the history center of the city whose value is far higher.
The mairi was obliged to accept because otherwise it was able to put the building in danger by blocking the lands.
The households will pay an addition of a hundred cents of coronas monthly for the apartment.
The households will have to pay an addition from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sugar, chain supply and in some places the lowers will also increase.
The families will therefore have to take from their port-monae to a hundred cent per month more than now from January.
Electority increases 4.6 percent, nearly 2 percent lower gas, in certain locations you must pay up to a decade more water supply and in many places the central chauffing supply will be also lower.
The election of the household should be used for households in apartment of 100 corners annually more than currently.
However, all providers have reduced election prices because it is the sensitive development to promote the production of renewable energy, including photos.
The gas increases moderately but, of course, at the time that people need it most to chauffure and thus have the greatest consumption.
It is therefore possible to calculate a hundred more coronas.
Although election and gas increase in the whole Czech Republic, the change in the price of central chauffage is different from town in town.
These are mainly the biggest communities that plan the price ratification.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce pay from January for the central chain nearly 50 hours per month, Libéric families pay more than 1000 hours annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague, a increase of 9 per cent is prepared for water and water pollution for the case in which the city increases infrastructure lowers.
If the lowers don't change the pleasure, they pay a addition of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be part of the lowest comparison with the whole country.
In the North Boheme, where the prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation increases by 7.4 percent.
The lower prices will, for example, increase sensitively in the 450 thousand apartments in location from January to the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company with Usti na Labem nearly 2500 apartments decided to increase up to 100 per cent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase of laws will be translated before the courts by the company.
The regular loans paying people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase in the next year of 10 per cent.
The Czech Children go to the rhum and the fernet. The beer is no longer mode and acts doodly.
The fernet, the rhum, the wodka and in exceptional way also the best whisky mark is stolen to parents.
It's drinks that are most often leading to those who are sooling, who are not yet fifty years, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are addressed to the hospital for recidives do not make the exception.
This results of the experience of doctors who face cases similar to the admission of children's hospital departments.
"Births or wine are no more mode because it needs time to be saoul."
'The trend is actually to strong alcohols,' indicates the Righto Ludek Pel, Chief of the Hospital Department of Horo in Central Boheme.
"When they succeeded to chip a papa bottle in the arm, it's sometimes whisky but it's the fernet and the wodka that's overwhelming.
"The wodka has this benefit that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus do not feel it," explains the Department Boss.
Eva Jurinova, port-word of the Motol Hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's the rhum or the fernet."
"This is today the alcohol in the mode, especially in the elementary schools."
"In some cases, he acted with slivo; they returned from the house," Jurinova.
According to the Department Chair of Pélikan, see children of 13 to 40 years of age to hospital admissions is a normal phenomena.
Before working in Horo -- since last year, he was in Motol, where he exercised ten years just in pediatry, where ambulances brought students of the large surroundings completely drinking.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"He started her career at twelve years when it was brought with 3.5 for a thousand alcohol in the blood with a mix with extasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"He was at the Holeso Expositions Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that his daughter is 48 hours away," said the Department's officer.
It is exactly the disinterestation of parents or their tolerance outside the community because their refuses are the principal cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to the experts, however, we do not speak of the strict dependence for children.
"On the alcoholic vocabulary we hear a chronic dependency on alcohol for several years with all the phenoways that cover it, but that we don't find in children."
"When those who use the recurrence acool, it is not a social-family background significantly defavorable," explained the Department Department Pélikan.
According to the Jurinova portfolio, about 40 wine children have been hospitalized this year until mid November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
The statistics are included only in cases with an incidence in the need for hospitalization.
The drinking children who are after emergency care returned to them by parents or police are not counted.
Besides the cases of children who are sitting and drinking a alcohol bottle after the olive, he exhibits the Pélikan three seasonary waves with which we can count: the day of shoes, the Holy Silvestre and the end of the school year.
"If they drink, despite bad results, or in contrast, they celebrate the beginning of vacations."
"Surely I saw a admission of 7 drink children on the day of the stars once," Pélikan highlighted.
The beer kid who passed the night to the hospital in desintoxation under medical control is paradoxally in a better position than the one who comes to him and suffers the next day of the "tree bullet".
The heads of the morning caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by infusion of glucose and nutritional elements of the need.
"They are better lotis because they pass a great night then a sweet wake up and nothing makes them bad."
"They're just surprised of the place where they are," Pélikan knows that it's a timely time that it takes the good humor of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go to tens of thousands of coroners.
"In time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drinks have been costed and that they could pass the whole seasonary late to restore one evening," Pélikan said.
However, he, health insurance companies in their regression management, which should be recovered by parents with care, do not treat the cases of drinking children.
Two aircraft L-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five aircrafts L-159, against which the Defence Minister has changed transport aircrafts Casa C-295M, found on Monday for Seville in Spain where the airport manufacturer is sitting in Casa-EADS.
This is the first time that the devices of this type become the property of someone other than the Czech Army.
However, they have been in the foreign in the field of exercises or demonstration flights.
It is biplastic versions of L-159T1 which were still in service in the Czech Army and who were in a flight state.
Restant apparatus are monoplas versions of L-159.
These are stated for the instinct at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial mediator - Omnipol firm - took into account them last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Department of Presidency of Defense, Vodochody's airport is for the unknown.
'L-159 aircrafts for exchange have been taken on aircrafts stored for long ago without providing additional charges or investments for the Defence Minister.'
"The L-159 T1 biplaces have been changed in the state," he said for Righto Pejsek.
He concluded that the army would not remain without biplace because the Minister signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody a agreement of a value of 200 million coroners for the transformation of four monoplas L-159 in two biplas.
The army took delivery from the first apparatus in July, and the second was planned for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it was committed to introduce aircraft in the equipment of some countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract, it is stated that he who takes account of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will serve for the introduction of NATO's pilots."
"It is therefore the case of one who takes into account how to do this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, a while ago, that the Spanish Army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion coronas was entered last year by the Government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Defence Minister has not launched a call for offers and directly contacted EADS.
the defence direction insisted while the exchange ensures a future export from L-159 to the foreign.
The Czech Army purchased 72 equipment in Aéro Vodochody and only uses 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The buying of aeroplanes Casa will probably have Jewish implications.
However, the European Commission claimed against the Czech Defence Minister to the European Court because the aircraft should be chosen in the framework of a European scale calling for offers and in no case contacting directly a manufacturer.
The army has already taken a delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last should come on the Prague Kbely airport within two weeks.
A longer index than the canceller is a low risk sign of cancer
Men who have the longer index than the cancellation are exposed to a less risk of having a prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a Wednesday study by the British Cancer magazine.
This can depend on the level of the hormone meat the testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the fingerprint is a simple test of cancer cancer of prostate, especially for men before 60 years," stated the student of the Rose Eeles study, professor of the Institute for Research on Cancer at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help to determine what men should be subject to the test of the prostat cancer, in particular by combining with the genetic risk or other aggressive factors such as family health anticipations, has eelees.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her clusters in Greece more than 1500 patients with a prostate cancer and at the same time approximately three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the canceller.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of a cancer of prostate.
However, in the case of those who had the longer index than the cancellation, the risk was fallen to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The length report of the two citizens - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, in particular, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the outerus.
Unless testosteron corresponds to a longer index.
Research has shown that it is just the testosteron that helps the development of a prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Holdes, Czech Genetic renamed and ancient President of the Scientific Academy, said for CTK that he is at the core of this study but that he does not, it seems, that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the authors D1 and D5 are closed.
Czechland as most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On the roads and trottoirs, most of the time of the compact snow, the dealers worked all night in many places.
The D5 is closed the morning between the 89th and the 9th miles in the direction of Rozvadov due to several trucks and car accidents and D1 to Brno in the direction of Prague is the same.
The division of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) said to the information
At the 91st miles a truck was accidental, at the 93th two weights of worst weight, it was hurt.
Several cars have also been found in the footnote.
The problems are also on the area D1 to 185 miles in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks have been trapped there.
The drivers should go straight after Brno at 190 miles or go through Brno and then enter the 182 km to Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several miles has been formed in this place.
Moreover, on D11, there is an accident and, just in the air that is in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow bowl of a number of metros of snow, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car rows are created in Prosek, the Sterboholska street is also buried.
The safe transport means is the metro.
The tramways, for example, take the rest on the line between the Place Charles (Karlove Neisti) and the Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight hours a morning, the most crisis state in Prague must still be gathered.
Railways and airport also face problems.
Czech railways have already had to be removed due to snow 7 fast legs.
Lines for example from Prague in Kralupy or many of Prague in Beroun have problems
Travelers should control the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed from Friday 11h00 in the night to 5 hours of the morning.
Most of the roads in the South Moravia are already rollable but by double watch.
On the way of Vyskov, three side roads are impraticable, on the road of Brno he begins to have places of snow rafales and on the road of Blansko the chains are obligatory to pass some ways of communication in the higher places.
The region of Vyskov was part of the most touched places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Mileso
To clean them, maybe you'll have to send snow-friends and snow-freshes.
We can't appreciate the instinct when they'll be rollable.
On the Road of Hodonin, it is rigorous in the white Carpathes region.
On the roads that, in view of the protection of nature, only undertaken by the aspersion of inherent products, there is even a 5-meter snow snow CTK warning.
In Czechland, it fell between two and 10 meters of snow; it fell the most in the North Boheme, with often up to 18 meters of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, it fell up to 15 meters of snow.
The injury was gradually disappeared in Czechland.
Americans have a new "intelligent arm"
The American army sent a new "intelligent" weapons to Afghanistan only known under the XM-25 code.
The generals think that this new automatic fusil will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and "switch the game" to their benefit.
The new weapons are like a super precise canon
His projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few metres.
Specific 25 mm calibra munitions developed for this fusil and containing a highly brushing explosive functions in fact as small greys.
We can program munitions in such a way that they will explode in the contact of the target, but to any point of their balistic trajectory.
So it can be used against an enemy who is hidden behind an obstacle, a wall or a foot.
It is not even protected from above, and when it falls on a murdered rain of ace, it can also make it out of fighting.
According to Richard Audette who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new fusil is the first infantary weapon that uses the "intelligence".
"The soldier uses it primarily as it finds the target, sends him a laser ray that determines the distance, thus gets a specific point of view, which he corrects his given site and supports the detention.
"Let's say you've got 543 meters."
"When you press the detention, the weapons are loaded and shoot at the distance of 543 metres more or less than 1,2,3 metres, it stated Audette.
400 delocalized jobs
The Fujitsu group deployes his Bad Homburg branch to Francfort.
The next year, in July, 400 persons will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, currently located in the placing of offices of the Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese Fujitsu group delocates his summer of Bad Homburg in Francfort.
As Wednesday the specialised gentleman in the manufacturing and maintenance of computers, the next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, currently on the place of Marienbader from the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a large complex of offices held on the street of Lyoner Street of the Quartier Niederrad de Francfort.
A portfolio of Fujitsu explained that the group should averagely group 100 other jobs in the region.
Location offer was extremely attractive. Moreover, Astro Park's open air offices are better covered with the working mode of workers.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu was just local.
The Director-General, Bernd Wagner, said, "Frankfurt-Nederrad is a primary movement for us with a notable infrastructure."
He claims that the connection to the airport is just a major importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new starting of an important enterprise within the region led to the joy of winners yesterday and caused the deception of the perceptions.
The responsibility for the economic business of the municipality of Francfort, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), stated that a "planetarian actor" had been so conquised.
It is a "extraordinary faith professional in the place of implantation".
Fujitsu corresponds to the city and its implantation is an important elan for Niederrad.
The Major of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the green) regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction has soon informed the municipality of this purpose.
"He will without saying that we have proposed our aid to this company," Mr. Korwisi said.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer against the owner of the placing of the Place Marienbader.
Finally, the economic reasons would have been determining.
It is now to avoid that such a exceptional place remains unemployed for a long time.
"I have the hope that the owner and the worst of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the content of the Place of the Hotel de Ville, used by the Fujitsu company and the "vertical" neighborhood, and the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the construction project in the thermal station.
The fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new income from the city was created between the gare and the city Hotel, which causes many criticisms, not only because of the impressive acceleration of surfaces that are sometimes part of the parking, but also because of the height of the immobiles.
In 2001, the investment and advice company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, manufacturers of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, was recorded in immortals.
In 2006, the German Francfort Specialized Inmobilian-Chancen Group purchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as Morgan Stanley's immobiliary funds. A year later, these buildings were returned to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group whose seat is in Tokyo is considered the third largest provider of information products in the world.
For example, it provides computers and servers for businesses and also provides the essential service.
The Rhin-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu is certainly more employment in Munich.
The Summer, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to install in Frankfurt-Nederrad. The other branches presented in this site are Fujitsu Services and a TDS company.
For this, 7000 square meters have been located in the Astro Park.
This old complex of twenty years, whose name reminds his plan as a star, opens the seat of the Conference of the Electrotechnical and Electrotechnical Industrie.
Server Expulsion by Amazon - threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks proves more and more difficulties.
The Internet Service Provider Amazon expelled the specialized site from his servers in the revelation of confidential documents.
This attitude may be hidden by political pressures after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, appears to live in letters.
In the United States, Wikileaks site is always more forced.
The Wikileaks cyber-activist group has no more access to his home server in America and now seeks a hotel in Europe.
During this time, the American Eminent Senator, Joe Lieberman, called the other countries and companies to boycotter Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is searched by Interpol, probably lives in the Great-Bretagne, and the information provided by journals.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freety of expressions in the country of freedom" indicated Wednesday (local time) cyber-activists in the origin of revelations through the Twitter social network.
Recently before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists have been assigned to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the largest number of documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues to reveal: "Formidable, our dollars are now expensed to take care of people in Europe."
When the freedom of expression has a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television chain, quoting Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks to use his servers after the request carried out by Senator Joe Lieberman.
The President of the Senat Committee on Territory Protection had threatened the Amazon site to organise a boycott at his meeting, reported the British Journal The Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to take this measure before as regards the publications of the classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Similarly, Mr. Liebermann called the other countries to use the servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and without scrupules, and it makes our national security in danger and danger of life throughout the world," an independent senator.
"A conscientious undertaking of its responsibility, whether or not American or foreign, should not help Wikileaks spread the contents of furnished documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is searched by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of violation, is listed on the list of persons searched by Interpol.
According to information distributed by the London "The Independent", Australia of 39 years lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is.
Cyber-activist has continued to qualify for an orchestrated enterprise by its detractors the consequences committed by Sweden.
The Wikileaks portfolio, Christinn Hrafnsson, said to London that threats have been pronounced against the site.
"Calls were even made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly afraid of his security, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the Wikileaks' founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was manifestly responsible for the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the responsible for the revelations made by Wikileaks continue and exempted for trade.
In Canada, the Governing Boss of Stephen Harper said to the television, evidently ironicly, that Mr. Assange should be killed and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
At that time, a polymetic was declined between the White Maison and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, portfolio of the American President Barack Obama, qualified of "ridicule and absurd" the fact that Mr. Asange requested the demission of the State Secretary of Hilary Clinton if this was responsible for the order given to the diplomates, and has recently declared to be delivered to spiral activities.
"I don't know exactly why we should take care of the opinion of a owner of a website," says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the statements of a website."
The American Government now has completely been testing the protection of its databases.
According to a white House, Mr. Travers, adjoint Director of the Centre of Anti-Terrorism, was appointed responsible for combating refugees.
Mr. Travers is charged to place "the necessary reforms" necessary after the divulgation of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White Maison also wants to verify the means that the whole administration exchanges and protects information.
Furthermore, the American Government announced that he wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and military people if they had ever been threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have done everything to contact them" indicated the portfolio of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The University of Glace
At the "Gelato University" of Bologne, ice confishers are prepared for the best season of the year.
The three-day starting course organized for the future islanders has been very successful and attired from visitors coming from everyone.
In fact, where's the whole ice coming from?
Du Glacier and ice machine.
The ice, which is in German, is a little demoded ice confissor, produces the creme and all the rules of the Italian ice art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated vitrine using a spatule, it is available in the left and then starts to sell it.
To know that, we do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologne.
But whoever wants to learn more about ice, can't avoid "Jelato-University" from the Italian Carpigiani firm.
The sorbeer manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice cremes from its machines respond to high Italian ideals.
The three-day starting course organized for the future iceers has been very successful and attracted from visitors coming around the world.
They are also offered special courses on chocolate ice and have been held in several days. The same is the practical sessions organized in the private glace.
In the full crisis of the quarantine, a number of people dream of a new career, Others are simply risked to carry out their burning desire on the ice island.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia by Hungary.
Jacky, artistic education teacher coming from California, is led to Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European quality product in the country of the Industrial Glass in the future.
Anke de Berlin is advised in business management, and she wants, after a few years, to take some of the exhaustion of this trial for the nerfs.
Two young Egyptians dream to open a glace in Cairo.
A man originating in Malte and another coming from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian family woman came because her children worship Italian ice creams.
The ice master Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is determining not only the good drunken, but also the suspicious sustenance and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during training the cereal on the national superstructure gate and generally from the south: "The Italian ice is just the best: and then she keeps still a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in the manufacture seems to be simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, creme, milk, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixer which is 85 degrees through a electronic program, and then immediately refrigerates four degrees.
Then it opens a robet installed on the machine: there is a pasteurized white creme, based on all kinds of ice in milk.
The formatter is soon asking: Is it possible to produce ice by using only natural substances without stabilising?
How can we provide free course for personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano keeps attention to the fact that he may be induced in error by the spirit of the time.
One who speaks only "fabricated from natural ingredients" may have been used by stabilisers: most often a natural product, such as the grain grain fat obtained from the health haricot.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without using stabilisator, only to sell it within 24 hours, elsewhere, and the client will cross nothing other than ice granules.
Some changes in the basic mass are allowed.
This becomes more tremendous with the aromas.
Master Luciano sets the difference between the ingredients that are obtained in the supermarket ray of fruit or confiseries.
Moreover, there are powder and powder.
"The suppliers will all try to repeat you with twelve aromatised injections."
"Always, you should just try."
Or in the receptions of sorbits to fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or in the ice creams produced from the white base mass that, with eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when cacao powder, constitutes the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must go to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them in time to manufacture four types of ice: to vanille, chocolate, moka and noise with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanille aroma or other natural ingredients.
The various species of ice for fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more pure fruit: from the point of view of go, it is not absolutely better.
The ice to noise doesn't necessarily become the go of the noise when it consists of a large part of noise.
The ice in kiwi, very popular, is manufactured from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilising.
"Only a balanced mixture highlights the go of a ice right," says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation exercise: if fishing cleaning is used with a lot of sugar, the quantity of sugar must be reduced in the basic receipt.
An addition of sugar is necessary for ice to citron.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the various types of fruit (the winners are used to measure the Oechsle grades in the rainmo.)
Happy, tables easily calculate.
Ice production is no longer needed, as sometimes, too much intervention.
This is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the ice mixture is at the same time available to make it honest and returned to negative temperatures.
Despite all automatizations, panels are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is barboous of the pure fruit of the head to the feet and thus strikes his students when the control of the colossal mixer bowl evacuates him.
Master Luciano considers that "a similar incident is able to occur during each course: it is only a time question."
Controllers in ambiguous position
According to certain sources, the industry that experiences genetically plant culture has deceived the European Food Safety Authority.
This is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered as an independent institution for the assessment of bio-consequences.
"This sounds like a theory of conspiration, but we are well teached," said Monich Christoph, then, testbiotech.
Certain information shows that the President of the Efsa Group of Experts for Geneticly plantes, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other experts of Efsa are contracted with the Ili pressure group.
This is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has determined the elaboration of the Ephsa test requirements for genetic plants and, in fact, in a conflict of interests, the critics formulated by Mr. Then.
The prepared requirements are textually corresponding to the positions of the Ili pressing group and thus carry out the mark of the industry which, in the fund, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
It is already the second time Testbiotech refers to a conflict of interest.
A high-range responsible for Efsa has recently joined the Swiss Agricultural Group Syngenta without a transitional period. It has changed the camp.
A short time ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (MTDR), has shown the existence of personal relations between the European Union's control authority and the industrial lobby, which has developed the summary of the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Members.
However, Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
A view indicates that all reliable data are exploited, including those of the industry as long as they are of a good professional quality.
It is not prohibited to experts working for the Ephsa account to contact this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for Live Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ili) based on the United States.
This body is viewed as a neutral forum that includes experts, among others, in the field of science, industry and policy, to evaluate the risks of biodiesel without being a lobby sale.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then discover that genetically accepted plants are accepted without any food tests in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what are, for example, the genetically caused maïs" states Mr. Then.
Current practice consists of testing only the isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If we don't seek the risks, how can we find them?", Mr.
This is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's viewpoint.
This scientific research has been conducted since 1994 in the genetic area and currently works in Zurich's polytechnical oil.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is trying more to influence or discriminate critical scientists.
That is why there are no longer researchers who are not associated with companies.
In the opinion of companies, critical studies would not be conducted.
Mrs. Hilbeck states that "the industry controls security research".
The piece of stone
Uli Gsell looked for it, about 400 kilos.
Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart's garage with her tube at the bottom.
There was a manif.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators were coming and began to demolirate a large part of the northern ail.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousands of people have manifested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central garage into a subterranean garage that will cost a number of billion.
A large part of the oil was in ruins when the manifestation was able to stop the building travels.
Brised in 6000, 7000 songs.
The Muschelkalk (coqui calcarier) of ́ilsheim, a tender and grossier pave built wrong between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor in Ostfildern.
He was looking for a few fragments.
"These stones are ricks."
"They don't have to disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modesty and good market, simple and earthly rock."
He claims that by cutting her to the wheat, he felt the worst of the cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do of this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The traces of Stuttgart's stones lead to an ancient depth of French armies munitions in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man makes the trade of old stones.
He bought all the rocks issued from demolition in Stuttgart.
"What would be a shame if they were concassed or if they disappeared in the decharge," he says in his office in a shot, which sometimes was a watch post.
It rejected insults and threats when the journals reported that he had bought the rest of the northern ail to the demolition undertaking.
But he negotiated over all days with the opposers of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything of all to oppose demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opposers of the S21 project have then brought one of the rock parallels of average 80 kg of which the value is comprised between 6,50 and 14 euros.
Some keep it as a memory in all hopes too can make it when rebuilding.
Rongen had purchased 500 tonnes, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still in the forest, and the rest has been sold for a long time.
Gardens owners, landing gardens, Particulars.
They came from everywhere and took all that could enter the coffre and the remorques.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have been transformed a long time to "Mauerle" or to limitations of grass-band plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular," Mr. Rongen said.
"It wasn't this political component."
He enters his car all the country, turns his large empire of 20 hectares.
He has made rights studies that he has abandoned. Later, he entered in studying the biologic before he then was interested in the informal and finally become a car.
And a stone amateur.
He stores 40,000 tonnes.
He's getting treasures everywhere in Germany.
EL claims that it is the biggest marketing of ancient stones.
He's referring to it.
Sculpted sand stones with art are placed on snow.
"Oh, they were part of the pond of Marienbrücke in Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, confirms it with enthusiasm.
"My preferred stone."
He takes the way that goes through the forest.
He shows a fat of the finger: Red sand, first, part of the garage of Karlsruhe.
And soon.
"Good travery."
The parallel was a part of the court of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, Cannstatt's traveling from the police prefecture, the red grain from the Saint Blasien Cathedral, the tuf from Heilbronn's hospital.
What a work, what effort!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were sculpted with the hand and moved by the help of simple palans and charrettes drawn by bowls, it becomes absolutely respectful.
"What would be a scandale if such an inheritance was placed in the room."
He has not become rich, yet less rich.
But this car is currently employed by 14 people. Moreover, stones, sculptor, forgeron, glass softer and garden have been installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's gratifying," states the recycler of waste.
Procedurefully, it must be returned to Colonia.
There are also stones to save.
Battle of talents to win high potential
The account knows a lifeful influence.
16 students are stuck to buy little bread in the salmon, in the soap and in the white-feeding.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students in design and mechanical genius to a hotel.
In the context of a kind of idea concours, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW conceptors, and, knowing the firm Volkswagen.
Today, many enterprises do not try to go to the body in competition to deny better brain and to engage, such as Volkswagen, in a multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most dullest diplomats as possible in the amphithaatrics before they reach the employment market and they are not covered by others.
And since universities do not have statements about the performance of their students, we are trying to find exceptional talents in the context of practical projects and to relieve them.
On the second day of the atelier organized at the Brauschweig Technical University, the car group appreciates talents.
A young lady of the staff service shares the peopleswagen logos, bonbons and cards.
She talks about the calendary of professional stages and students to young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group's enzyme.
It is Nico Selle of the Braunschweig Technical University who is responsible for the project involved with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal benefits for both parties: "The students are in contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"When the Volkswagen group, he can know the students, look closer to the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into account as a chairman."
According to Mr., such cooperation is adequate.
What is happening again is the official with which we are trying to attract students.
"Instead, the accent was placed on the professional project," Mr. Selle said.
The fight for the conquest of the new diplomates will become much closer.
In sectors, enterprises can no longer recruit their employers by conducting a trial on a candidate kirielle.
But they must gain their confidentiality and, especially, cut the hand of highly qualified work.
These are especially the diplomatics issued from the engineering branches that are in a excellent position to negotiate.
According to VDI German engineers, more than 40 000 engineers have remained unemployed in October.
And VDI's previsions, the voice of engineer posts will grow again.
Roman Dy's goes to the talents for the KPMG account, audit cabinet, accounting experts and advice.
It organizes costly events regarding the recycling of talents, such as the KPMG-Race crucial course, a species of rail paper where competitors need to find their path through GPS coordinates.
The company will therefore send eight promising students next year in order to park the United States in this way.
Participants can accessiblely visit KPMG branches and know the company.
A person who has to participate in it shall be determined forward after two election procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of many candidates will be involved in the United States.
According to Mr. Dyʹ, the means used to search for high potential at universities are more important.
"We want to throw the lot through the cross currency."
"For us, a simple crossière was too little."
For Mr. Dy's talent chassiers, the account is there.
"To this day, we have stayed in contact with all people who have participated in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are on the end of their studies and want to address their requests to our business soon." He said.
Outside the direct adoption made in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are actually classicly involved in the professional offices where they are delivered to the brain chasing.
"We're trying to reach diplomas in the professional rooms."
"For example, in the sun-country room," states Mrs. Sitha Stübe, the guide for hum resources at Solarworld, manufacturing photo-panels.
This company installed in Bonn works approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs. Stübe knows the problem associated with the relief.
Currently, 35 posts are placed in concours on the site of the company.
"In this moment, it's very difficult to give vacant posts."
"This costs nice and takes a lot of time," he's sure?
Another way to establish the contact is to pass through university teachers.
Solarworld has established a cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example the Freebourg University.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional stages or to write his draft study ends with us."
Honourable publishing campaigns are held in the sun specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make its publicity by exercising other qualities: personal ambition, platform hierarchie and easy communication.
"A large group can't do this," supports Mrs. Stübe, head of the staff.
A long time ago, money has no longer played the main role in employment research.
Flexible working hours, children's guards or good opportunities for promotion constitute the other determinant factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld occupies the 55th place among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table of German employees.
In this regard, he asks the employees about their degree of satisfaction in relation to their work and its context, regarding the framework conditions of employees.
The Chief of Mrs. Stübe's staff hopes that this movement will allow the company's image to increase the employment applicants.
"I think the candidates are particularly referring to external evaluations regarding a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Re日 Warler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employee by implementing a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to show more authenticity.
And, Mr. Kriegler, this means first to take internal measures.
"The best way for a employer to become attractive is to pass through his own employers," he said.
This is, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the worker's label in its own efficiency.
"the satisfied posters form the best messengers."
When the employees are well treated and they identify themselves with the company, they do only the publicity of their employees with their friends and knowledge.
"It's like we were playing in an orchestra," Mr. Kriegler says.
Obama makes a frein to the new oil forages
There will be no new oil forages in the Mexico golf at the south-east state of the United States in the next years.
The Government of Washington has proposed a prohibition A balanced prohibition and, thus, finally cancelled its initial plans.
Even at the width of the Atlantic coast, new forages remain for the instant prohibited.
The secretary to the Interior Ken Salazar made this Monday announcement.
This is the explosion in April of the "Deepwater Horizon" forest platform which is originating in this strict prohibition, which must remain in force for at least five years.
In view of this accident that costs life to 11 employees and leads to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, undertaken by the pressure of opposition and the activity sector, indicated that he was willing to authorise the implementation of new forages in the east of the Golf of Mexico.
Participants of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States towards foreign countries for the supply of oil.
The question of knowing who has the responsibility of the devastating golf's responsibility is not permanently resolved until this day.
The British Oil Group, which is confronted with a number of billion payment requests, is located in the center of the EECs.
A questioning committee made by Obama must submit its conclusions on December.
In October, the secretary at Interior Ken Salazar had raised the gel of the decreted forage after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, different oil groups had soon submitted requests for new forage projects.
With stronger control measures and severe security consignments, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent control authority, which has been discriminated after many corruption, is currently subject to deep reforms.
Parallelly, Mr Obama announced that they would remove the profitable tax noces from gas and oil groups.
The operators of this activity sector now hold against the fact that the food debt in the golf would be quite lower than this until now.
"The goal of the Government is to make a rapid growth in the gas and oil sector" -- the result of a current investigation in the sector by the BDO audit cabinet, before the prohibition of the stated forage on Thursday.
Furthermore, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been reported to the deterioration of growth until the new order.
The country of Ogoni is sec
The water covering in the rivers is brun oil; it decreases a smoke like that in the essence station: Because of a refuge, billions of oil litres have destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live from flight, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't throw you out," the soldier lanses the journalists to calm them: "You're still enough oil bubble before the water lamp."
The Nigerian of 37 years tried to photograph a young man in the bowl water to the poetrin, as well as the grass tree that surrounds it: This scene is almost beautiful in the water late with the color of the arc-in-heil.
We can't realize that the sub-sool rejoices of brutal oil brune naps.
On the beach of the Bodo-Jetty Bodo, Esther Badom ra's that she, jadis, collected crops throughout the ground here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely tarious.
Five years ago, a large quantity of oil has gone out of a olive that exploded in the large sea.
Fisheries in the neighborhood city of Bodo must now return six hours to reach fishing waters: the country Ogoni in the heart of the Delta of Niger is considered as one of the most contaminated regions in the world.
All the extent of the ravages shoots in the eyes when the mangrove marais are parked through water courses.
Instead of water, the engine ship finds a marron cradingue water. Whoever spends his hand takes it away from any oil covering.
Small mangrove racines come out of the ground as riley bottles. Isolated palmiers thrilledly put their palms on.
We are looking for bird clouds, as usually meet in humid areas: Since the board engine stops, a fantomatic silence gets on this Paradise again that reacts to a service station by the degree he delays.
"What happens here is war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a trist air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent risk of health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni lives is a battle field set for decades ago: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorators have passed here; the first resistance was organized in 1980 by the Ken Saro-Wiwa, which was exempt later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because these were very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the country of Ogoni is prohibited to this society: While more than 2 million black gold bars are pomped daily by more than 5000 pounds of forage and 7000 miles oleoducs in the area of Delta, three times large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the country of Ogoni are unexploited because the situation is too instable for this oil group.
All of the hundred meters stood in the water of the trees in ace as bizarres sculptures: "Nighty trees" are very affectingly drawn up forest heads.
They have up to 50 years, most of them are thrown by the corrosion until the depth.
Akpobari believes that a head of this nature is cut off of time in song, because a constant float of brutal oil cool in water.
According to the estimates of experts, more than two billion litres were overtaken on the 日osem in 50 years: Each year, the quantity of oil is equal to the sea in the age of the Super-petroleum "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago, one of the largest environmental catastrophes in the history of mankind.
Who must be responsible for continuous environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and siphonization of olive oil are responsibility for more than 90 percent of pollution. The environmentalists for their part consider the explosions of forage heads and perforated olive oil as the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Stested replied to the Shell group to apply in Nigeria mainly less strict security standards than anywhere in the world: Only the deficiencies rate of conduct is "which higher than all of them".
Some forms bring mangroves to a place that, viewing a far away, resort to a abandoned apartment, full of cambodge and installed with free air: they are completely nud and covered of cambouts to the cow.
A shintile fire under one of the many tonnes that soon connected to the tuyals, soon spared without motive on the site, must be repered: a small clandestine raffinery.
We're making the brute oil in the tunnel for several hours, explaining Michael, the team head.
In the first time, the extent falls into a recipient holding by tuyals, then, at the extent of the cherozen woods falling and finally gets from diesel.
This is how Michael and his four manufacturers produce four f's of Diesel 300 litres daily: "This reports us 34,000 Naira", about 22 dollars.
The population of Delta is part of the chronic fuel penure in the largest country of oil producer in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffinery.
Illegal raffiners can sell to a less lower price than that lowerly lower than 40 centimeter euro per litre of Diesel: Because they are freely buying their first material.
This is offered by the "protectors" which put the olive oil network throughout the Ogoni countries. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million oil litres in the Delta of Niger.
Only a small part of the first provisionally involved material is illegally cleaned: the networks of organised crimes that also count among its members of high-range politicians and military soldiers, loading the part of the lion in tankers and braking it on the world market.
The militant Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether the environmental catastrophe should be attributed or, rather, to the population or to the laxist production mode, is clearly academic.
"If oil companies were not considered as intruses and the foundations of fishermen's life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no flights and illegal raffiners."
But, inter alia, the relationships of Ogoni, especially towards Shell, were so deceived that it was no longer question than the retreat of the group. "It may be that the operators who have other nationalities, such as Chinese, would be better."
So Michael becomes nervous.
"It's a big time you're disgusting" announces the strong oven of the oil.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of armed forces, they will not make the object of an arrest, but they will also offer them pools of wine.
Even soldiers from the north of the country, especially, can benefit as all the Nigerians of the primary matter.
"In all view, this fig tree has caused our country to fall very low," appealed Akpori.
Researchers discover building failures in A380 reacters
A380 manifestly suffers a huge security problem.
By examining an apparatus that has made an emergency attempt, researchers have discovered a possible construction failure that can lead to "catastrophic deficiency of the reaction".
The Air Company Qantas now wants to complain against the manufacturer of the reacter.
In the beginning of November, the Airbus passengers belonging to the Quantas company had even more opportunities: During the request that it conducted, the Australian air security authorities found that the reacters of some A380 devices had a serious security problem, and she cared against a possible construction failure.
This potential deficiency could cause serious consequences: it may cause weakness cryking and flexibilities at the level of the oil vehicle compliance, indicating in a position taken on Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic deficiency of reactions".
Rolls-Royce reacters are concerned and equip 20 airlines from the A380 series.
The Airbus of the Quantas company, which had to argue on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian Air Company has now committed Judician prosecutions against the manufacturer of reacters.
It has presented a Judicial complaint to an Australian Federal Court whose seat is in Sydney, which gives him the opportunity to take other legal measures against the society.
The director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim interests in the incident in the beginning of November.
Some pieces were distracted and the surface was damaged during the engine's incendie.
According to Rolls-Royce, this is the oil inflammation that is from the origin of the degrees.
After this incident, at least 40 reactions must now be replaced in the world.
Australian researchers have announced that other safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with reactions in question.
Security Recommendations are the result of a Rolls-Royce . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The security problem is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After his aircraft aircraft, the Quantas aircraft had immobilized its entire A380 flot for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
The Lufthansa company replaced the A380 reacter by a precautionary measure.
The plane at two stages is the biggest line plane in the world.
Snow loss throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany covered all white covering: On one night, the snow fell on almost all the country.
Chaos rules on all roads, trains and aircrafts.
At least three people have died in accidents of employment.
The winter makes Grelotter Germany: By glacial temperatures, almost all the Republic is covered by snow in Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many places.
On the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 meters per place.
The employment is highly restricted on several auto-outs and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they could not end the snow that did not stop accumulating.
Moreover, rafhal violents have bapped the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office of Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) has been attracted to these race-marines with the Baltic Coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels that can reach 1,2 m above the normal.
Snow snows on the australies and on the federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxe.
That is why the Meteomedia warning center announced the violated warning level was announced in Sweden: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, there were 30 metres of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds were spread.
Several trucks and cars remained there in the night.
Even in the country of saxe-Anhalt, police authorities announced serious disturbances on the road.
On the A2, snow and wind caused an interruption of the ability and caused bowls.
In Thuringe, snow falls touched the authors A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious trends have occurred in Saxe, Saxe-Anhalt, Thuringe and North of Baviera.
The main problems are: snow on iron roads, trees fallen on iron roads, category or age destroyed.
In Saxe, we had to stop the interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, a ICE train at Munich's destination had to stop his journey.
Pumpiers and paramedics had to provide the 165 train passengers in covering, food and drinking.
Snow winds cut off the roads.
The Snow Chutes introduced many flight cancellations in the main airports of Germany.
According to a portfolio of the standard and information on flights, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A portfolio of Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been canceled to France on the face.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers in the airport are no longer many, despite that they are not available for 400 beds.
The accidents have occurred after midnight on many roads.
On the night in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost life during a trip with a train at a level.
The train driver has been wounded.
A similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck has been locked at a level because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost life.
Four passengers were hurt in the train, therefore the way from Bayreuth to Nuremberg has been closed until the mattimes.
Furthermore, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a tone on a shot in Aschaffenburg.
However, the weatherologists announce a good news: Snow will always be mosque and powderous, but it will turn into the case of rafals.
But the wind's going to be deceived.
Only the Baltic Sea will be distressed by violent and fast winds.
However, he is very cold, up to at least 15 degrees per places.
The Deutsche Bank looks for a buyer for her own tours.
The Dutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem: According to the information reported by journals, this financial institution seeks purchasers for its two immobile offices in France.
This immobile could report up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just been embelling the group's seat: The same tours in the Fourth of Business have been modernized; waiting, the bans had to return to their former service place.
The financial group therefore seeks clearly to recover the costs of renewals and seeks a buyer for its two immobiles, such as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", quoting a portfolio.
This portfolio did not indicate the reasons for the purposes of the sale.
He said, "We'll check if it's more interesting for us to take care of the immobiles or sell them, and to restore them later."
Thus, the largest financial institution of Germany has already fallen in its seat, a little after.
Only in the middle of 2007, the bank had purchased a total of 272 million euros with own fund holders and then had rehabilitated them.
Transformations regarding energy optimisation included, according to certain indications, approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously report a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the journal, the experts of this activity sector estimate the value of tours, repeated in the "Green Tours", about 500 million euros.
According to the password, we do not know now whether the immobile will be sold again to a fund belonging to the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people weep the little ones who lost.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought about the small insepults who were declared dead after several explosions occurred in a mine.
We were still not able to remont the body because the safety situation of the sinist puits continues to be preserved.
Just two weeks a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near Greymouth town.
29 minors of the age between 17 and 62 were buried under the earth.
A sond was introduced into the synist puzzle, but there was no trace of surrounding.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions followed, no sugar team could be declined into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration believed that the minors had no more chance to survive.
To this end, the bodies will not be able to be remonted.
Today, parents and friends have organized a party to the Memorial of the Dead.
Thousands of people were gathered under a sun in Greymouth on the south of the New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of 29 miners, 29 tables were installed on which we could see names, cakes and lamps.
Personal photos and effects, including clothes and surf plates, also had their place.
The flags were set before all the public buildings of the country.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said to the participants at the Memorative Festival that New Zealand feeded the hope that the minors would return to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the sheets said that he cannot resign to accept his son's death until he has seen his rest.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial Festival.
Minors of South Africa and British origin also entered during the first explosion of 19 November.
The securists started to cut an incendie inside the coal mine of the South Zealand Island.
The Gary Knowles police prefect explained to journalists that when explosive gas mass is moved, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to swallow.
Get out of hell, war!
Is the Splatter movie a artificial movie?
The Nicolas Winding Refn explodes the terms of the older type through his film, "Wallhalla Rising", the populated fighter.
Which public was the Danish Nicolas Winding Refn well able to think by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A war Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) had only a eye made prisoner; he is freed from his bowry and, with a almost surnatural force, removes his adversaries each other after others. This is ideal for young men's spectators seeking a bloody action, just because our hero uses brutal ability methods. When he is bad humor, he throws the heads of his enemies without waiting for those to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the movie, the bourney does not say any word about his true name. Even the other persons are allowed to escape around one or two phrases a few exciting cries of agony.
Otherwise, there is nothing to say and we are festival in the incroy mountain landscape in Ecosse, which constitutes the cover of the Vikings Universe, about a thousand years ago.
This would be more ideal for the maturists who have an interest in existence and excellent traveling.
When a movie shows several target groups, it is damage that these are mutually excluded.
The Winding Refn is considered, since the "Pusher" release, his trilogy relating to the pharmaceutical and full of drug trafficking, as a species of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but it is to bring a little more humor to the dominant cowant or introduce a little less brutality to the art and test cinema.
Most of the sympathisants of the art cinema must test the horrible face to the brain that spreads around and to the instincts.
The amateurs of action films die, when the ship is embarked, for reasons that we can freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship at Jerusalem's destination; they are deceived during the calmness and brush before the team comes to America and continues to taste.
It's not surprising that "Walhalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that it only exists in the DVD format.
It is especially because of the wonderful images of the mistress that deserved a certain attention, but also because the image of a palpitant movie, from time to time to time, hides behind a pretensive and bloody appearance.
It's not dialogues in this movie, or coherent action, everything is ambition, a fiery dream transformed into a movie.
The spectator can't escape there.
Ref often gives him a moment of detention and slowly cut him the grass with glacial images and a lump sound band, but especially with an inseasable hate that hurts the heart of the persons.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully at the side of the wound, keeps a certain innocentity, all others are animated by anger.
More than all, the hero borns whose mobiles are never with, but who comes from the fire at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into fighting, maybe it is sent by the Devil himself.
It represents the breakdown, but maybe, nothing but for those who are, in any way, perish.
"Walhalla Rising" is a energetical movie that can be hated or addicted, which finally has an aggression, enthusiasm and excitement.
A traumatising experience.
Mystery terrace travels
The International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) has new indications on a nuclear programme developed by the AEA.
However, this country is able to take position on this subject, even less than to submit to the controls of the Agency.
At night of 5 to 6 September 2007 to midnight, at least four of the F-15 I israelians attacked a mystery of forms on the Syrian territory.
It is on the river of the ephrate; the largest town nearby is 30 miles: it is Dair as-Sur.
His name is found in the AIEA documents, because it is the question of the reacter that the reactor built appears with the help of North Korea in the rock parallel, discomulation in a valley marked by the absent of electric core.
According to a recording of the United States information services, the concurrent reacter, known as the neighborhood site, El Kibar, would be well able to produce a pluto, which would allow atomic weapons to manufacture.
However, this technology is valid since the 1950s.
A video showed a presentation containing flowing satellite images.
By means of the assisted animation, it indicated the emplacement of each component of the reacter before the destruction of the central, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear central.
Moreover, she presented the photos showing the building nearby, even inside it.
It was that the reacter was on the point to be served, but he was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after Israel's bombing, we have much more information than at the time, even with the time the mystery has grown more.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in its memories that before this attack, the 日 was sure that the reacter had built in El Kibar, but had no longer disposed to show that the country was developing "a active nuclear weapons programme".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more acquainted with this and speak only of a "presumed reaction", even if they consider the presentation of the "plausable".
They denied tangible evidence, as well as the AIEA.
Asked on the way he assured that he had a nuclear reaction, a United Nations high-range diplomate gave only a laconic response by claiming that the AIEA had "successful documents to ask questions".
The Syrians have promptly removed the depths of the "unused military building" and made a methodic planning of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of AIEA experts conducted by the former inspector leader of Oli Heinonen was covered in El Kibar of humans.
Furthermore, the AIEA received a Member State from the pictures of the satellites of trade providers showing the time that followed directly the attack.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, has purchased them.
It is therefore impossible for the AIEA to establish their authenticity in a objective way.
The Lage has always assured that she has never implemented a secret atom program and that she has not built a reacter.
• Supports that the ura found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
However, the AIEA has accused this argument after analysis of particulates by qualifying it as inversible.
Since that time, ladies have discussed any discussion about this, as about satellite images.
Furthermore, the controllers do not allow to perform a second inspection on the site of El Kibar and access to the bathroom shoes destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinated silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently said, "We will never make comments on this matter."
This is so that the question on this matter has been long since June 2008 without a result, and it is "creasingly converted into a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as it recognises a high-range diplomat at the AIEA seat in Vienna, and it is finally a serious violation of the nuclear weapons prohibition Treaty.
The AIEA considers that in order to achieve progress, the existence of the three other installations must be cleared with the reacting summary.
Until now, the inspectors have not indicated what installations it is here, or what their function or what they are supposed to contain.
According to the information provided by the journal "Sudeutsche Zeitung", they are known in the AIEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as well as the name of the neighborhood cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security (Institut for International Scientific and International Security) of Washington identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex nearby Masyaf that would be most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible to be located in a military basis or directly next to this; this is exactly why the AIEA inspectors are accessible to three sites.
In Vienna, it is stated that the inspection group is actually a spice that would be sent on behalf of the United States by the AIEA to spy military installations.
In fact, it is a information provided by the American secret agents who attached the attention of nuclear inspectors.
AIEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made ships between the three sites and the rock parallel to transport materials.
A western high-rang diplomat said to Vienna that at least one of the installations could "serve for the production of fuel".
It would not have "no sensitive activities" such as the enrichment and reduction of the ur; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reacter is probably functioning by the non-enrich ura.
However, there is a ridicule of claimable hypotheses concerning the following questions: from where the ur should come and where the pluton would have been separated later for the production of the bomb.
It is ignored whether the graves, which could hide high value tracks, were stored in the three sites.
When the 100 cents of land loaded cars are lost, no one will have information on the storage site of the stocks.
For the AIEA, it is little that the AIEA has examined the al-Tibni sale mine in 1998, which is only a few miles from the Kibar, on the other side of Euphrate, to see if it can agree to store radioactive wastes.
By analyzing recently photos taken by satellite for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the AIEA, Mr. Robert Kelley established a link between these and the relevant responsor.
Photos taken by satellite, however, show that the AIEA has undertaken terrace travels in the three suspected sites and moved large containers when the AIEA started to require access to these sites.
It is possible to be a coincidence, but it has not contributed to separate suspicions.
In the diplomatic environments, the AIEA had been developing a plan on inspections to be carried out for several months. This plan should have been allowed to preserve possible military secrets. Only the investment time shows the great interest of inspectors in this case.
It also ended this proposal.
A year ago, if the OA diplomats in Vienna did not have been stated to the destruction of the reacter, the emergency would not be reported for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador, who has recently stated what is known under the name of the special inspections, one of the most powerful means that the Atomic Agency has to carry out its controls.
The Director of the AIEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "a option to which I am open in the future," but he is still quiet.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, most of the AIEA Governors Council and a great number of 35 countries that are represented are not wanted to see the situation as a scale.
On the other hand, like this diplomate that gives to think, "Will he serve, if they finally find nothing?"
Love in Wartime
It's wrong since Angelina Jolie's started as a realistic.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a story of love between a woman originating in Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We don't know anything about this story, but it's enough to cause disease.
A continuous sound indicates that the woman, a Muslim, was lovingly fallen from her Serb's board during the war of Yugoslavia.
The Federation of Bosney women immediately protested, and in response, certain tourning sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in Hungary last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is turned to Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to the information provided in a Bosnian journal, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of victims of war victims addressed an correspondence to Angelina Jolie by the United Nations High Commissioner for the Research (HCR) and requested to meet the actor.
It is not diplomatic, but a few weeks ago, she proposed these women to keep a meeting with them in Hungary, but they refused this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic states.
There were no loving stories in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie said it quite long about his attitude towards victims.
The Guarantian reports that the Hasecic organization then recommended the United Nations High Commissioner to restore the quality of good voluntary ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies from his scenario, gave after some exhibitions a tournament authorisation to Sarajevo, but we do not know why it was not then coming despite this authorisation.
The young author assures herself that she does not continue political goals with her film, that it is by making much effort that she has committed to the conflict of Yugoslavia, which supports that she wants to carry out the terrible consequences of the war and gives the opportunity to all parties concerned to express it.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is a second synopsis of the movie in the Net. It is very different: Lovers knew themselves well before the beginning of the war. It meets again when the woman, a Bosnian muslim, is deported into the Serb concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
What is likewise a big difference with the version "a victim of violence loves his board."
That Jolie's movie started well before war, of course.
The pressure on it, thus expressed by Jolie, is "injustified and based on wrong information".
Now, only Hollywood's fanatics can seek peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, as many others before.
Let's shoot us!
This evening, everything goes well with the Irish.
No consternation trace.
That is why the local team dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans strive from joy in a strong music, they slow down their feet.

Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtil drinking game and the booked information, these two behaviors are really not going well.
Yet, despite this, the 26-year-old young man is trying to enjoy, turn away from the divorced question, which will be on the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in its projects. In January, it will lead an ambassador in New Zealand.
"I'm trying a strange feeling," he said.
"The country is so far and I don't have any job."
Finally, her girlfriend had already acted in Auckland, "in less than two, she dismissed her desired job as an evental project loaded, perhaps a good sign," said the young man with a smile.
Because of shadow perspectives in the country, two of the three sisters of Tanner tried their opportunity to the foreigner.
Her sister Yvonne, a social assistant, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now takes an informal consultant post in London.
Youths go: The situation of most of the families living on the island reveals the tanners.
Experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute indicate that 100,000 Irelands will soon leave their country.
They even provide a number of 200,000 emigrants from 2015.
This represents a great loss for a small country of 4,5 million residents.
If these previsions are fulfilled, it will be an immigration currency comparable to what Ireland suffered in 1980.
After a decade of economic boom in which Irelands have played a big deal, the harm now takes the whole place.
However, economic crisis affects, especially the young Irish, well-formed, who have not yet known only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social disaster seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's more money.
But in the meantime, three persons in ten of less than thirty years are in the labour.
The Irish Times magazine remarks the letters of readers published by young emigrants, which claim: "In Ireland, everything goes to the destruction."
"There should be an elevation against politicians and bans, but the one who has the opportunities of it is going and our country is so a whole generation."

"It's a trist and depressive thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying positively to address this topic.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" room that provides a complete support on the "work in the foreign".
"But the work in the foreign is an extraordinary opportunity to make the first steps at the levels of professional hierarchie," states the responsibility.
His website shows photos of surfers and snow surfs in Canada.
The message is: Working in the foreign is not a galery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
Since six months, Sean O'Donovan, he knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was no more to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish in the construction sector and Germany.
A mode house is just out of the ground to Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan visits only rarely his country, because he participates in an additional job, so that he can purchase the contracted credit to build his house in the country.
"The situation is already a little deep," he states by breathing the level of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I won't win money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't live anymore."
He strikes out of an embarrassed ride through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-sook gardens, costous cars of large marks are placed on the roads of access.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with her sister for a total of 380,000 euros, financed by 100 percent.
"There were times of foolishness, without doubt, money was easy," he said.
Has he feared to see everything in ruling because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks about a moment, resurrected from the warm tee and said, "I don't have children to enjoy and I'm young; even if everything goes through, I can share in zero."
The engineer of the battle does not love the lamentations he often hears these last days.
"Nobody must suffer hungry, our situation is not even as dramatic as what we have been here sometimes in the island," he supports.
"T spend for a while in the foreigner, it is not what can happen worse, perhaps that makes us feel about Ireland.
He rided and then talked about his father who went to earth during the last large economic crisis.
"It was returning after it was seven years old and, in Ireland, life was simply continued."
This idea likes Cian Tanner.
Making the future and discovering how the life is going else.
In his palmary, he has already counted a few years of work in London. That is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his friend.
But there is another thing that cares well in these last days: the festival to organize at his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't be transformed into awesome night.
"Only, not many emotions," he said by drinking a long beer grass.
"And adieu, it seems like anxious."
"Let us rather call this a night to see again, all detained, gathering some friends, with some drinks and some games."
Democratic Routine
The support for the democracy in Latin America continues to act, as the private company.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latino Barometer survey taken in 18 countries and held in the Economyst.
Since the investigation has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows the changes of view in the region.
Two related elements include the results of the investigation of this year, carried out in September and in the beginning of October.
The first is the latin America's quite sole humor.
The second is the growing stability of the attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
The support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the surrounding of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached in average 6% per year since 2002, democracy support has exceeded at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
He also increased in Mexico, where the economy was resurrected after a strong reduction in production last year.
But only about half of the responsibles in Mexico and Brazil, the two largest countries in the region, are convinced democratics, which makes the regional average deterioration (see Table 2).
Some 44% of the responsibles of the region have been satisfied with the way the democracy of their countries worked in practice; it is the same number as the last year but with a strong increase in 25% in 2001 (graph 3).
About 34% said that they trusted in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as the last year in the two cases, but greatly increased in 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
10 years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have increased the support for democracy.
If this has been good during the world financial crisis, it is probably due to the fact that many of America's countries have reached only a short recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin-American lives in poverty only increased in 2009 and renewed this year to 32%.)
But the humor varies from one country to another (see graph 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outcome president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are translated by a widely shared feeling of progress
What is rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more heavy and where violent crimes grew up.
This is only for the second time since the investigation has started more responsible to the Latin America in its own, the crime has been quoted instead of unemployment as the most important problem for their countries (see Table 5).
Approximately 31 per cent say that themselves or one of their neighbors have been victims of an act of the echoed year; however, this number is decreased by 38 per cent in the last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A stronger economic performance reflects the increase in support to the private undertaking and market economy: approximately 71% of the responsibles in the region say that the private company is essential for development, against 56% in 2007 (see graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their countries developed, against 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the Venezuela responsibles are of this opinion (and 80% support the private undertaking); even though their Left President Hugo Chavez exhaust many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of the questioned persons (contrast 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged in comparison to the last year) and Venezuela (9%, lower than 11% since the last year)
However, the United States are considered as the most affected country by the responsibles in Mexico and in the largest part of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A Balanced vote
Nobody had perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the outsides who wanted to help the land synised and in fear.
Guidelines and new voting bulletins were presented in the guitars, inscated voting offices and intimidations
The voting offices would open late night.
Many Haitians, including many who were moved after January seizure, would be in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended by abandoning.
A twelve candidate to the President, whose many favours were assumed, denied the fraude and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protections, sometimes violent, exploded through the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the high officer in Haiti of the United Nations, views the event as "a very good choice in a lot of views".
The observers of the United States and the Caribbean Community claimed that they did not believe that such irregularities, as serious, were necessary to invalidate the process.
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposers are revokable to René Preval, shall be the president of immobiliar exit, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second expected tour is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former lady, returned from their initial call to say the vote no.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has a little or no support perceptible in the electors, is stated by the electoral authority as having reached the second tour, reached the second tour.
With a cholera epidemic that makes rash, and more than 1 million surrounders in the seism that still live in tents, we were afraid that the participation would be.
In fact, many haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing it because of the disorganisation.
Approximately 250 000 identity cards needed to vote were not distributed a little while before election.
The game is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and popular government as an important step in the rebuilding of Haiti.
And so, it is, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of the foot to the center
The weeks after having become soon widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, benefited from a public sympathic vague that enhanced its 20-point approval rate, more than 50%; it is its highest level since it was chosen in 2007.
However, transforming this into a successful campaign for a second mandate during a election in the next year could depend on the choice of Mrs. Fernández, which would leave or not the incessance of her husband's dead, pre-decessor and ancient political partnership, Nestor Kirchner.
And, about this, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife succeeded her as the President, had the habit of developing budgets that underestimated tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to expendirate additional income to voluntary.
The Government of Mrs Fernández lost its majority in the Congrès last year on paper.
But the opposite is divided, and the situation was devastated after Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart crisis on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the perronist movement to the power were addressed to Mrs. Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (which a parliamentary struck one of his couples and others accused the Government of corruption), the Congrès must not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to dispute," said the President.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied in the next year, allowing the Chairman a more larger management margin to expenditure.
Economy broadcasts: it is likely to grow about 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1% but many private estimates and the salarial refunds of syndicates, seeing that number is nearly 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took his functions in 2003 when Argentine was afraid of economic eradication, made a priority for growth and reduction of poverty instead of control of inflation.
He was able to treat the FMI, he made the private sector and purchased the INDEC, the statistical office, which made statistics on official inflation.
Can Mrs Fernández now modify these policies?
It called for a parliament between private enterprises and syndicate leaders.
And his officers say they want to limit payment increases in the next year to 18%.
Economy was stimulated by high world prices of agricultural exports from Argentina.
However, the inflation was decreased by the growth of powder after a strong assessment in 2002.
It may be why Mrs. Fernández shows signs of desire to restore the financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the obligations that had committed an earlier forced debt for which Argentine did not regulate its expense in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be adding to an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted on the fact that this could not be involved by the FMI's monitoring, as it is coutum.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economics, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to create a new national indice of consumption prices, which results in a prejudice to IDEC.
It is not if Mrs. Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of its mandate, now that her husband is not on his side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the medium class, among which the chirchnerism is very prolonged.
When the Argentinas will return from their sea vacations in March, the sympathic vague for her will have refluxed.
If she wants to gain another choice, she should decide to replace whether or not, without a voice, many policies of her husband.
A half-hour for China
The Taiwan electors oriented to a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother from the other side of the detriment?
More than 7,5 million electors were presented on November 27, or 70 per cent of the approved persons, to elect municipal officers and advisers in five cities, in the context of what is considered as a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings compared to the continent, with innovative business links, including a free trade package, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. My test has successed, but it's just right.
Although its part Kuomintang (KMT) received three of the five Mays, he failed to receive the majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressist Partie (DPP), who pending to the full independence of Taiwan, received approximately 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If that had been a presidential vote, Mr. Ma would be in difficulty.
Since two years ago, the vote part of its party has fallen about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attached electors, even with KMT in municipal advice.
The event has declined most of the main subjects of Taiwan elections, including taped campaign trucks and mass racing flags with girls who were dancing at minimum.
An obliged mystery attempt has also been perpetrated.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the honorary president of KMT, has made a electoral tour for a KMT candidate at the guard of the election.
A man of the people shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, hurting him and killing a man.
Wonderfully, it was not determined whether the leader wanted to do bad to Mr. Lien or to make a difference with the candidate.
Thus, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, said that the murderer had effects on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning the electors to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of elections was China.
It was fair to find out the issue of the continental party itself was absent.
Instead, candidates have played plans for public housing and creation of employment.
Taiwan usually plays his independence and hates China's military threat.
Hence, KMT has the tendency to avoid stoping its relationship with the Government of Pekin.
But this time, the DPP also refused to reach the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the answer to a new consciousness which Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, in its part, revoked a confirmation to know whether its Chinese policy was acceptable for the majority of Taiwan.
It can be expected that the Government of Pekin continues to provide commercial facilities, in its strategies aiming on Taiwan, returning to bear.
China has not lost time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, it would like to see a political integration; but we start with the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP has always re-invented.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison after corruption.
The President of 2000 to 2008 was a prosecutor for an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has seen the day under the direction of Mrs. Tsai and the PDP is working in order to attach professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was welcomed as a DPP candidate to the Presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also associate with Pékin.
Mrs. Tsai announced plans for a expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could be made without preliminary conditions.
Mrs. Tsai ra's to the Taiwan public that its party presents a "alternative worth confidence" in relation to Mr Ma's primary approach to China.
Mr. Chen 日 exposed to this amendment.
In a statement from its cell, he stated that the PDP candidates would have received better results if they insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a different country.
He even commanded Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to break the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulties to choose between its potential candidates.
KMT must make a self-introspection.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were low; despite a virtuous economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its impartiality is largely due to unemployment and extension of the foes between rich and poor.
A KMT portfolio says that its cabinet and its local antennes will be reviewed.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for the approach is limited.
At the same time, most Thaiwanians see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a editorial eminent, "the point of no return has already passed."
Names to Grammy Awards: Esperanza Spalding jazz song is a surprise selected in the "best new artist" category
Follow on the request of a President, and people are able to know it.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist, who was in hand by President Obama to take place during its ceremonie of the Nobel price of the Paix in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a great envergure nomination in the category of the "best new artist".
As Spalding is a very known figure on the jazz scene since 2008, "Hope", the nomination remains a little mysteryous but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards, which a artist must not exit more than three albums before recording, which "establishes the identity of this artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", was probably marked a step forward and, since its vocal is implied, his famous hand of pop and → and its latin influences, it is possible for at least one line pointed in Spalding in comparison with the successful success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent to the electors of the Grammy Awards, taking into account jazz productions in this category in the last years.
In addition, the Grammy Awards' electors have just honored "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio in the "instrumental album" category, a recycling freshion of a record that was one of the primary favors last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" of the Veterinary James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboardist John Beasley will also be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favored to the raw voice of the New Orleans and invited to the "Treme" of HBO, was honored in the modern jazz category, which, otherwise, moves strongly to a certain combination with Stanley Clarke albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of salvage Darcy James Argue, known to the steampunk, has won some well-deserved things in the great category; in competition with Billy Childs' rich chamber-jazz and the eternal aventury Dave Holland, whose "Pathways" album of his octets' live was a great example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group head.
Nomination du Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey are running into classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy Awards are conducting a mixture of musicians and compositors throughout the world.
On the head of the nominations, citons "God Ex Machina" of Michael Daugherty, for the plan and orchestra, with five "yes" and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, a electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the names associated with South California, there is the Estonian compositor Arvo Pärt for his Symphonie No.4, "Los Angeles", a work commanded by the Philharmonic Orchestre of Los Angeles and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the compositor based on Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in school for a repository.
The classic nominations are distributed in 13 categories covering records of orchestra, oper, coral and solar.
A category for the classic producer of the year provides five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies no.3 and 4 of Bruckner of the King Orchestra of the Concertge building; "Good Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium is the art of Castrati" and "Requiem" of the Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the Category of the Opera, the names are "Lulu" of the Orchestre of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of Germans Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestre and the Chöur of the Theâtre Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoé" of Arthur Suōvan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.

The work of approximately 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oilmangate of Mikhaïl Khodorkovski, prisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was named for its solist instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The compositor of Los Angeles said that he had written the work of 15 minutes especially for the interview of the Mandoline Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis En日, sitting in New York.

In the classic mixture category, Jesse Norman's supernoon received a nomination for its recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The draft Temecula Mosquee reports the approval of the Planning Committee.
A draft Mosque in Temecula received a single support from the Local Planning Committee after more than five hours of public witnessing, often passionate.
Criticals took place in the draft statement that it promoted both terrorism and trade emballages.
But the Commissioners stated Thursday evening that the new religious center had respected local laws and that it would be extremely impressive.
"Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, took the word on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it as a American citizen."
"These shows that justice is the lead."
"The opposition is really minimal," he said.
"They have just very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting started at 18 hours and dured until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the center, at the time of nearly divided words, the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the journal's website.
"There is no more America," wrote an intervenant.
"It's another planet of singers with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned islamic centres have also survived protests in other parts of the country, including in the Ground Zero, in the place of attitudes of 11 September 2001 in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denied violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families of the order without incident in Riverside's composition for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the entertainment she praised on a property shared with a manufacturer of water filtering systems.
The new mosquet of 24,943 feet in the Mediterranean architecture would be composed of two minerals and would be 43 feet up.
She would take a site of 4,32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral school.
Opponents can still call against this project to the municipal Council.
A microbe tolerant arisnic highlights the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or otherwise.
The covering of a strange, which can use the arsnic as one of its nutritional elements, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps outside.
Although researchers have discovered the earth's area, they say that it shows that life has opportunities besides the major elements that have been considered as essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphor, or with arisnic."
"This is why she is very special, even if she is far from being a real "external" life form," commented Paul Davies C. W. from the University of State of Ariuna, the co-autor of the report contained in the Science Journal on Thursday.
Six major elements have been considered as essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, azote, oxigen, phosphor and pain.
However, researchers discovered that the sea in Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replaced phosphore by arisnic.
"We ask ourselves what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arierna, co-autor of the report.
The discovery is important in the search of life outside the earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life does, says Anbar.
The study is on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the floor, generated speculations extended on the Internet which the report could spread the coverage of an alien life.
That wasn't the case.
The covering "shows that, in other planetary environments, the organisms could be able to use other elements to action biochemia and that the "standard" engine of elements, which we absolutely consider necessary for life, could not be fixed", commented Charles Cockell, professor of the Planetary and Space Research Institute, Open., Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of a element to another biochemical and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
It wasn't a fortuite cover.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrology Institute, who conducted the study, chose the Mono Lake because it is given high levels of arsnic.
The arisnic and phosphor are chemically similar, so it spied that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace one to another.
"The arsenic is primarily toxic because its chemical behavior is really similar to the phosphor."
"Agencies therefore have difficulties to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arisnic is pretty different so that it doesn't work exactly like phosphor; it goes inside and, in some way, goes the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the rubber known under GFAJ-1 and exposed it to growing arsenic concentrations to which it could adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphor, but the fact that it can live with arsnic at the place highlights the possibility that a form of life using the arsnic may occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where the arisnic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, a medical professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, which arisnic could be replaced by phosphor, was not new; but nothing showed that it could work.
The arisnic was more often at the beginning of the earth's existence; so the researchers issued the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth was created at the beginning," said Foster, which was not part of Wolfe-Simon search team.
Research was financed by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute.
The last two furnished exhibitions dogs were found in Compton
The two other dogs of exhibition on four furnishes from the outside of a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of the comte of Los Angeles announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibitions dogs - two acits and two corgis pembroke gallois - have disappeared on Monday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck where they had passed the night outside of a 6 motel of Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered after midnight and the other two were found at the end of Thursday evening, said to Steve Whitmore, the portfolio of the department of the sheriff of the County of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are going well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good forms."
"There were returned to their owners."
Whitmore said exactly where the dogs were found, in which quarter and in which circumstances they covered.
"A investigation is running."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
The owners of dogs, Christina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered on Thursday after midnight with their two Akitas in a refuge for animals of the comté in Downey.
Sheriff adjoints found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month woman, was healthy and safe, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgies that Rickard and Peek had planned to show to regional concours this week, for the owners of the Japanese dogs, were lost until their divorce evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend in the "AKC/Eukanuba" national campionat of Long Beach, where they were able to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other tests provided in the days of the "AKC/Eukanuba" exposure, said Peek at Wednesday.
South California is one of the arrests of the canin exposition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They are often staying in the motels and running their truck outside, just next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a chiot Boxer, a ter· Parson · and a British Spanish - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and the corgis, to the worst hole, in the truck where it would be more costly.
They have a little open windows so that dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6 Thursday.
Peek said that they would offer a repeat to any person who could lead them to the corgis, with an implanted micropuzz to identify them.
It's not if a repee has been granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to red again, MGM's repeatation is more than the final green fire of the corn
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green fire to start again at zero.
A Federal Court officially praised the "pre-emballed" plan by the creditors, which would be eliminated by about 5 billion dollars of the debt; opening the road to the enterprise, having 86 years of existence, to make its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television emissions.
With the decision of June, which is satisfied with the requirements of the United States failure code, no legal obstacle remains in front of the MGM to fleet under the headquarters of Entertainment Spyglas, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become general directors of what will be a graduated study.
The staff will be returned to approximately 320 to 400.
MGM will not actually deal with Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a credit facility of $500 million, intended to finance the new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under licence by the investment bank, which is EUR 75 million, and should be financed until mid-December.
The study review process started in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was engaged in consulting the direction on the way to place its funds, since it had no means to pay interests to 300 million dollars per year.
In the month of ao, the Director-General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an elderly Enron PDG, and a re-research expert for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and to satisfy more than 140 creditors in the study took much more time than planned.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to sold the company at the end of 2009.
However, the sale to the undertakers had a few submissions among which no of them was ready to pay the amount of 2 billion more than the creditors were on research.
During this year, it was necessary to repeat when the MGM team began to work on a plan of repair which, after months of internal dealing and debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM is officially out of the failure in the following weeks, the Moelis and Cooper enterprises receive a number of million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1,2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who collected $375,000 per month for their business management services, will receive a 4 million "success premium".
Barber and Birnbaum account to restore the production of MGM, which only a single movie this year, and put on a yearly list of seven or eight films that would go out from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The study must conclude a difference between $265.000 and $275 million to finance its part in these two films, which must be performed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has approximately 18% of the MGM debt, tried to perform a combination of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main actor.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not reached an agreement.
Tech games to maintain your balanced budget
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful game of this year is the IPAD, maybe by Microsoft, Kinect video game system, both can make an important breach in your chad budget.
Consider that, for a iPad price, you can buy five BMX cars at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 corners to run a classic perles, or about 48 play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to maintain your balanced budget.
Recently, I visited three national players - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the email games I could buy for less than $80.
It is . It is that the Law de Moore has developed, the game of this year is able to have more power; but by costing the same price a little less, compared to the last year.
Moreover, while there are usually less new games associated with websites, two of the most with this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And Button Button Games are increasing, as well as reloadable piles games.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, except if contrary indication.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars for 3 years and more) are players in the size of an Indian coach that sing a note when you press them on the boat.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy a few of them, they will sing accordingly.
Warning: When you start pressing, you can't stop anymore.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspiring from Elmo Live's last year, the animation powder of 14 pounds plays role games like Simon Says and can dance Monday through its innovative arculated feet with blocking wheels.
Children who have tried the game use Mickey as dance instructor while their parents are worried about a lack of volume control.
If you're a kid of the 80s, you'll remember Al日e, one of the first educational games that are informed.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, 40 dollars for 3 years and more), with a douche filled with questionnaire cards designed to transform a car ball into a session with a self-correction and a bad car classer.
If you're wrong when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The Mobigo de VTech (60 dollars for the 3 to 8 years) is the lowest and easier to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster (70 dollars, for the 3 to 12 years), it is the first large revision of the Leapster Game, with a newer and more satisfying game.
No version is compatible with the old cards.
Fisher-Price iXL (90 dollars, for the 3-7 years) uses a iTunes type system to offer games and electronic books and is given to a SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for the 8 and more years) is a five-scale block greater than a rubber box, each has posed his own ارran LED.
The goal is to form words by putting online blocks before the time goes, it is ideal for an improving spell checker.
Moreover, games have a kind of online connection.
Only based on their presence in game stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a online company animal from the Penguin Club, for example, you can hold a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for the 6-12 years) which includes a marked piece of a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives sufficient credits to the Penguin magazine for two choice articles.
It can be acted with rockets or a company animal playing Puffle.
Lately bigger than the bottom of your teeth bridge, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years and more) is the last micro-robots with buttons.
The betious fausse is quickly moved on 12 vibrators in the casual directions.
It's amazing to make a block labyrinthe to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.

Take a niceer side to the maintenance of the order in China
Tang Shenbin arpens a place of the city as a city sergeant at the training by severely inspecting his nervous charges, by giving a lower order with a military authority.
He wanted that the female members of Chengguan, who were responsible for the public order in China, feared and disappointed for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence, transmit a certain impression to a spectator.
"Be right!"
"S percent!"
Show them, he said, "What do the beautiful girls say?"
Four girls who had lately passed the adolescence in white bottles, clothes of same colored clothes and garments of similar colors, were at the guard to you.
Four pairs of black tolerance, aligned with the rule.
Four hairs are perfectly highlighted because of the top of hair attached by a black and white cloud.
"Personally, I think they have a medium appearance," said Mr. Tang, with defeat.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to update the picture of citizen inspectors in China.
A city requested that all new recruits have a higher study diploma.
The province of Guangdong has changed the gris of uniforms against a more involved blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them by a strong way: in 2009, a report report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an incontrolable snack car by launching black looks, closely for a half-hour, until the colporteurs repair his business and part.
Xindu, a city district of 680 000 in Chengdu, chose to make a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district completed its street police in the middle of 13 women, especially selected for their appearance, their galb and their young age.
The idea is to give the police decrease one more deep, more female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to draw the look at this underground city brigade of China
And for the reason, the critics will say.
In contrast to the police, these agents are only authorised to comply with municipal orders by imposing amendments or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media depend on the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed a observer after he used his phone to film them by spreading a protest against a waste discharge.
Last year, a training manual for Pékin inspectors, discovered and online, describes how effectively win the criminals without emission of blood.
This year in Shanghai, a passenger was abandoned with a cerebral lesion after a bathroom with five officers.
A unpredicted video game of violence, available by online downloading, shows Chinese inspectors formed in the street sales.
"Chengguan marked the government," the last year, China Daily, a national publication, after a second polemic on taxes.
The magazine claimed a "complete cleaning".
Sceptics say that the approach is far away.
After the district had passed an announcement in October to find eight new female recurses, a editor, published in The Beijing Evening News, asked if women had real tasks or if they were only a tourist divertising.
The answer is a little of the two.
The district announcement requested female candidates, 18 to 22 years old, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five traits of the face in the right order".
They must have an average size of 1,6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 pounds.
Return to 26 years is obligatory.
The officers claimed that the work was too painful for women over 25 years.
"This is their image which is important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a nearly-governmental website.
"For the first time, the external quality of candidates will determine whether they agree; it is the size, weight, face traits, etc."
Then the temperature and the "internal qualitys".
The Chengguan women are like flower vessels, he said, "In addition to vessels, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, assistant director of the town district management office, does not belong to this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexs.
This is the case of the request relating to the order of the face traits.
That means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, handicaped or deformed persons must not postulate.
"We can't let a person drink or a boss come to serve here," Mr. Zheng said.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrographs on the place of Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old and has played games with a finely incurved mouth.
She does not consider the value of her appearance as a sexualist, said she.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" She asked for a disused air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old sheep, said, "Our work is to present the city's image."
They did not oppose their mandate to be limited, they said, because they feed greater carrier ambitions than simply throw the sellers into the streets where they were to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a twelve walking goods quickly moved to foot or steel, trying to sell as far as possible small bread or tofu bottles before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you have to go."
"We've already told you several times!" said Mrs. Xu while a seller fled away and temporarily abandoned his ship-carret to knives.
Agencies describe their functions rather than as an ardue monotons.
"This is almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, age of 20, who studies marketing after work.
"Green routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male authorizations to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report the contravenants to their superior men.
This aims to protect them from unfortunate public exposures of animosity against the Office that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the propagation of false voices which the Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
On one night, more than a twelve police officers and the Chengguan agents were hurt, 14 government vehicles were reversed or fired.
Xindu has gone to such a violence until here.
But calmness isn't well guaranteed.
Only two houses of the place of Baoguang, where female sex officers patrol this morning, more than 50 people gathered themselves at the street corner.
The agents confiscated a motor that was being prepared on the trottoir instead of in a magazine, as they imposed the regulation.
The motor owner cried to the scandale.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, at the left face, were scared of a coal road to their vehicle and were gone at all speed with the motor and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a co-ordinator attached to the man's team, remained behind, his white bathroom returned to hide his name.
Like female sex officers, 40-year-old co-ordinators are purely playing a support role.
In contrast with them, they are not formed in order to maintain an image created.
Sometimes, we're seriously.
"Parfous, we're doing it," Mr. said to him about a neutre.
"The most of the time, it's the public that starts."
Prosecutors will not include Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have raised the reports on Senator John Ensign, with a case related to an assistant of an ancient campaign and its efforts to make a lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced the Senator's lawyers on Thursday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat confronted by Mr. Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered as a possible republic candidate to the presidential of 2012 until the scandale around its case does not make the large national titles last year and hurt his career.
The Office of Mr Ensign stated that he was "very happy" by the decision, resulting from an exam of one year.
The Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senatoral Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign had no longer been subject to the question and that he had no intention to keep any accusation against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice has dismissed its comment on this matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise for many external ethics lawyers in the Ministry of Justice, which would have significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, in October 2009 in New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to → a lucrative lobbying work to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the case of the Senator with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a treasure during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funds to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they committed Mr. Hampton to make lobbying for them; -- documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an employer of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by the law to make lobbying with his former employer or Senat in his own.
Ethical experts supported the agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, in contrast with the prohibition of the turning door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made, " there is a primary evidence of a complot to violate and violate substantially the round door law," Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington, specialised in the defense of customers of an investigation by the Government.
Although the judge of the Ministry had explained the reasoning led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Ministry seemed to be dismissed by political persecutions after a number of high-level reversed by its section of the integrity, including the decisions taken last year to leave the persecutions against the former Senator Ted Stevens accused of prosecution.
The federal prosecutors feared to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, the Director-General of Citizens for responsibility and ethical responsibility in Washington, a defense group who received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-breaking government officers can now hold the laws not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main avocate of Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a follower on the next day, saying that the minister was not seeking accusations against his customer.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the Senator, as his office, reaffirmed him on Monday in a chair, had acted in law.
Mr. Coggins had determined the legal arguments he had made to the park.
"I am not able to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, but to say that we think they have taken the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Committee of Elections decided to leave an investigation after an independent complaint by the ethical group, supporting that the payment of 96.000 dollars by Mr. Ensign parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Committee stated that it had not sufficient evidence to prove that money was nothing but a gift.
NV Energy, a major company of Nevada who has long supported the Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
A email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company received Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's cabinet head, John Lopez, with Mr. Hampton and told him that he would "martel" the Ministry of the Interior on a litige question.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a breakfast with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the secretary of the transport to fix a meeting on behalf of the Air Company after the commitment of Mr. Hampton to make lobbying.
When the news of the case was overwhelmed last year, Mr. Ensign apologized his electors and sent off his leader post to the fourth Republic rang in Senata.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to carry out a third mandate in the Senat.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the goal of an investigation, his port-word, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator would hope that the Ethic Committee would quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign rejoices to continue his work in the name of the Nevada people, she says.
The call from Cheshire will point to Twitter
A half twelve of them were tapping away in the areas of the audience room.
They were sent every minute from a terrible testimony report via Twitter.
Finally, the defense said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the violation case and children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
Thursday, Steven J. Hayes' broadly followed procedure, which was recognized for the murder of three members of the Cheshire family, in the Connecticut, should stand at an official end where the judge would impose death penalty, voted by the jury.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already placed elements to the court that lose calls arguments that may take care of the courts for years.
What is caused is that the intense reporting on the process - as well as the generalized and extended use of Twitter journalists - have created a "cycle atmosphere ", a so extended and instinctive saturation with incendiary details that the jury was wrongly influenced by the public.
The request could motivate the call judges to discuss the question of whether new rules are required in the audience rooms.
"I have made the experience in this process; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of news in the audience rooms is reached by the rights of the person to a proper procedure," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer of Mr. Hayes, a lawyer.
The Court of Justice, Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of State, rejected the recruitment in the sentence of the last week, claiming that the media were "soundly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been urged by the passion.
But this is not the last word on the question.
Call courses have since decades that the median covering of notorial cases can be questioned about the equity of a process.
In a judgment of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States canceled the condamnation of a Osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for his wife's age, supporting in its decision that there was a " carnaval atmosphere in the process " due to media.
The crime is considered by some who have been the inspiration of television emission and the "Feiling" movie.
Some lawyers said that the Courts of Appeal to review a half centuries later the sentence of Mr. Hayes may be careful because of the argument which new rules could be necessary to manage the means of communication of audience rooms, unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"It is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new medias" in the major envelopment procedures, said John J. Donohue III, a teacher at the Droit of Stanford, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report which was arbitraryly applied.
Professor Donohue states that some calling judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the instantious communication from audience rooms could allow more justice.
The case of Twitter is only one of the many other words described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which may be discussed for years, which takes time for the implementation.
Defense lawyers, for example, claim that Mr. Hayes would have suffered a damage when the Court of Blue allowed them to test the reactions of the possible jury by showing them macabre photos of scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jury said that the victims' photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and his daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defense lawyers claim that they will also comply with the constitutionality of death penalty and that they will support that the judge has unjustly expelled one of the jury, which had been critical to the prosecutors, and that he has abusely pressed for a verdict by making the decision to bring the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jury has not been sequestrated.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense median cover of the process could be the largest source of interest.
They noted in a contest against the verdict last month that the case was dominating the median scene in the Connecticut and that it was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates at the Governing Board and at the United States Senate.
They maintained that the informatic media did not stop taking the flames of the case's emotion.
"The daily busculade of the media, cameras and journalists before the palace of justice," writes the lawyers, "nothing of what was previously seen here, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national scale."
Their accent on the cover of the Twitter system is controversed.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the statement, which the new instantians were more intense than the more slowly made, was a popular view that would open the Court's policy governing the median coverage of future proceedings.
However, some lawyers said that calling courses were often attached by the arguments that social and social changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hayes insist on this recruitment.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which had violated Dr. Sheppard's condemnation due to the median coverage of the proceedings, and they indicated that they would call on the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," wrote they," representative of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21th century. "
Can civility approach the clivages?
After a campaign marked by the invectivity and the negativity, a minimum of civility extended to Washington this week.
Is this a sign of a real bi-partial cooperation to the front or an illusionary moment before the quick return to the party fight in the capital?
The Thursday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congrès has not been sentenced on the major issues to be treated during the "boiteux canard" session.
However, there was at least a political discussion on the differences of the two parties and on the importance of their shared responsibility to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The Thursday meeting of the Committee on the Deficit of the President was also civilized, despite the political differences remaining among the members.
It is that the heavy interaction of several months has made a mutual respect transcendency of the ideological fosse; but who still shares the members.
It is not enough to say that a new ear of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of trial and mutual trial for the signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to evaluate the limits of the opinion and patience of electors for a renewed partial war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the later comments of the participants have shown a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a quick climate change in the past two years.
The fact that taxability, expenditure, health care or rights remains in thousands of distances.
However, the election of November had modified Washington at least in the short term.
"It does not doubt that things have changed on the ton," said Pete Wehner, a officer of Bush, now next to the Ethical and Public Policy Centre.
"It is inevitable after elections.
Elections arise from partisans and then exhaust.
That's good."
On certain issues, in particular on the agenda of the "boiteux canard" session, the Republicans and the Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
The two parties want to find a way to preserve a part or in it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is intended on the extension of unemployment allocations, not only because the republicans can not be allowed to make the impression that they are in favour of the reductions of taxes for the rich, while paying unemployed taxes to workers without employment.
At the Thursday meeting at the White House, more optimism plans on a possible agreement on issues raised during the "boiteux canard" session with the ratification of the "New START" package.
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institute, warns that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily reduce a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress will meet in January.
Instead of this, he said, a period of disagreement is lasting, even inevitable.
"When the things that have to be done will be, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed its broadly shared skepticism, which would lead to true cooperation.
"I think most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-spectacle or shadow-boxing in comparison to the 2012 main event, he said.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new majority of the Republic to the Chamber and the electors of the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be at the height of their promises to reduce the costs and to abrogate the new law on health care.
These partial positions are currently and already in the first reactions to the Deficit Committee's recommendations that include reforming the tax code and acquiring certain taxes, repealing the age of retraite and reducing the expenditure.
President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, themselves, questioned the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the Committee, composed of 18 members, to make their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been difficult to reach that number.
The biggest resist is among the elections of the group, which suggests that there is a few reasons for fiscal issues, at least today.
Galston provides two phases in the fight between the White Maison and the Republic of the Congrès.
The first will come in the next year in the form of partnerships, since the republicans are responsible for Obama's budget, tax and health care; then they will be followed by a larger bi-partial cooperation period.
What would be the cause of change?
That's the opinion.
It is widely evident that, despite the partisan mind of the recent election, most Americans always want to see the two workshops.
If the comparison leads to an impasse, such as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe public reactions.
He who will be deemed to be lost must change the head and find compromises.
However, it would be a optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and the polyarisation are greater today than they were in the midst of 1990s and there is a greater ideological distinction between Obama and the Congrès Republics than then between President Bill Clinton and the Republic.
At the same time, soldiers of the two parties see 2010 as a simple prejudice to a more consistent election in 2012.
With regard to this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more effort from the two parties to find a hearing area on the issues that still share them.
US Divulgued documents describe Moscow as a hair of corruption
The town's control is within the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and has passed to Kremlin a part of the vineyards and the protection money it collectes, reported the United States' ambassade in Russia in a fev note.
The police and the Federal Security Service perform great rackets that contribute to explain the high cost of life in Moscou, said.
They collect money not only of financing companies but also of organised groups.
Each board of the bureaucracy - what the Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine called the "Vertical of the power" - takes part of it while the money goes to the top of the scale.
The service note, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassadeur John Beyrle, was placed on Monday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources which the names have been exposed.
It was edited while Jouri Loujkov was still Master of Moscow, and he is largely responsible for corruption.
In October, President Dmitri Medvedev was conceived, but there have been little cleaning tracks since.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a first-plan building company, have always denied corruption during the years; and he has gained several diffusion processes.
In September, he said what is followed by a Russian TV chain, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: "It's foolish, it's to throw, it's all."
The Russians believe, in an exciting majority, that their society is corrupt; · the reviews.
But it is appropriate to find the information listed in an ambassador account, and it is unusual to conceive that it would be to diplomates of a foreign country to do it.
The direct link between the Government of Moscou and the criminality led some people to the name of "disfunctional" and to claim that the Government worked more as a cleptocracy than a government," the note of the ambassade.
"The elements play a " crisha " (term used in the world 日el/la mafia, which literally means " toit " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior (MVD) and the Office of the Procurer, and through the entire Office of the Government of Moscou.
"The analysts of identifying a structure at three levels in the Moscow world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the miles are at the second level."
"End, the Corrupt Inspectors and Corrupt Inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which the groups compose an empty in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB breathes the money of the largest companies and that the police goes to the small ones.
A source, said he, "explained that Moscow business owners realized that it was preferable to protect MVD and FSB (only organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more and more power than the groups, but they are also protected by the law. "
"This is why the request for protection by the gangs is no longer so high."
The note indicates that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be unbalanced; even those paying are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay rapidly see their business closed under a pretext or another.
Medvedev has expressed the fight against corruption several times but has admitted a little progress.
The note of the ambassador translates the accounts of men who offer values, probably full of money, until Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrates," said in a recent interview of Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" of Moscou.
"But he is part of this office."
"It is not part of a political class because it doesn't exist in Russia."
Without political, without opposition, without separating powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the costs of corruption would be over 300 billion dollars per year at the entire scale of Russia.
The country was classified in a recent investigation on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental Transparency International (the countries are classified at least the most corrupt).
The divulgation of the American Ambassade's note, which was not realized just last night, Moscou's time, will be sure of mistakes within the Russian Government; although Loujkov could be blamed in a certain way for Moscou's failures, that could be the opportunity for Kremlin to show that it is going to solve the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Poutine issued the hypothesis that WikiLeaks' documents would be a manufacture and reacted with anger before the proposals that the United States diplomates had developed by calling Batman and Reproching Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem answers the fact that this is our interaction, the important factor of the internal policy in this country, says he.
"But to be honest with you, we don't doubt that it would be done with such an arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethical."
The former fighters of the Red Khmers obligated to face the past
In a bad-lighted class room with walls in beton decrepted by bad quality, the director of the secondary oil of Anlong Veng called the man who built it, the last head of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"All of us here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he cared for his people," Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as the "boot" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of older Khmers Red in the northwest of Cambodia, where he made hospitals, ponds and other infrastructures; and where thousands of ancient soldiers of the organization live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers returned to the Government, the long-term loyalty is finally released in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the Government distributed a high school manual that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Khmers to the children of his former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly governed with the United Nations, declared his first sentence on an ancient member of the Red Khmers, condemning, at 35 years of prison, the former leader of the famous trial center of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known under the name of "Duch".
Before this development of the situation, anxiety increased with the elderly fighters of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng; complying with the efforts to reconciliate and their desires to reintegrate in the Cambodian society.
"There are feelings and fears among the elders of the Red Khmers but they are imputing to do whateverever," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodge Documentation Centre, an independent agency who conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions in the family."
Under the Kingdom of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1,7 million people have been exhausted or died of famine, disease or overcome.
When the Vietnamese invaded and reversed the Government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and his army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that took place until the last of the movements occurred in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerilla of their base in the west mountains of Cambodge and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of 1990, after a United Nations peace agreement led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of Rhode Khmers fighting began to defeat the Government, covering the Ieng Sary chapters in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died by natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had been headed, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for his proceedings.
Without their benefits, most of the ancients fighting red khmers have fallen in the black middle, common to the rural regions of Cambodge; and many remain nostalgic.
Although some red khmers elite officers have kept their posts of local manager in exchange for their weapons, it is not qualified farmers at low grade and dossier.
"These people have benefited very little after the chapter," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation that organizes public forums in all Cambodge, including Anlong Veng.
"They are immigrated by the Utopic Agricultural Ideology of the regime."
"They have been highlighted in a framework where business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, age 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fighted in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he was installed in 1998 as a poor rice cultivator.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"It's the lunch that everyone eat."
But now, life is difficult because we must submit to our own needs."
The current Red Khmers court also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of the next year, the court should begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister Khmer red.
The mandate of the Court is to judge the high leaders and the main responsible for crimes, but he did not say if he continued beyond these four cases.
It would need more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The last median speculations turned to Im Chaem, age of 64, an ancient district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the Rhode Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Cambodge Documentation Centre that she had monitored the construction of Trapeang Thma bargage, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a torry evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his house of wood on pilots, on a land road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun was casting long shadows on the wheat, Im Chaem was talking about his past in the Red Khmers.
If the court had called her, she said she would have gone.
"The Cambodge is in peace and stability," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defeated the Red Khmers in 1978, also warned several times that an instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historicals respond to this.
"The Cambodge must cross a shot and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is everything Cambodge has to do to go before, said Youk Chhang, from the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in terms of khmer is to reconnect the cassed songs," he said.
"We must put these songs into rubber so that we can understand."
The center produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Red Khmers, "A story of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as additional to the historical handbooks of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
Like most of the Cambodia, Anlong Veng youths only know some details about the Red Khmers, despite the town's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, age 19, studying at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new manuel helped students to understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the handbook and the court," he said.
"They deceive because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the process of complex and difficult reconciliation, said Sok Leang.
But the public fore, the handbook and the court begin to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmers keep a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a road, invaded by the bad herbs and spent plastic sacks, led to a black sugar rectangle, covered by a round toilet.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pneumatic pile after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, age of 31, mobile phone seller on road border, said that she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants are going to pray," she says.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day she planned to go to the last place of rest of Pol Pot where she would leave a bucket of mature bananas in the hope of bringing the chance.
Belarus accepts refusing its military quality stock
The Government of Belarus announced on Thursday that he would leave his stock of raising highly rich, a key component for nuclear weapons; this decision is included in the framework of a surprised victory of President Obama's campaign to ensure nuclear materials throughout the world.
The agreement was published in a joint party after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met the Belarusian Foreign Affairs Minister, Sergei Martynov, on the basis of a summit of security.
The American Government had tried for years to convince the Belarus to reject the ura highly enriched and seemed to have dismissed the horizon at the last time.
But the American responsibles stated to Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus during the last two months to eliminate 187 books of the military quality ura from a research center of Belarus.
This has opened the way to a Thursday agreement to eliminate the rest of the material of about 500 books, a officer who claimed the condition of anonymate because of the question.
The Agreement is one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Supreme of 47 nationals, organized at Obama's initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic after the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Supreme of 2012 nuclear security."
"This proves me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the World Safety Party, a group of nuclear security promotion.
Clinton qualified the "deeply significant, important step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama engaged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials throughout the world in the next four years.
Since then, the American Government has helped six countries to dismiss themselves from all their enrichies.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A twelve countries did it under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Supreme on the Nuclear Security of Obama, the Belarus president, Alexandre Loukachenko, said that the nation would never reject his ura.
"We have kept highly rich, hundreds of kilograms of what is mainly of military quality and lowly enrichi ura," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to make salt bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We'll use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus has been reported from the United States a few months ago, however, by showing interest to reach an agreement.
The first operation to eliminate the Ur of Belarussia in October was particularly complicated because the maternal was practically irradiated, indicated the responsibles.
It was loaded on a special train that parked over 1 300 miles up to an installation in Russia to be stored and eliminated, indicated responsibles.
The second operation has been completed on Monday and has been carried out by aeroplane, responsible.
The American Government spent 13 million dollars in its efforts, in large part, to replace the research facilities of Belarusia with lowly enriched; unadaptated for weapons.
"One and a minute organization have been implemented in order to strengthen confidence," thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a responsible for the Department of Energy Specialized in the World Minement.
According to the estimates of the Nonproliferation Centre James Martin, the Belarus had at least 88 books of military quality, as well as hundreds of kilos of ura highly enrichi.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks from here to 2012, a common statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tendered for years, mainly because of the hard repression by Loukachenko des Human Droits.
But the statement of Thursday would suggest a potential renewal.
"All by welcomeing the progress on these global security issues, the United States and the Belarus recognized that a greater respect for democracy and the Dreits of Humans in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The Government has not issued any objection to the flights of ✔
The Government did not make any objection to the flights of the Flight with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo through the Spanish territory, a telegram of the United States ambassador in Madrid.
This is shown by the documents filtered by Wikileaks in the El País daily, which implies that the first president of the Government at that time, Mary Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested the Spanish Exectitive to be informed to "demonstrate that they exercise adequate supervision on foreign aircrafts that passed by Spain".
In June 2006, after a report from the Council of Europe which was complicated in practices contrary to human rights to a twelve countries, among whom Spain, a meeting occurred between the former northern American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of Vega.
The President recognized that the Council's report "is surprised the Government of Zapatero outside the game" and insisted on the fact that Spain had nothing to hide.
"The Vega highlighted that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights above the Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to avoid "prefering them to the depourvu," Aguirre reports in a cab.
The holder of the Ministry of External at that time, Miguel Angel Moratinos, reported to the ambassador that the Spanish Excipient "will give this the lower profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence."
In its turn, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted the Ambassade the fact that he would not lock the initiative of the judge to request the declasification of the documents of the National Centre of Intelligence (CNI) and the Defence Minister on Flights of the §.
"These reports contain no inevitable elements, no sensitive information," explained the Abassade after talking to the prosecutor.
The United States have shown their concern for "the appearance of the Spanish Judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declasified information of the CNI or the Defence Minister.
"This will comply with our efforts between independent researchers to handle the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre denied.
In March 2007, during a breakfast between the United States ambassador and the Ministry of the Internet, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are very zealous of its independence and will do what they consider proper," he had given instructions to his employees "to avoid the comments of a flaming retoric, trying to distort the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his concern for the action of the PP in this case.
"Despite its general orientation pro-American, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take part of any indication that Zapatero's Government tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative impacts on the Government of the United States," she reports.
The parâide that passed to the beasts was plagued on the "acc" network to be a mother
The young girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terreur to the gallian"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this surname she used since she was small, she was with a cousin and at least one friend; the two origins of Noah, the village of the Coruña whose origin is.
The messages are issued from 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his emotional life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' witnesses.
The 30-year gallian girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tuñez, industrial.
Their relationship was a year.
Soon after they were separated, we knew she was hungry.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new little friend after that.
The elu was Alberto, a young man of Lousama, a neighborhood.
With him, she was co-associated for a long time.
Caesar had v ́d with them.
When the young girl went to the Baleare Islands for the work market, the young man stayed with her partner, who even joined her a week in Palma.
But the content of its communications, it's heard that their idyle was fractured, they separated themselves.
On March 2008, she was located in Minorque, alone, and wrote, "Alberto is very strange and victorious for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I said to him, it made him a good thing, but, of course, he now considers what it means to be with the child all day and does not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received, "I want you to come back this month or you give me a address to send the child to you."
She claims, "If she doesn't like it, let him leave the boy with my mother, and I will take it when I come back," she cried.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I'm going, but I'll stay there only until 19, because at 20 I'm going to be present to a job to not lose it."
She explains that if everything was fine, she would have taken her old man with her.
"He will remain with the right person, which is with me, and I will never leave it from my life with another person if this person is not my mother," a doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she tapped it, it is supposed that the child, who came to the island on the 1st of that month, was probably dead.
"Cesar is happy on one side, but he is not of another."
"One side he's with me, and this place likes him a little, but one else he's going to the oil almost every day."
She is talking about a movement to ork.
"The kid will be there at a few hours of age, and how I'll get some money from the baby-sitter."
On 17th, salutations and complaints.
"A very big bishop from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto said he sent you, I don't know what videos to the mail, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child's good, he's going at the sea hours to make the catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm ahead of money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her in the MySpace Universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the freedom of prison."
"Terreur to Galician (epigraphe)."
The latest man who has vowed with her, watch, he says his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened so she didn't tell her the fact that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial penitentiary of Palma yesterday from the center of Judician prisoners from Minorque.
The officer advocate, Carlos Maceda, explained that she didn't remember how the facts had passed, "and she didn't even have the intention of doing bad to the minor."
Before she had acknowledged that Caesar had shooted in the bathroom and put her body in a valise.
Defense and the prosecutor have requested a psychiatric test.
The members of the Popular Party would win 4 seats in the Congrès and the PSC would lose them 9
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be determined in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona municipalities.
According to the significant increase of votes and Members recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already mentioned the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training receives in these double comics normally the one that it receives in the catalogues.
Thus, Catalan populations received 610.473 votes to the generals of 2008, while the 2006 autonomys received it 316.222.
On Monday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this growing trend is maintained, desired to distort the PSC votes and the reliability of the PP electorate, the analysis of this training calculated that if there were general elections, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 members in the Congrès, while the CIU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would not lose it, if there were general elections (in 25).
These calculations would find that the catalan place is PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the population, ERC would lose a Member - he has three now - while ICV would keep a member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda remains, the next meeting would be held in May 2011 for municipal committees, where people may also be determined at the end of the socialist hegemonium in the four capitals of the province and in their relations to the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulate the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
As the nationalists and the people agree that the PSC could lose Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not even get the possibility of returning to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debt, it would not be fantastic that this training loses its representation in Barcelona Maastricht - it is needed to have 5% of the votes.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist master, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only recorded a difference of 500 votes in comparison with PSC, whereas the Mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they have been found several times.
Populars have also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalogue and encourages to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has easily easiered thousands of passengers in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three
The seven Pakistanians and the Nigerian detained by the General Commissioner for the Information of the Police of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigres for the Liberation of the Terre Tamil" and "Lakar e Taiba" (Let), the last author of Bombay's attendants who caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internes has granted great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that with the "operation of Kampai" the Al Qaida Implementation Appartement on international level and "hereafter, its operational capacity".
Researchers calculate that the cell, during which it was active in Catalogue, has been able to send thousands of passengers to Thailand, or they were eligible and then distributed to groups that integrate the galaxie → Al Qaida so that its "conflicters" can pass the European borders and other Western countries with a total impunity.
The demantaled cell is not the only one that the Jihadist network was operating in Europe, so that in research, other European police units, other than Thailand services, have participated in other European police units, so in the European Union's territory, there may be the following days of similar coups as those who were recorded on Monday evening in Barcelona.
Inside this operation (the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Aticurr Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand were held another, with the capture of the Pakistanians Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thailandian Syriana Kijbum.
They were those who managed from Bangkok the implanted cell in Spain and other European countries.
The catalan network - whose part was struck in 2009 - was mainly flying from tourists the passports that satisfyed the conditions indicated by the World Islamic Framework.
This means the documents to be on behalf of youths between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without printed visions.
Researchers highlight that until now, no detail was found to connect prisoners in Catalogue with the expectation of Bombay, even if the author of this attack, "Lakar e Taiba", was one of the receptor groups of passengers held in Spain and post-qualified in Thailand.
However, it is necessary to recall that a few days before this attention was made, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency of a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards used after the "command" integrants who killed 106 people.
The police had a lot of documentation.
PP requests to suspend tax complication
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity to expose his personally in Artur Mas his conditions to support its investment as the President of the Generality, identical to those exposed during the campaign, which reassured to give priority to the recovery of the economy and lack of philosopheral aventuries as the economic complexity that the nationalist leader wants to address to the half of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan Populars arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that provides that 18 members have received the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to love it, because the CU candidate needs only one of the trainings that will absten in the vote of the investment.
The future covenants that nationalists want to maintain in the Congrès during general elections, but for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are in the catalyst key.
With regard to the President of the PP, to support a investment "the removing all the sovereignist and independent talks" and the economic complication - similar to that of the Netherlands - that the leader convergence wants even to submit to the referendum.
The two leaders commonly have their own in order to enhance the political apparatus of a very exagered autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successes and donations.
The detail of the negotiation on the investment of Mas will take care of the PC, Jordani Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a strong opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and now he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Geriatric states that the dead have not been given to "no measures"
The owners of the Olot Centre do not eliminate the possibility that their owner of night killed more than 11 elderly
The responsibility of the Geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused by the institution’s conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the infimmier who killed at least 11 elderly persons who were responsible in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the Centre, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's wish would be the ability to execute the accusation against the responsible" for the dead but "the ability and responsibility involves us to cope with the processual situation of civil responsibilities".
In addition to the social discrimination that the entity can suffer in order to have not detected timely the activity of the night immortality, the great threat to the Carity now takes the form of an important compensation that the parental representatives of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime date of the 2009 ago and that since that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhibition of eight bodies - ancient patients in the geriatric - which he doubted that in many cases no doctor would personally exploit the dead but, given the age and pathology of the patients, the formality had occurred by phone.
The Caritat, through its director, rejected this situation categoryly yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures could not have been the cause of what happened at any time".
The lawyer of La Caritat said, "In this case there is only an injury indication of any other person who is not accused."
The person already baptized as "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 years ago and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 to 2009, and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In that case, he caused him to die by injecting him a overdose of insulin, other than the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pastills.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned that it is complicated to control the access of the staff from the centre to the doctors.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktail were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the infimmier, in his desire to delay the sufffrance of the internal, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analysis will clarify if Vila doesn't lie by saying that he looked for his first victims a less cruel death or otherwise he burned them inside by giving them lessive as he already admitted that he did with the three women he killed in the 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night infirmer, not even the number of approved persons, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number to be greater and justify their attitude by the various versions given by Vila in its visits to the First Instance Court and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after having done eight successfully.
That is why they say that they will remain available to justice in order to clarify the facts.
ECB's threat
Investors reacted brushedly to Trichet's yesterday threat, which warned that "the markets should not underestim our reaction capacity."
The various devices have been closed to the force and the actions of the European banks have increased more than 5%.
However, we should not even underestimate the ability of the ECB to be thrown, and the euro has not been recorded increasingly, which is an anxious signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, in the same way that it goes, it recovers, but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB has quoted us today to take liquidity measures and it will be tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining.
Bundesbank requested the conclusion of the debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures and allowing only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures are extended "at least to March" and maintain the sale to trimestrial businesses to unlimited access to the end of the trimester to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the obligation buying programme and that we will even give the signal of intensifying it.
If they do not comply with the generated expectations, they will reverse the great reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to increase to reduce the liquidity measures, God helps us!
Like during their meeting in May, when they claimed that they did not even consider the purchase of obligations and the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and sustainable.
In May he announced the baseoka Monday and Thursday he said he had already bought a lot, providing a new shopping on the market.
I've been very poor in Portugal.
The Treasur was only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous full.
Even so, the types in Portugal decreased 30 basic points throughout the corbe, and considering a change in market feeling after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the numbers of the Allied and Bank of Ireland were held.
The estimated numbers represent 10,000 million short-term and 15.000 potential and have a time-limit for the private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no creditability after he has not detected the problem in July with the stress test, the numbers are acceptable in the Assistance Plan and are helped to reduce incertitude.
However, on Monday next, the Government will have to approve the Parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel modered the ton of his speech to release the pressure before the next Summary of the Government Chairs and Government on 14 December, where it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are a union and that we all interpret the same party.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the happiness of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve Friday.
Reform pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment are responsible for investors' audiences such as Vivaldi's four samples.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Bourse has increased 4.5%, the dual of the rest of the European Bourses.
On the contrary of Fev, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was quickly and radical, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key to a three-year obligation that will be benefited by the Effect Trichet, so we hope that this will react with a strong request and help to dismiss doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Aid Plan, it would be a self-immunisation.
They would give us a liquidity line which we don't need, the Treasur has more than 40,000 million in liquidity, the triple compared to March, very dear types and they cut access to the undead markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be the one of Caesar's wife, "unless it appears."
Courage, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will answer the Vega Sicilia Council requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, because he considers him "null of right", the judge of El Enebro on the next 16th, requested by five of his seven sons, in which they will try to make their majority valid and to engage in Bodegas Vega Sicilia's management bodies.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joshua provide their batteries for the new chapter of their litigation for the control of one part of the group.
The larger holder of business services for companies does not seem to be ready to cease in his litigation to be present in El Enebro's directional bodies.
It was excluded by five of his seven sons who were nominated to the Actionary Assembly of 18 January that year in which the contest was registered in the Trade and Society Register.
The Jury Council of El Enebro for the next 16, convocated by the Machistrat Commercial 2 of Madrid, opened the toner box again in the Alvarez family.
The court to fix the assembly is the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly until the conflict is repeated.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperated resource from the applicants of his five sons to try, through a processual argument, in fraud and injury of the Law, to validate and correct the assembly radially no on 18 January", and its official passwords.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly is once, to be contested, considering that it is "null of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discrete silence, have already tried without success that the judge calls a convention in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other actives, the sons of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the requested service group benefited from 51% of the capital, family protocols.
This is the question of the fund that the judge must decide after the audience on the request of contestation for which there is not yet a date notified.
Red Bull triomph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software grows in improvements on real-time cars.
Since Red Bull entered the world in Form 1 in 2004, his history in this selective universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At the first time, no one took into account the options of a new darkness that came to pass, despite the rising trajectory of the last samples, last November, in the last phase of the championnat, they all passed on Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without buying the ability as a pilot of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, not even the ability of Renault engine that propulses his car, in the world of Form 1 it speaks of the "secret weapons" that the multinational company Siemens put in Red Bull's hands to transform it into a winner team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very remote goals from the higher automobilistic competition.
The named PLM, this powerful informatic instrument was used to create assembly chains of all manufacturers, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, simulate the product or process faithfully before building it in a real way, thus avoiding deficiencies and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon photo apparatus, Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous Nissan utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Industrial Division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this information instrument in Form 1 has allowed Red Bull to create and exhibit "in few hours, almost in real time", changes, changes and improvements detected during courses and tests.
Ruswurm explains that the lights of 1992 had a average of 10 technicians in their teams that could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team works now with 180 high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful informatic equipment, analyze and design such changes on bolds.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of Red Bull balls except the engine, which is responsible for Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodinamic and safety elements are changed.
Changes may be passed from the reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, using advanced production systems by lazer and high-cleves.
As a single limitation of this crash of perfection, there are 40 million dollars that each team in Form 1 may cost as a limit for each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull implanted the high tool to create and produce its balls in a local 50 miles from London.
These are two bathrooms where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything happens there's "top secret".
The staff for this debt accounts 580 people, there are two pilots, the Vettel campion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Form 1 is certainly the recent Sebastian Vetell campion.
Among the large resources that the brand of energy drinks has set in the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, with which the activity is inestimable and notoriality.
The director of the machine, Steve Nevey, states that five years ago it could be said that the progress of R+D in the case of course cars was 50% of the winners and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and the representation represents 85% of the success, while the drivers bring 15% of the value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webber will never be replaced by the informal, because " they're an impressed gladiators".
HP日a in two years 20 own magazines with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated in Barcelona his first exclusive magazine with its associated Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 market network between 80 and 100 metres squared which the multinational provides in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-mark centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The HP president of Spain, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the remuneration magazine on the Grand Via de Barcelone, the property of Pont Reyes, with which it has been 30 years old.
The North American group prepared a plan to implant 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first opens were the members of Bucarest (Romany) and hranrade (Serbia) last week, which was the third of Barcelona.
Herrero didn't want to reveal the next possible magazines, even if she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The HM personal system guide has ensured that the philosophy for the planting of stocks will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive mobile of magazines (with products that can be interactively touched) which will have the same image in Europe.
Furthermore, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and highlighted that the exclusive trade network was "building the services offered to customers and MMEs in purchasing, assistance, post-wind and even packaging".
The Barcelona magazine includes a space with a worldwide pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP information equipment in guarantee.
A online service connected to a technology center in Maastricht (Holand).
"And in 10 minutes, we can solve problems that often can take even two days."
"This system is designed especially for MPEs and users, because large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," he noted in the past, Helena Herrero.
Sabadell is on 'flying' a million clients in its towns in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the Delegated Administrator of Banko Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the employment sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war.
Despite this, it provides a fraction of interest margins, which will be tried to share with the increases of the committees and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to catch a million individual customers in three years, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit during the three future years and has been able to survive in a very complex economic environment.
The bank will run in 2011 a new director plan that will maintain a three-year ability.
The objective, rather than surviving without the need to take FROB's subventions, is to win a market quota by capturing a million new customers - 700,000 if those who can get out of the bank - his great task to be made, since this bank has even been more acquired of the SMEs and companies than the customer.
This year he received 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 companies.
Its marketing cost to individuals is 3.5%, while it is over 10% in companies.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the comparison on productivity, or that is the same thing, of the outermost, with the reduction of costs as a goal, which will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Small banks are currently able to set objectives and make them quick, since the financial crisis has deteriorated all the plans of the world holding sector.
Sabadell, actually, will end this year with its plan of director Optima, established four years ago, even if the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation determined its prolongation for a further exercise.
The customers who let the boxes go away will be its main goal.
Pengt; a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted on the fact that 2011 will be a "difficulty and transcendental year".
The exhaustive, actually, thinks that the outcome of the crisis in Spain will be "late."
Moreover, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is essential for the survival of the business.
And even if he thinks that the war of the halt - which penalises the margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and cashs pay for its emissions for liquidity are already moved to the credit price for the loss of margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is equal and will be a credit pressure factor."
"We haven't locked the robet, but the differences are higher," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and to increase the price of differentials - see FincoDias of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the tendance of the Educational Sector is now "the committees" but " there is a competitive framework".
The Governing Board of Sabadell is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not wrong that he ensures that Spain "we will be asked for greater dimensions."
"All will move next year," he assured.
He claims that capital needs "seenly" and some Spanish financial entity could enter into red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in receipt of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After having assured that Sabadell could survive at the time of market closure, he decreased the importance of the fact that some holders already predicted as a new liquidity crisis.
He notes that it cannot be issued, but in contrast with what happened in June, the short-term funding can be financed through rest, which reduces the crisis.
CECA rejects the possibility of a second weight of fusions between boxes
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of a new vague of shopping boxes yesterday and again insisted on the speed with which the sector revolve.
When the process of concentration of Spanish boxes started, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of production of this new vague of operations yesterday.
"I think the largest part of the fusions has been performed, it cannot be said that Cajasol's integration in the Banca Civica group is a second phase, it's adjustments."
"The majority has been completely performed; it is possible that instead of 17 to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been performed under the bank of Spain, which has also performed much in this operation," stressed the leader.
In the statements during a short-term of the Association of Directors and Excipients of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta expressed that the concentration process is "with the greatest speed possible and we must be very satisfied by the way it is fulfilled in the past periods, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
"The transition of 45 boxes with a average of 28.500 million actives at 17 with 75.500 million is an unbalanced procedure in the history, reducing the number of units by 62% so that they are much larger to be in accordance with Bael," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta recognized that there are a number of very little happy opinions on the process lanter that show "a lack of seriousness and sense" because "what the Spanish Bank does is reminding that we must respect the time before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, guaranteed yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and the "profession" of the world, and he attributed to people who doubt that it is "no knowledge".
The leader mentioned that since the current economic conjoy, "We can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and boxes, a system that has started a "very important" concentration process and "go to the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish Sector was well taken out of stress tests that the ECB made in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but he has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Markets pressures caused a double government response.
On the other hand, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which varied from tax reductions for SMEs, the regulation of private movement agencies or the elimination of 426 euros of aid to unemployed unemployment contribution to the privatization of 49% of the AENA, the management of the Airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former President Felipe González, agreed with the critics of the Channel Angela Merkel on its responsibility to deal with the current crisis.
How should we interpret these moves?
It is necessary to mention that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its political policy.
In contrast, it is another restriction to the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And there, Germany has a radically new vision of what must be its future, which chokes with that of maintaining the former traditions of most of its partners.
With regard to European resistance, in Germany we are starting to spy on the three possible crisis outcomes.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary area.
The second is the recovery of Mark, even if this is now of the science of fiction, with a very favourable opinion, about 50% of the population.
Third, a new conception of the euro, online with the German proposals for a greater macroeconomic control, budgetary strict control, amendments to countries translating them, possible suspension of payments from one of them and the private sector of possible adjustments.
The German position has been determined and it has long been defined, therefore now there is no place for excuses.
In addition, in 2009, when both the European Commission and FMI stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought that we should do (taking plans and stability of funds) and what its European partners, France, practiced.
The second course of the Central European Country was when Merkel was difficult to extend the decision to save Greece.
Since this time, she has made a famous critical, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the opinion and the emphasis was against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, at the end of October, Merkel again expresses a positive position, requesting the reform of the Treaty of the Union to enable the rescue of a country and to bind private assets to support a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, because it predicted the Irish crisis and the rest.
However, its proposal, despite a little edulcorated, was approved and, in the following months, we should assist the reform process of the Union which makes these measures possible since 2013.
Germany tracked a red line that she doesn't think to cross.
And she tells us everyone that, even though now we need to take measures with which we cannot be too agreed, from that date the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries translating rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be able to declare payment stops and, in this case, the private sector will also support a part of the costs.
Germany indicates that we must follow a severe growth path with high levels of spending and investment, moderation in consumption, improvement in productivity and competitiveness and positive external sales.
A alternative based on the debt and construction, with big payment balance, such as the presidency of the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will not be simply tolerated.
It's rough.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not only to re-reduce the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we ask is much harder.
And what it absolutely doesn't have to do in these circumstances is to get us to face ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will come to us a greater tranquillity.
And let us know what opportunity we have been given until 2013.
The President Zapatero also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the Saturday with the large enterprises and the announcement of the new measures yesterday) suggested that, despite Merkel's critics, it was opened the road to the tess to be ordered to the house.
But the red line that Germany tracked is there, and they do not move it.
And among the possibilities to be considered, it is not possible to be excluded to leave a too severe monetary area of small countries.
And in that case, Germany can always tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraude of the law
The Russians similar to the Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the enemy but not the will of escape from a sanction.
The earlier exposure in principle by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the festival of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions Ligue has made a lot of increasing on the anti-sport character of such behaviour and if the two players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match ended (their team was already winning), the two players decided to lose time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitr to show them the second yellow carton.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will end by being leader of his group, both players will perform the regulatory sanction during the next match of the bargage match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the EUFA discipline committee sanctionsed with two matches the team entrepreneur, José Mourinho and different economic amounts to players involved.
The provocation of a yellow carton in circumstances like that or similar is not a new practice, but rather often in the world of football.
It is so extended that it is part of etos, non-scripted rules, but followed by this sport.
A part of the debate in the case reported must be the fact that this was a protagonist of the Real Madrid entity team (which in his hymne shows nobleness and honour and in past occasions condemned an amend to its players for similar acts) and an orchestrated dramatization, by Mourinho, which has a more episode to his historic and provocant history.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behavior is not explicitly prohibited by the regulation against the sports principles, namely if it is committed with these actions a violation of law; because they are, in fact, acts respectable with the sports regulation, but are electing its sense.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause sports.
One of the goods that understand the sports mind is the integrity of the adverse players, an aspect that with these actions has not been in danger, that is, it has not been a violent game.
Another of these goods that we are doing with the right game is avoiding that the team of criminal players benefits in a wrong way of the opposite team, which is not even the case.
However, the paradoxal fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not accept that it is normally characterized as a trickery or fraction of the law, because its violation of rules has not been performed in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has exactly tried to be the most evident possible for the penalisation of the arbitre.
They waited and voluntaryly accepted the sanction.
Another question is the type of advantage that the criminals receive from the intentional errors being examined.
Here is necessary to find out that there is no advantage in the rival and no benefit in the same match, because the result of the action is obviously to leave their own team with less players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match, not even because the club could not count on these players.
Of course, the benefit is that players will start the next phase of the Champions Ligue without cartons that can threaten their participation to a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be removed immediately and partly, with this action players perform a sanction match and pass into the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than the first cycle.
So, to write the scales, it is not so much that it is a benefit.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sports mind, which makes even part of the making of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (that would actually be a case of fraud of the law), or they chose instead the time they were subject to it.
They took a strategic decision without delaying the penalty or fleeing.
Although the frontier between the gene and the fraction of the law is spread, in this case I think we have had a genius case.
It appears to me because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and the way to send the guide to provoke them.
The evil caused by the sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as ethical.
Offensive offers to catch Christmas dinner for groups in NCB
The dictature of the calendary is this year a booking rate for the days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed collections by employees who want to cost between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tour and the lottery, when December comes, they also come back to the dinner of groups before Christmas who continue to be the oxygen ballon for restaurants and divertising of Barcelona, but who, due to the crisis, have put into an offensive price adjusted to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to expend between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or feed, the business men and the interviewed sector.
In order to complete the accountability, the calendar of this year (as the night of the Saint Sylvestre falls on Friday) has made the requests in the week of 13 December, with a result of evening reservations for small days (17 and 17) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies who have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the conjouture is, they ask for all battle prices, confirm the President of Gremi de Restoration of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the patronal now does not intend to predict how the festivals will be this month.
"The people think much before they book."
"They want to go out but pay much attention to prices," he mentioned.
The case will be well "for those who give quality to good price and with good service", he reminds, and recalls that the customers have the trend to decline with the crisis, so the tranche of about 25 euros has become major in the request.
In a survey in various centre institutions, the applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group points out that there is an authentic boom of applications for that Friday, with the pretention of expenditure less than 30 euros, which they have answered by adapting their menus to the conjournation, with full forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 institutions in the town (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and other), the personality of the calendar provided more preliminary reservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We did it impossible to maintain the same prices of the past year, with menus for all gos from 19,95 to 30 euros," they detailed.
ANS Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Quu and a total of 23 locals, remain optimistic after detecting an exposure of the facturation from the second seed and good, although well-handed, business perspectives for Christmas.
The sources of the group mention that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of friends who celebrate the festivals.
In their six group menus, they have held one for the birth, with 30 euros or more as a glorious budget, and the perceiving that there is a predict to expenditure for 10% more than the past year instead of requesting more details, such as the catalan manufactured wine; the champenois method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in certain companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
From the Patronat Fecasarm (including entities such as the Bars, Restorants and Divertising of Barcelona), his President, En Goma, trusts the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and supports globally the bookings are "animated", even if the customers "make business".
This is true, the hope of festivals has not been deteriorated, unless it pays, indicates it.
The Pakistanian nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons with "a faster rythme than any other countries".
Wikileaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the Pakistan American Ambassador and the United States Department filtered by Wikileaks portal confirms the great concerns that cause Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
Furthermore, the clear and sad details of the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives believed in Islamabad show that the cooperation between both countries in the field of atomic security, rather than "decrease" and that the instable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "in a faster rythme than any other country of the world".
The particularity of the Pakistanian nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
So the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, records in a report before visiting the former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The closeness of certain nuclear installations from the Territory under the Taliban attack, the spread of nuclear materials with a short voice and the vulnerability of transport of atomic materials."
The number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and miscellaneous programmes is considered, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as proliferant and a reason to maintain watch.
"Pakistan has the staff with strict religious religions to protect nuclear installations; given the decrease of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian External Ministry during a meeting with its American approvals.
The new documentation filtered by the Portal of Julian Assange is the more decreased cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high Pacific level of nuclear weapons production.
A decline from Abassade in May, which qualifys as "free" communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "The transparency is often unexistent; the aid offers remain without answer or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, states that "although the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a faster rythme than any other country in the world".
Ambassadrice Patterson also requests Washington during a visit of the Army Chairman, General Ashfaq Kayani, that he understands "treatly" to the responsibility that "Pakistan Army must end with the taste support for terrorist groups".
At the chain of the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will number a higher responsible for the anti-terrory fight to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol sends a red warning to follow moves and locates in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinthe where it is difficult to have a certainty of facts.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "localize and follow the moves" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
Moreover, this is not a new one, else he dated from 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtering of more than four million diplomatic documents in the United States, but with sexual abuses than the Australian in Sweden.
Moreover, the Wikileaks Creator advocate, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
The 20th international police body in Lyon (France) said the order on request from Sweden, but he did not publish it until yesterday after receiving the employment of the authorities of this country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the ability to identify or locate Assange "for its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although the Interpol cannot give the order of arresting a person affected by a red warning, many of the Member States, the explanations of the organization, consider the network call notes a free way for arrest -- that the national body of the police must accomplish - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and the literature, where they think that Assange is located.
The movement was indignant to the Advocates of Assange, who last night had a letter to say that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, had been disposed to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video-conference.
They also recall that Assange requested and received the authorisation to get out of Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, that it was compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin Security.
"This is a chass, not a perseverance," says the missionary.
Pense that the world looks for him - and his mother defends the innocentness of his son -- Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he doesn't touch.
On Monday, he granted an undetermined interview to the Director of the Time Review through Skype, a conversation in which he asked the Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it could be shown that it was responsible for giving orders to the United States diplomatics to violate the international treaties signed by the United States, it should leave," he said.
Her opinion was insulted by the press secretary of the Maison-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "ridicule and absurd" the request for demission.
"I'm not sure why a man's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself was charged by a high responsibility for the anti-Terrorist fight, Russell Travers, to prevent new reliefs of documents.
The pressure of President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrast with the opinions that the political and conservators declare these days.
Peter King, the Congressist who from January will preside the National Security Committee in the Base Chamber, asked the State Department to study the possibility of holding Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to construct its funds and to continue with any person who provides contributions or assistance".
More far away, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has returned to his statements after he said that Assange should be "be able to be".
"Obama should transform it into goal and use an air without equipment or something similar."
A person who did not ask for excuses was Mike Huckabee, baptism minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate to the president.
"Whoever is in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of trahison, and whatever is not a execution would be too famous punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercos seeks peace in ERC with eye climbs to Carod's adepts
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more flexible exemption and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercos 日 has found the receipt to solve the first internal revolt within the ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware of the fact that his dismission threat is not sufficient for the adcepts of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar, and that it can't absolutely give him the headwills that he had with other extent coverants.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with eyes-clicks that allow him to blind up to municipal elections.
In the beginning, Puigcercos announced that more than 200 national ERC advisers would be able to speak about its continuity in secret.
By voting bulletins, not by upright hands.
If the carodists want to carry a certain penalty vote to the President, they will be able to do it without any fear of the repairs.
In fact, the head of rangs wants to avoid the division image and the submission to his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not be considered more than one of the votes, but he had, without mentioning the percentages, a result of "Bulgaria" would not be good anymore.
Nearby persons in Carod require the President a little more than to put its position on military, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercos controls the maximum body between the congresss.
But because they do not have sufficient majority to force demissions, they will try to accept with the exhaustive a road religion until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the strategy reorientation document that the direction will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
It is intended to support Puigcercos in exchange of the promise of programming the congress for the 2011 autumn, which leaders consider as a safe fact.
The ERC leader admitted that the "polyphonia" affects stability and that its goal is to make that one time for all the organization is able to lay its lingle room in the family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
As regards the Ideologist of Puigcercos, the holder of Innovation thought that the leader would be "in exchange of various goals" is as if it had been done.
And he numbered it five, and he highlighted two.
The first, "recomposing" the exemption to represent at least 90% of the military, namely, include new figures from Carod's added sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC is liquid once for all the assembly as functioning mechanism.
It therefore defends a reform of the statutes that allows the implementation of the congresss through delegates chosen by suffrage.
Finishing with the assembly model, a exception in the Spanish party system, was an exhibition of the Puigcercos team, which has already been fighting in this sense in the last two congresss.
In fact, the conclave convulse of 2008 was charged by the direction of revising the assembly model in a specific Congress for the Reform of the Statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished because the internal marine of the last years was not recommended to address this subject.
Now, without critical sectors in the affa, the time could be good to recover it and close it forever.

China maintains the objectives of reducing rail gas effects
The representative of this country in the COP16 assured that its country has made great efforts to reduce the carbo trace and has detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce its emissions of coal gas until 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent.
China maintains its offer of reduction between 40 and 45 per cent of its emissions of gases of gas before 2020, assured Su Wei, representative of this country to the COP16.
In its first appearance in the 16th Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made great efforts to reduce the carbo trace and to restore its industry.
In fact, he exposed, in the last four years his country invested 245 million dollars in the efforts to reduce the emission of gases in the light.
However, he mentioned that China would not have its objectives, but she would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institutions and pilot programmes.
In all of these areas, the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which recognises the objectives in respect of reducing gases in the effect, explained.
On the other hand, he highlighted that in China, the Federal authorities worked in a way coordinated with the governments and locals to achieve energy sphere objectives, energy use and emission reduction.
Furthermore, it stated that there are various multiannual plans on the current or completed, both financed by the Chinese government and by the Governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned that the Energy Effective Utilization Programme, which was involved in the last five years and who received investments from the United Nations, the Government and the Private Initiative.
There is also a provincy project of climate change, another for the change of lamps to incandescence by economic lamps and another attainment and adaptation, it detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser of the Government of this country on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than what we think.
For example, he exposed that the emission per capita of gas in China is of three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made an effort without energy use, how to increase 20% energy ≥ 20% in the past five years, and intends to make it another similar to 2020.
Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former panist leader has the right to address the Commission of Order National to claim what rights is.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' exposure was adequate and that the elderly panist manager has the right to address the Commission of Ordre National to declare what rights.
In the previous interview of the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as a Governor of the State, he said, in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of Order de Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address the Commission of the Order of the National Council, where appropriate, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not the time to think in 2012 and that there has never been a covenant on the negotiation table for the presidential candidate.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December, where a follower should be chosen.
"This (a covenant in 2012) is a aspect that has never been on the negotiation table, at least for the moment, has been a approach to local elections that have succeeded and reached its goal," he mentioned.
The Panist leader mentioned that the PAN is supported for 71 years of dialogue, because "the internal competition does not make us afraid; in contrast, "we'll wear it and make it stronger," he said.
He said that the Council would certainly be able to delegate the best leader/and national action for the following three years, so he would give the reference "to the person determined by the Council".
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be sure to leave the Chairman of the Party to any of the five."
He proposed that the party's repair to the elections of 4 July will be considered to the next discussion, even if "is not the time to think in 2012."
"For the time, it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he highlighted that the three governments who have committed agreements in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so they were made "a lot of hopes about them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of the expectations".
When the Price Criticals were asked against President Felipe Calderón because of its talk during its four years of government, Caesar Nava asked the prisoners to consider the six years of the former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; that they begin to defend them; that they are out of army," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Exekutive could make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no baillon in the country, and less than censure.
Obama promotes the law in Twitter for students without paper
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your Senators and ask them to approve this law," Tvitte, the American President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama has meet today to the national mobilization to support the Lei Dream Act, to allocate students without paper, with a message in its personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your Senators and ask them to approve this law," Tvitte Obama said.
His short message remains open to a cybernetical link with an extensive document that requests the public to contact Senators immediately, because the vote to the legislation is imminent.
"In a vote we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was published after the 42 Republican Senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the reductions of the taxes in Bush's day and the financing of the Government was extended.
A such blocking, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
On the republic blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that it is confident that when the fiscal problem is resolved, a agenda for the rest of the projects can be set.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we must resolve this fiscal problem before the end of the year..."
"I think we can have an agreement at a time given in this sense and then we can plan the rest's sequence," he said.
The leader of the majority of the Democratic Senat, Harry Reid, announced on Monday that he would ask for a "vote of debating" for the Dream Act, why the initiative to enable students without paper could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senat, even if the most strict was the next week.
The Senatorial Version of the Dream Act or the American Reign Act would identify 800 thousand young people who arrived to the United States before the age of 16, remained in this country in the last five years and were accepted by a higher educational institution or the Army.
But the parties need 60 votes to approve the initiative, because they need the concurrence of a large number of republicians, in the moments where the Partisan organizations of the Protagonist project are a intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Law.
Democrats, most of which the Dream Act supports, have 58 places.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against and only a republician expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the Parties of the Dream Act need the vote of several republicians if other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most cursed republicians there are Senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the Senator George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed his mandate Senator Mel Martínez.
Other republicians who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Ha日, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hu habeninson, Texas, but they said that they would not support it in another occasion.
Another republician who supported her, John McCain, has not defined its position until now.
Although the Representative Room has a different version, the analysts agree with the fact that the largest obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
Take the literature to put the finger on the table
The second stage of the Plaisirs of the language was a promenade in which the participants made the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the plague? What hopes you from me?" asked Luisa Valenzuela who invited to open the second stage of the Plaisirs of the language, a cycle who celebrates the literature in Spanish and used this time the subtitle of his question (which is another furnished the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, explained it).
The finger on the plague "...we put in the embarras", launched doëbly the argentinian in the public, most of the young people who were gathered to the International Four of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and to which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "play" is, she goes from a doctor to another, without a response, only tracks in the same narrative file.
From the infectionologist she is convinced: "Patience is not my power, maybe it's my plague."
Finally, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his snow in the middle of the cow, but who explains that plague is not a scientific term; it is the psychanalist that shows mystery: "The plague is what is open in reality, the symbol is the cicatrice".
The protagonist suspected and concluded, "I could only know that it is open in reality and that it doesn't exist," but convinced that the pleasure and the tongue pigs must be very connected among them.
Valenzuela, the Family, played with both.
The Nicaraguayen Sergio Ramírez also exposed a ravissing narration that he entitled Eloge to the invention, where the finger on the plague is not named but at a given time is covered.
With the keys of magic realism, he speaks of an ensorcency that touched the clouds, made people who had gone far or prepared from the vertus that a lady had lost, a narration that came to speak then in America, the great news that had since the beginning of his own chronics and quoted to Bernal Díaz del Castillo that criticizes the excess of the narrations of the conquering captains.
"The slaves who invented us all (the writers) were moving from false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a harmful way we would never have counted the story of America with an imagination that even missed the potter."
However, he highlighted, "the fools and the men have the best imagination" and here the reality converge with the lie, we do not know any part of the narration belongs to a band or another, where the figure literature reaches its appetite.
This is actually called the "tradition of Cervantes".
"It's grateful for his inheritance that we are what we tell."
In turn, Mayra Montyero announced and approved the variety of interpretations caused by the FIL invitation with its round table.
The Cubaine-Portuguese has put its on the great plague of social violence that its country crossed - and Latin America divided - produces disputes of trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, the good poesy of good songs refers to a tacity commitment which is not sure pre-degree," she said, after noting that the reality of literature is the communication and size of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemic reaction" of this last.
The evening ends with the intervention of the Spanish Poet Luis García Montero, which also highlighted "this must be on the plague of the engaged plague".
He considered that in a world who lives in great speed also regarding intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the benefit of dogmatisms, "after every statement there is a small no, and behind each negative, there is a small yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of the reality, we need to weep: and nunce means many times putting the finger on the plague and deteriorating people who feel very comfortable in thinking in carcature, in white and black, in ideas established and without nutrition, and to deal with the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he invited them to recover the sense of writing.
Romanian at his first title
Ruben Omar Romano had three deficiencies in the finals he had high and lower in his career, but he knew to reach the decided series three times.
With the dual of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are also two different characteristics that are confronted by their technicians, which are among them a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano had three disasters in the end, he had high and lower in his career, but he knew to reach the decided series three times, even though he did not set up in the thousands until now, and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentin ended with comfort with the subchamp medal, he remained a step behind the winners and carefully with the same team he played conseftive finals.
The expert strategy came to its first end as an entryman in the Overnoi Tournoi 2002, when he held the dreams of Morelia with which he lost with a global result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in Clototure 2003 he also reached a decisive dual and lost again with the global result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
Avec Santos Laguna already, in the Bicentenary Tournoi 2010, again against the Diablos, Ruben suffered a reverse, because his team made a match of 2-2 against the Chopéeros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he received a benefit for 3-1 with two opportunities for the title and finally three of his players spent 11 meters and suffered the suit to the result of 4-3.
Ruben lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournoi, so he does not want to have the same outcome, he tries to get out of the wrong to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have, and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the Timoner when it was asked for him what would be his weak points in the finals.
He remembers many of the last end, which he assured that he has learned much, "the only lesson we can keep is that until the arbitr is the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, also players, because the last time, with two penalties to treat, we were already ready to cover and I think that it is a lesson, before the end of the match we can't celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which is not concerned, because he trusts his players: "We are never trying to reach the series of penalties, we are trying to end in the regular time, but sometimes it remains only to prepare us, the previous tour we were prepared, desirablely the destination has made us a bad tour, sometimes emotions or anxiety to keep the title between our hands, he escape us, it has served us as a lesson for this end, and we hope that we do not come in that situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a subchampion technician and to go for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for the receipt of visa
People need to go to the Service Centres for Visa Demanders before their interview in the Consular Section; waiting time will be reduced.
Since 10 January 2011, the procedure for the treatment of visa in the Ambassade and the United States consulars will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of the applicants must be presented to the Visa Demanding Centres (ASC, its signs in API) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the biometrical information of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before interview.
The new procedure will provide certain benefits for aspirants, among which the following are mentioned:
The total cost to treat the visa will be lower, it will not be necessary to pay a payment for a meeting anymore, another payment for the treatment of the visa and another to allow the cour service to provide the document.
The aspirant will carry out a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars in the case of visors with request (i.e. the visibility for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for trade and investor visa.
People who want to renew their vision will not have to be interviewed with the Consular Representative, they will only be presented to the ACC closer where they will present the documents and their prints will be taken.
Because the biometrical information will be taken in the ASC, the applicants who want a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain less than before.
Similarly, the Visitors in the Consulats of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo have no longer paid the additional service tariff of 26 dollars.
For further information on the new procedure to request the visa, please visit the following page http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the extraterrestrial life cover
The United States Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will affect the research of living in the space.
The National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will be tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 at the NASA seat in Washington for astrobiological experts, the science studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future life in the universe.
When she quoted the press, the NASA assured that it would have the impact on the search of alien life," which has resulted in speculations from experts in other countries.
The decover could show the theory that there are similar creatures to us and in enemy environments that we thought and put on the table the possibility of become intelligents like humans if his life conditions are improved.
It is that we are talking about a microbe covered by Mono Lake in the National Yosemit Park, California, which lives in a environment that we were thinking too friendly for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any way, the creation uses arsenic as a way of living, and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our well-being atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will take the real port of the discoveries in the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
At the conference, Pamela Conrad, who studys the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite of Saturne), will participate under the perspective that its chemical is similar to the earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and 'block' pattern opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congrès, the "bipartism" array is possible.
The 60th was installed when in the Congrès there appeared an opposite block of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, which said independently and the four questions were: the array of the "bipartism" in the Rooms.
Before starting the 60th Legislature session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, were "tone" against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they repeatedly initiated the "bipartism" because there are now two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congrès.
These four members, at the hand of Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the Coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the presidential Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI for the scheme by having a political will and if they do not have it, they will be reserved by the two parties and thus the opposite coalition will be completed.
"When it has happened (the opposite coalition), it is what I consider, because we are excluded from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences, and that is why they form a multilateral group.
We can't allow, he continued that the Congrès, after being monopolistic, or "duopolistic".
"This is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an everlasting bipartism in the Congress."
In the beginning, this group starts with 5 issuers and they now speak to others so that they are more, the Convergence has increased.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congrès has now been transformed into a "butin" between two, by allocating PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one place, now they divide it between two."
Patron Montalvo requested to respect the personality of the lawyer, to give him his place to the negotiations tables.
"When they are not allowed by cupular agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now at the five of us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to join us to seek a place in the negotiation table, it is the problem that in the reform they have made, which they have decided, we are outside and we are not agreed with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another cheque to the owner of the electrical material company.
Another cheque of approximately 200 miles of weight benefited from Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by Marie.
In this case, the amount payable to the owner of the electrical material company was 1 million 200 miles weight.
According to the Communication Transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last 16 November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 weights, as a concept of "subsidy accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Supreme Auditor to sell at a higher price.
What we haven't reported is the total debt, and therefore, how many cheques will be issued for Camacho Palazuelos.
"We have nothing buyed, we just pay him what we need to do to him, as the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The latest cheques "represented" the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been held in the Official Journal of the State, the provisions of the Law when a company is asked by the ASE, to avoid other governments using its services, the Reserveer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after the 25th July of Northwest, had made a review of the cheets that Marie issued to its suppliers, showing that in March 2008 - July 2010, in the Trinity of the Maire Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Camacho Palazuelos Municipe paying more than 10 million weights, through 42 cheques.
He also performed transactions with Jumapam, covering cheets of more than 3 million weight.
Tourist sites must be treated
Tourist undertakers regret the age of the foreign tourist due to the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada round in Mazatlán.
After the grave of a foreign tourist in a crowd of the Sánchez Taboada Round, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to take attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and to design a bad picture of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, reminded that they have asked several times that the image of the destination should be treated and that new activities should replace other than the tourists.
He said that the bad state of streets and roads has been affected because tourists are coming and see the disaster and avoid close trades.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day, and they don't know the strength we lose, otherwise they did not work for so long and without a suitable planning."
Hoteller José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the caught of the tourist was exposed to the lack of prevention and maintenance of Marie.
"The municipality will have to take his responsibility and avoid it again, how to do it, so it has a preventional maintenance and not just make the corrective," he said.
"We want to play a own city, because not only because it is a tourist area, but as a people who deserve a clean place to live there, and Mary must change its strategy to maintain the city."
There are other sites that are negligible and incomplete, he said, for example, Escudo and Venadito of Mazatlán.
"Auourd today, because the tourist comes, it is not only dependent on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanness in its beaches, bulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We didn't give them attention to the need and this type of facts highlights something that is meaningful for all, the maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under the Secretary of Tourist Promotion, stated that the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent because they are not used correctly and designed a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be online with the municipality and be a priority to have the city upgrade, clean, ordered and attractive because it has a tourist call.
"Happy Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered from front, cleaned and set online to make them attractive to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results in Congrès
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the Members should be the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa due to various challenges.
Mazatlán's business sector requests a worth and free work legislation between the parties and the Governing Experient, since Sinaloa is convulsed and confronted with major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th islature was installed by seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one of the PVEM, in total 40 peoples.
The list of experts that the new integrated Government Congress is a clean and committed management with the society and the various sectors needing a responsible islative work and that the same patterns of partial or parentalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the Members should be the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa due to various challenges.
"We hope the Members actually exercise their rights, free agreements between the parties, because the coutum is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they transform themselves into mask of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certifie the commitment to establish the needed points that the Governing Board makes progress.
"We will ensure that they do a dignity and particularly committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their trust vote in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 people's representatives is to push and hold forces in seeking the economic growth of the State, since the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important is that they stimulate economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and this will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourist activities, he asked the new issuers to give her the importance she had in the Governing Budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I realize that this is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget, and it is incongruent as an important economic and generating activity of devises and investments and which directly relates to agriculture."
In addition to the fact that resources should be classified to tourist detonator projects that help to provide security to the State and update the Alcool Law that the former isolations have not been able to solve.
We're looking for King Mage
Popees, cars and bicycletes, including other games, are the desire of the Coronado Valenzuela family children.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings Mages will be difficult to carry out their illusions, because their home is not more than 12 people and a hair.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the games and clothes they want.
The family lives a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live daily because their father does not have a stabil job.
"It's very hard for us, because my husband doesn't have any job, but we're selling mandarins and patates... and the afternoon I'm going out with the "plabes" to sell in the street," Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, four years old, wants a powder or a bicycle, and his sister Isabel, three years old, would like a powder Barbie.
At his turn, José Alfredo, who has been 10 years old, has been aspiring to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He said to me (Jose Alfredo), "I'd like to have this monster," but I said to him, "We'll see, my son," because he was very dear," he remembered with tristance Cayetana.
For the biggest children, who were in the oil, clothes and chaussures would be the ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, was cut down the size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, was cut down the size 10, while Miguel, age eight, washed the size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needed a couple of sports chaussures, so a couple of the size of five and a half or six would help him much.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the On Search Roi Mage campaign by giving a play or money to the Northwest receipt.
14 Summary of arrested drugs
A declaration of perquisitions has been made in Strasbourg, Thursday, in the context of the demanting of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourth persons have been arrested and will be faced with different actions.
The prosecution was deployed in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have served for drug production.
"And about 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of haschich, money and equipment that have been produced," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, portfolio of Quebec Security.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two heads of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
Persons arrested in comparison to Sherbrooke's justice palace in hours after their arrest.
They could face cannabis production areas, in order to make traffic, comploitment and service flights, including.
These prosecutions have occurred after a long haleine investigation, which has dured nearly a year.
"This is the information received from the public that allowed us to process these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers of the Regional Inquiry Module of the Security of Quebec, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memprémagog Police Region participated in this police operation.
Clandestine will continue without problems
The draft Conservative Law, which, by the Government, should resolve the problem of the battles loaded by clandestin migrants, is evidently being held while the three opposite parties have made a show that they cannot support it.
"I'm strongly supported on the Chart."
"I'm standing with a party who created the granite under your feet," said Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by members after the weekly meeting of the cacus.
Liberals claim that the draft law as proposed, which would allow all persons from a ship identified as a transporter of Clandestin immigrants to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Chef of the Quebecois Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the law project, because he takes it to the wrong goal.
"We're against and it's that all parties of opposition are against, then we'll see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism on immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms of the hand that will not be enough closed to the Clandestin immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrates agree to take measures against Clandestin passengers and that is what we do through another law project, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the draft conservator law because it takes it to the reserved and catches children for at least one year," explained Mrs. Chow.
The Ministry of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of opposition to play politics and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians say massively to the Members that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine, these `all operations that target Canada and treat the country as a paillasson'."
"They expect Canada to take closed measures," reacted Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a conviction vote on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections coming to its rejection.
However, a conserver said to the QMI Agency that the Government would ask for a vote so that each Member who would oppose himself would then be explained before his electors.
The new unit does not make a singleness
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and corruption by Jean Charest, many observers continue to ask for the establishment of a questionary committee on this subject.
The Ministry of Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea would not be given yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since January.
Metropole has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the Tuesday announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec on 29 October, this measure has never been discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
It was no longer necessary for the peculiar criticism in the field of security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement of "lapin out of a head" and "breaked solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those fearing that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, please say."
"We know that problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can be replaced by an investigation.
"More Mr. Charest does not want to create this questioning committee, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have an investigation committee is the demission of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, ethical and governing teacher at the National Administration School.
He therefore suggests that Quebec gives a special mandate to the general verifier in order to ask for corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general verifier," he claims.
He also believes that Quebec could give the verifier the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to prohibit people to witness.
The creation of a permanent school is not the only project in the charest government cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa of 日 the Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be issued by the prosecutor of the Marteau Operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not expressed in such a kind of question.
The Federal Ministry of the Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his responsibility of the Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently concerned about certain amendments related to this matter.
During the 2001 Printems Operation, who broke the motorway groups, even if the Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa then adopted the Gangsterism Law.
High supervisory rivers
Several water courses remain under high monitoring because of strong preceptions that have been struck over several regions of the province since Tuesday.

From 20 to 40 millimeters of additional rain were expected on Thursday night, regions.
The sectors north of the river and in the Valley of Outauais were the most touched.
They could receive up to 100 miles of rain in total.
As these precipients must be added to the source of snow already accompanyed in certain sectors, we are afraid of the crossing of several water courses.
Wednesday warnings were issued by the Civil Security of Quebec for Ureau and Achigan, Lanaudière.
North, Saint Jerome, Laurentides, and Cheni, in Lotbinière, were subject to the guards of indentation and remained under supervision.
In the Lanaudière region, the strong precipients led to the debordement of certain lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary pond was carried out because of strong rain.
Ten residents had to be evacuated in prevention.
In Outaouais, the debordement of certain lakes led to closing several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security remains on a warning feet and monitors the situation nearby, indicated Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Cross Prevision Centre has for its part Wednesday advertising of strongly cruel for several hardware, including Maskinongé, The Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partly blamed dupont
The radio animator of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has made a partial turn before the Canadian Council of the radio television standards (CCNR) for the issues of social assistance and the Haitians as well as on its large language in woven.
The CCNR believes that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI team 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some proposals contained "inexactive information on social assistance, induely negative representations of Haitians and great languages which were not covered with the exposed emissions during the day".
The Council also concluded that a debate on suicide, including the diffusion of the name of two people who were self-suicided, did not violate the radiodiffusion codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints on comments made during emissions issued between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint from the Common Front for Social Assistents in Quebec.
The group claimed that the amounts in the emission were inaccurate.
Animators must provide solid information instead of foolish.
With regard to suicide, Stéphane Dupont's animator thought that suicide was a lach gesture.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the vehicle message was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes related to "Dupont the Middle" have discussed a delicate and appropriate subject."
It was therefore not held at its place.
The last letter was on statements that followed the land tremblement in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a median face that had experienced many reactions.
The CHOI animator said that he had done no gift to help the Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the needed people would really receive money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unnecessary negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already cleaned my suspension for three days there above."
"My dossier is virgin for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee refers to the broad language diffusion.
In each case, the CHOI-FM radio difuser "except his obligation".
The consequences are minimised for the station which, inter alia, should announce these decisions once during the hours of great hearing within a period of three days.
A King of Kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian Montreal Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special park.
The excellent athlete in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxes are on the tatamics and the world's rings looking for new challenges.
"I began to practice martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to develop with professionals."
"In my case, I seek battles somewhere, because for those who do not love the current game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security agent and as a worker for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to its chairs, with two gold medals in the Championnat of the World Karate and Kickboxing world (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimbourg, in Ecosse.
"I got the category of kickboxing full contact and Thai box, he explained."
"Instead, I'm ready to go to China for the Shoo-Shoo World Coup."
"The fighters who ended among the first four during the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I took the bronze in 2009 to Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I concluded the tournoi at the fifth range, while I arrived the third to Toronto in 2009."
"What's interesting is that I've progressed in every competition."
"In this rythme, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where poing and foot-cooks are authorised, as well as the designs on the ground.
Dusts are originally rolled on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most renamed pugilist of this form of fight is the Vietnamese American origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence to the super tournoi "King of Sanda", the Super Bo of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the most highest and most prestigious in China, explained the gellard sympathic."
"This is a little the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stade (the largest stage in Thailand)."
"This was a great experience."
Zemmal took his first fight, in half-final of its category (80 kg), before he lost the end.
"The one who won me was a real pro," he analyzed.
"The four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)"
"The semi-final winners are at the end of their category."
"The winners of each category are faced to coron one champion, the King of Kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without offers
Hydro-Quebec granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this balance of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor firms that have received the most important, the project management, for a sum of $295 million without offers.
This consortium called Energy Gerance was established in 2004 in concomitant manner with the choice of Hydro-Quebec to grant the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Consortium Energy Gerance distorted the profitable contract without calling for public offers.
For the Quebeco Partie, the recovery to business consortiums has a serious ethical problem that can eliminate competition and cause price increase.
"This is the new way to make the concurrence and break the competition."
"It means that people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly," said the Pequist Sylvain Simard in press conference yesterday.
Morning, Mr Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said hard to see how the interest of the public can be used in this way.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied on the afternoon, and not strictly that it had been for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my journey," she picked up, supporting that the PQ had been "malone" and "manked a ridicule".
She said that it would be the least of the things that the PQ is apologizing.
The formula of consortiums is a coherent practice in the world.
It is usually a limited covenant at the time that allows two or several companies to re-group their respective expertise to respond to a call for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity with the width of travels.
The song is running and must escape until 2012.
However, the contract was assigned without the competition game; there was negotiation.
Therefore, the formula of consortiums is no longer a exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As shown in the last week The Device, the formula of consortiums in the gene-consult sector is subject to an investigation to the Government.
A quick survole of Quebec's business registry allows more than 200 consortiums, including some permanent.
So the company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens, leading to one and even a moral person, or Dessau.
For the consortium Energy Gerance, Minister Normandeau highlighted that "the Territory of Baie James is responsible for special work dynamics and that Hydro-Quebec is particularly responsible for it since the 70s".
The large patron of the Eastman project, Real Laporte, the Energy Society of Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that stressed the fact that the management contract had been granted in a pleasure.
"If you're calling for offers and there's no suppliers, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take those who are in this market and say, we will negotiate a satisfying understanding and a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, it is the competence of people," Mr Laporte said.
This contract granted to the Consortium Energy Gerance is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After checking, the Devoir complied with 109 gene-consequently contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their branches, including solar workers.
SNC-Lavalin discussed 22 contracts, Genivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without compliance with its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the Energy Energy contract of $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard has heard that the four firms composing the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "good known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
The Ministry of Normandeau has allowed the PQ to be also linked to those firms who "financing" before determining that it was in place of its leaders.
Barometer of the responsible consumption - The "verte" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but honestly skeptic.
The chebecois consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development operators, but also on equitable marks and certification to guide its choices.
Pis, even if he goes into a median universe where messages for a more responsible consumption are broken, it deplores a lack of creditable information, since he even qualifys of frein to his commitment, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first reading has been delivered yesterday.
Although they have increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecois grant very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as the green publicity of companies, shows the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of the Consumer of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other evidence: The half of consumers doubts the reliability of the official certification based on equitable products, but also the credibility of the products and marks that are coherent, indicates the Barometer.
In the same vineyard, only 14,6% of the Quebecoes are seriously talking about this subject.
However, the information on the responsible consumption is primary to stimulate this consumption bread currently animated by near the third of the Quebeco consumers.
In fact, the empty and doubtful character of the information would calm 46% of consumers.
This is the second brain identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Moreover, one third of the Quebecois is also increasingly disapprovaled to the allocated performances of the green products or services that are seeking to put them into their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and, in particular, changed the mark of one or more products to respond to their conviction.
At 61 per cent, they also favoured purchases to trademarks in their quarter and privileged purchasing foods cultivated in their region, indicates the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption has reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Quebec consumer Homo loves to present himself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental printing by concerning the protection of animals.
But his social and ological consciousness, however, remaining outside the car, indicates the Barometer: in 2010, at least 28% of Quebecois have indicated that they have used common transport or have preconceived covoiture to defend their green interests.
The walk and the car also were supported by 39.1% of the participants in this large behavior investigation, which just took its first clique.
A loan from the State for the eXcentris recovery
The Government of Quebec, who was asked to engage financially in the eXcentris film complex by the Society and the Parallelle, accepts to be acquired, but only in concurrence with a loan.
The Development Society and the Parallelle, who hoped a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurent Building by recompensing her full cinema vocation, do not get what they claimed.
The Government accepts to be involved in the case, but in its own conditions.
In addition to the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would be lower than the initial expectations, which could constitute a sustainable solution to advantaged conditions, at least the opinion of the sources issued by the State officials.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec in the last year, but the requests have been revised at the latest.
A proposal and a action plan were sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Cultural Development Society (SODEC), François Macerola, which pilots the eXcentris dossier.
He made him a last report a few days ago.
But the opposite of the cabinet reached the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and ́us have to answer it until 31 December.
However, the hypothesis of the State's donation must be truly separated.
Let us note that the Association of Caremas and Cineparks of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support the eXcentris rabat, which suggests that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance immobiliar projects, which he did not for other cinema rooms.
In contrast, many environmental intervenants claimed a sustainable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the chief of censes, took the author cinema in its locals of the complex after financing himself his construction, which could justifie a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is crying to Montreal, and eXcentris was able to trust his client.
The Society and the Parallelle, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilot, on their side, a private funding campaign, expecting to collect $700,000 to move to the purchasing road.
Since 2009, one of the three screens, The Parallele, continues to distribute eXcentris movies.
The purpose of future purchasers is to open the three rooms on the next 27th February by designing the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember the Deviation and we ignore what he and his group think of proposals to be made to them.
The wheel raised on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables divulged by WikiLeaks raise the wall on what the United States view as the inflammation complex of Canadians to the Americans, but at the same time they make the feeling of the supremeness towards Canada.
The American diplomates thus surprise that every Canadian elector had not the Canadian-American relationships by voting and believe that the visit of President Obama helped the Conservative Government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American ambassador in Ottawa and Washington on the yesterday place offer more cross-style details than the substantial content to be placed under the teeth.
A cat of 22 September 2008, whether in the full federal election campaign, relates to how the United States are not part of the consequences discussed by the political leaders.
At the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations to this situation.
"A complex of Canadian inflation may be a condition of Canadian political leaders to talk about the internal enjoyes of the day instead of bringing this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he wrote.
The United States, therefore, are "the elephant proverb of this election: all present, but possibly too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands at least that "assuring silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Does he, logically, consider the ability of a candidate, a party and more than a leader of the party to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that the electors have in mind by going to vote."
The other expression of this importance is read in the cab sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, charged for business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for its first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the survival of the Government during the start-up vote on the Federal Budget, which will show Canada its first deficit over a decade due to a 30-40 billion dollar renewal plan," wrote Mr. Breese.
No part mentioned that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being reversed by the coalition and that the opposite parties would have made its conditional survival to the quality of the proposed repair plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington from the more negative image than the dramatic series distributed to the CBC from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which we observe little subtil references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or even to the removements for muscle questions from the Â.
Another cab reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French author Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take some prisoners in Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the " case per case".
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "He sent a paper to the State secretary about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary accepted revision of the dossier."
Let us finally note that the spirits go out about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a very close adviser of Stephen Harper, stated on CBC's walls that the responsible for this massive flight should be "emed".
Mike Huckabee's echo in the United States.
A World Plan to Renew lighting
The United Nations offered a renewal plan in Cancún in 100 countries in order to reduce the gas effects (GES) which corresponds to nearly thirds of the additional reduction to the planetic climate of 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the broadcast of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún in order to acquire the absence of commitments to reduction by industrialized countries.
According to the yesterday schedule, if the incandescent ampoules that are still monopolising from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampoules or, better, by electrolunic diodes ampoules (DEL or "LED" in →a), the essential of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES issued on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen, last year, the large issuer countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have been involved in voluntary reduction plans that should lead to the global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to submit this balance to 5 Gt to stabilize the increase of climate from 2020 to 2 degrees to avoid being out of control.
In the incandescent ampoules, 95% of energy is disordered in the form of warmness and the rest, or 5%, produced from light.
With fluocompact ampoules, the energy cost is reduced by 75% and with the new Del ampoules, this energy need is decreased by twice.
Fluocompact ampoules are at the middle of 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new ampoules in Del, as those who launched the manufacture Philips this week - this company also participated in the United Nations study - have a life hope of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandessing ampoule, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with reostates in addition to exhibit very little warmness.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Many specialists have shown reservations in the place of fluocompact ampoules because they contain the mercury and that it is necessary to eliminate them as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except if the manufacturers place consigns.
However, the report indicates that the main source of emission of mercury on the planet is not the fluocompact ampoule, but the thermical centres of carbon, which emit a lot of mercury to produce election in incandescent ampoules.
Only in the United States, these centrals issue 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits each country would be made through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would spare a billion dollars per year in election purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, or the equivalent of 3.5 thermical centres whose construction would cost 2,5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects in nervousness to announce electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, recalled the publication "without time" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiration of the fixed periods.
"The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent electoral committee to end his work and announce the provisional results without further time, stressed a portfolio of the United Nations head's password."
"He requests all Ivoirian parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and to avoid any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressures under certain foreign governments, the electoral committee has allowed the swimming date of midnight without the results, three days after Sunday review.
Nearly 40 minutes before the expiry of the time, the CEI President claimed to television that the Committee was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
The calls were multiplied Thursday in the world so that the CEI finally proclaimed the name of the winner of the second tour between Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp refers to the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulous" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Ivoirian President's campaign, claimed that the works of intimidation of electors made by the United Nations in the north of the country had dismissed the parties of the President to vote.
Any election could be canceled if the complaints presented by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional Council.
But the opposers of Gbagbo believe that the highest coast of the country is not neutral because it is guided by Paul Yao N'Dré, a nearby political covenant of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North that declines to the ex-rebells, judged "inacceptable" the rest in the announcement of results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go to return the victory.
Its aliens claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has made a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral committee to distribute the results, it would be illegal.
The second turn of the presidential, Sunday, was to co-ordinate the process of reconciliation and reconciliation of a country remained spent in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivoire political class on Thursday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first tour on 31 October with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, which received public support from the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first road).
The rate of unemployment remained stable in France at the third quarter
The rate of unemployment in France in the meaning of the International Work Office (BIT) remained stabil to 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% by counting the other sea departments) shows the corrected data of the provisional Sessional variations (CVS) on Thursday.
The number of labourers is 2.631 million in metropolis.
The second quarter data were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% with DOMs.
In a year, the rate of unemployment increases by 0.1 points.
More widely, 3.4 million people in Metropolitan France did not work at the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not available in the two weeks and that they were looking for or not a job.
The situation of young people present on the work market has still been decreased, with a new increase in unemployment rate, with 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points for three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25% including DOMs.
At the third quarter, 637 000 youth from 15 to 24 years were unemployed in the sense of the BIT.
The elders have known for their part an increase in unemployment, 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points for three months and for a year), or 482.000 people of 50 or more years, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from the stability of unemployment at the third quarter, 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 points for three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has no more monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a polemic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the Statistical Agency of the European Union, continued to do it and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini was examined and placed in prison
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, manager of waste treatment and brother of PS President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhone, has been reviewed and encouraged to the House of Luynes, nearby Aix-en-Provence in the framework of an investigation on fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guérini has been reviewed for abuses of social goods, decline of funds and public goods, reception, active corruption, influence traffic and detention of municipalities, indicates his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting and is trying to explain about all the issues that the magistrate will put to him, not fantasies."
"It's easy to follow it for a reprehensive head, it's something else to prove them," AFP said his avocate, Florence Rault, before his client's audience.
Mr. Guerini, the strong man brother of the PS in the Department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had to make a memo, through his lawyers, a court before his audience, to explain.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also made in a review on Thursday evening.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client never did anything else but to do the decharges he had to handle.
As regards the allocation of markets or the destination of funds related to their functioning, he never knew it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, the former director of the Aubagne Aglomeration Services, has been made in a quarter review for public and complicated funds, and has left free under Judic control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My customer has said to give explainments to the facts that he is pronounced."
"The instructor judge took account of him not to be free," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were reviewed and released in freedom on Thursday night, with a position under Judicial control for two of them, indicated the adjoint of the Republic of Michael Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, adjoint Director-General for the purity of Marseille Provence Mettropole (MPM), is continued to "traffic of passive influence and corruption".
Two officers of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringier are being examined for "substration and decline of public goods by a person charged by a public service mission", the other for "committed to department of public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has been reviewed for "abuses of social goods".
Among those who were confronted with Mr. Guérini figures Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets touching the Corse.
The investigators assured his companies that they used the money of the large banditism.
The request shall be carried out in the framework of several open Judicial information against X in April 2009 after anonymous courts, for frauds prejudiced in public marketing, in particular in the waste office.
From near the search source, investigations are particularly regarded by the conditions of assignment and operation of a decharge of La Ciotat, which collects the residues of Aubagne and some cities of the city of Marseille (MPM).
Affairs Clotilde Reiss: Elisée exagered the mediation of the eye
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spinage", held the opinion in haleine in France, warned diplomacy, and enhanced the detection of relations between Paris and Teheran.
All under the attention of the United States diplomates.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by the World reveal some of the following crisis.
They describe how Elisea explained his strategy to the Americans, going to give them advice to the treatment of their own "otage crises" in Iran (a small group of randonneurs).
They show how the French responsibles sought to convince Washington that the freedom of young French has not been given in contrast to the release of the freedom of Kakavand, a Iranian prisoner in France and searched by the American justice for the traffic of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put under a cruel light the way the French presidentship tried to manipulate the media to believe the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, there was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram edited on 12 to 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way to manage otage cases".
The Counsel of Elysée for Strategic Affairs, François Richer, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is involved with the American diplomatic Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise Americans to do so much for rapat— their own citizens holding force in Iran.
"Woods," they say, "martel in the media the words "human rights", "inocence", "inmediate freedom".
It is necessary to enlarge the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it as much as Iranians ask you not to do."
'Cause, after the trials of discussion through discrete channels, ' silence will rule nothing', the Iranians are 'masters in dilatory hands'.
Mr. Richier's arrest of strangers is "a Iranian tactic: the taking of ottes for political changing".
It announces that Clotilde Reiss' freedom of prison (which will intervene on 16 to, on the day it is repeated to the French ambassade) will "require the payment of a large amount of money to Iranians" (230 000 euros).
And he indicates that the Elisee anticipates other otage crises, a phenomena that "will be aggraved."
The Iranians could "in a near future stop another of about 1.800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28-2009.
Clotilde Reiss has gone out of prison for twelve days, but remains locked in Iran.
An information is distributed: the Iranian Education Kakavand, whose United States claims the extraction for an illegal electro-electrical traffic for Iran, is free to Paris, on a judge's decision.
The American ambassade, as many observers, is questioned about this cruel coincidence.
For Washington, who tracks the Iranian clandestin networks for the nuclear program, the extension of Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France accept a marketing?
The freedom of Iranian against the French?
When a new entrepreneur with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier ensures that it is not the case.
The Elysée, said, did not only "he was completely taken by a surprise by the judge's decision," but he tried to oppose it.
"There were living exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the stages" (in the meantime, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the decision," he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Kakavand remains placed under the "etroit" supervision of French information services.
Elisee's adviser consists of a phone number, raccroche, and then reports the American diplomat that Iranian is currently located in buildings in Paris by the Iranian ambassade.
• the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elisea does not affect its efforts, by means of organised and "fighted" in the media, to believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediterrane".
The Americans observe this activity not without ironicity, and see that the manipulation brings its fruits because several pressing articles reflect the French official version.
A telegraph dated from 25 to 2009 refers to the "the Media Blitz" of the French officers.
On the basis of such "gratitude" expressed to Mr Assad, the ambassade is asked in Paris.
"By their full declarations of praise, the French officers are in private that they have only a weak understanding of what the people have actually done."
The document then refers to the reasons that Elisee had been motivated to enter into this fiction.
The intense efforts to communicate "see to validate Sarkozy's opening policy," he analyzes.
A policy that was held in 2008, which was "after being considered by many critical voices in France and the foreigner, as pre-mature and immortal."
By "exhibiting the Syrian role," Paris is seeking to "demonstrate the praise she can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "seat discourse grains between the Iran and the Iran".
The American ambassade knows it of good source.
On 11th a.m., François Richier confided to him: "We don't know whether the people have done anything."
"But we thanked them at all."
"This should at least seem confusion in Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elisea.
In one case, he thanks to the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and the Senegal, for their "active role in the freedom of our partner".
No online games for young Korean last midnight
The South Korean Government will adopt a "Cendrillon" law which will prohibit adolescents to play online games after midnight by blocking their access, indicated government responsibles.
A draft law will be submitted to the Parliament in December to request online games to block access to these games after midnight, younger ones less than 16 years of age, indicated representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulties to study in the oil and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said the AFP Jo Rin, ministerial responsible for the draft law.
Online games will be accessible again at 6 hours ago.
Companys will have a year to prepare for the application of the law.
The Government also intends to request companies to limit the time of access to these games for young people whose parents are looking for it has been responsible.
It will also make available to people who call free software to limit the past time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and the journals regularly report different facts related to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the incompatible campaign of world competition online games.
In November, South Korea had received four gold medals in World Cyber Games, faced with 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designs the organizational countries
In full, because of corruption suspects, the Fifa's ex-effective committee designs the World Coups countries in June 2018 and 2022, a least political choice where influence and lobbying are able to take steps on technical criteria.
One thing is sure that the edition of the Queen Competition of Fifa in 2018 will occur in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: \letter, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands).
The 2022 Cell will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoped to win new territory (Qatar,日), after a first in the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implantation in the United States or in the Extreme-East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's emmer, Zidane, Beckham, Beckyff) provides the measure of the economic and political injuries of a worldwide.
Thus, coulisse treatments are risked to take up until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the documents of the Spanish, the Portuguese (2018) and the American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be very harsh for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, from the origin of the revelations that have reached the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Themerie and Amos Adamu), could have destroyed the chances of his country, a football beach that only accepted the World only one time in 1966.
The BBC transmitted it a cow on Monday, by distributing a documentary which is three members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to do with the Fifa and put the responsibles in the embarrass, which have made it in an intense lobbying these last weeks with David Cameron in the first line.
The Government leader hopes to re-evaluate the success of his pre-decedent Tony Blair, who had received the OJ-2012 organization for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be able to rebound the blason of England to the EC?
Nothing is less sure because two Spain-Portugal does not miss atouts with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its foot culture.
However, economic and financial perspectives in both countries could be ambitional.
Possible repressions against Spain and Portugal are only due to the Russian cottage, which have become an outside of weight despite the lacunes of its document (states, hotels, transport).
But the Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine decided not to move to Zurich and expressed a "loyal competition in the preparation of the vote" in an appeal of the English pressure against the members of the EC.
"When we cover them, we're trying to compromise them," Mr. Poutine launched.
For 2022, the United States, strong experience in 1994, appear as logical favors.
First World Economic Power, seat of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country → has a progressing length on Japan and South Korea, which have made a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates appear to be pre-mature for two countries who have joined the test in 2002.
Other threats: the grant of the Mondial-2026 to China, which would be deeply desired by the Fifa, which would actually make Asian opportunities for 2022.
Avec the Qatar, who went out the great game by proposing future stages, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries have more risks than certainty.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also lead to the weakness of the TV rights purchased by the European countries, the nerf of the war for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle was really hesitated.
Mitterrand had believed he was ill.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the latest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than they.
A mandate to Elisea calls another.
So the current head of the State will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not make good business with the mystery part attached to the presidential function.
So it must be as if the doubt always exists.
In a sense like in the other.
In 2006, even without faith, Jacques Chirac's friends predicted that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "a part of the 2011 autumn".
That he refers to UMP parliamentaries, on Monday evening at Elisea, the perspective of "two mandates" has thus seed a little febrility.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
We were far away.
The President only reminded that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited the number of five years.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he refers to the President, on the tonne of the humor, at such meetings.
"The worst, or best, you still have it for seven years and half with me," he started them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the following step."
His talks on the front last night do not make it more candidate than watch; they do not make it less.
If they submit comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the course to the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But this isn't the input in Segolène Royal school that moves Nicolas Sarkozy to devote.
In contrast, it is because its candidate in 2012 is evident that many PS claims to be a war order for more than the planned.
The bad investigations, on the other hand.
For the first time, the right electors would prefer the candidate of François Fillon to the Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there are no discussions in the OMP above," he immediately and immediately reacted to the Ombudsman's surrounding.
"If he believes that it is possible, he will not be candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always believe that he can win," adjusts Alain Juppé, signed evidently.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its acquisition of State titles
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year had to be the opportunity to specify the crisis output procedures or at least announce the stop of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to end at the end of the year.
The European Debt Crisis is obliged by the Francfort Emissions Institute, of course, will not be allowed to be even incompatible with a situation more than today on the European obligatory markets.
The political cost would be so higher.
On the occasion of a press conference, the Minister for French Finances, Christine Lagarde, thus welcomed the active role played by the ECB for the resolution of the debt crisis in Europe.
She didn't want to say if she estimated that the central bank had to do more, for example, increasing its purchasing programme of sovereign obligations.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners..."
In Brussels, when it was heard by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, showed no longer aware of its intentions, satisfied to make sure that the programme of purchase of state titles on the secondary market was "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting of this July.
Only certainty: The ECB will keep its main rate of leader inchanged to 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of obligations by the ECB have doubled the last week, nearly 1,35 billion euros.
And, in fact, the indiscretion of market operators, it would have made new Irish and Portuguese purchases yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the euro have bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Marketing operators have no doubt the pre-consequences of purchases (see page 29).
Economys do not even expect a significant change of head.
If over three months loan operations have already expired from the ECB's arsenal, this last is still going to unlimited liquidity allocations of generic conditions and for periods of a week to three months.
Economys today expect that this device be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that it's importantly changing her programme."
"If this would take the risk of providing new short-term pressures," says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economy.
"A progressive outcome during the first quarter of 2011 seems more ≥", precepted by Norbert Brams, economy at Sal.
Uppenheim.
On the basis of its interventions on the debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to animate a atonic market", Âe Norbert Brums.
As regards the importance of the exposures of European banks to the overseers markets in the euro area, the Emissions Institute has no other choice to maintain its presence on the market.
"They must be replaced by any price by the lack of investors on the market and act so to prevent the packaging of the loans paid by the most fragile States," a major mandatory manager yesterday.
Because if the interest rates are involving, the States will be so much more genetic to reduce their endlessly, other than to stabilize it.
The euro's safeguard is at this price.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi is running
At the beginning of a week concerned about Italy, the situation was a little deteriorated, yesterday, with the reflux of the obligation rates at 10 years.
Return to the pre-called calm.
On a meeting with the Ministry of Economics, the presidents of the region said that Giulio Tremonti had heard qualifying the situation of "innumerable" and waiting for a week-end "forward", which the interested one then denied.
Thursday, the German long rate rubber had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of failure (CDS) was involving 263 points, which caused a certain deal in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the German rate-rate-art was greater than 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said "fortunately concerned" by "marketing turbulences" and by a possible counterpart from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economicist in Hudson Institute.
In its problem, it is the absorption of growth and atony of tax income, which is going with the State, making the risk of not yet covering its needs of funding.
The last previsions in Brussels have been a cold dust for the Government.
The Italian growth is now expected to 1,1% in 2011 and to 1,4% in 2012... while the current budget is based on 1,3% and 2%.
In these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will represent 4.3% of the BDP in the next year (contrast 3.9% of the Government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Where the sound of a new budgetary collection that could be placed after the feasts, for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new outermost measures must be taken," he considers the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, O日 Rehn.
For the time, Italy receives support for international institutions.
"The economy's accounts are in order and its accounts are good, we have repeated it for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund for Italy in the FMI.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long-term, because, despite its important debt (119.2% of the PIB in 2011, NDLR), the efforts requested for stabilising in Italy are less than those requested to other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Economy.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censuring motion to the House of Members, following which previous elections could be organized by the end of March.
It would then be opened a little profitable period for decision-making in case of serious crisis.
Europeans consider the strengthening of anticrisis devices
Christine Lagarde still marted it last night in a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have still shown it on Sunday and night, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defend their currency and their monetary area."
Despite any related, the registered detention on the rate of European State obligations brought water to the governments and the ECB's molecule.
But we can't talk about a start of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation agency announced that it could decrease the note of Portugal's debt, the most specified target today by speculation.
"Like in May, there is a real lack of clearness and political visibility, which is particularly on the systems of employment," states Exane BNP Paris economys.
More than "the political time is much slower than the market time".
Conscients of this heat and the dangers he reveals, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen existing anticrisis devices.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned Ministers of Finance and, more widely, with their partners of G20 are going to be a good train.
And this is also regarding European Group and Ecofin meetings from the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the menu, the outcome of non-conventional measures for support to the countries of the euro area in the marketimator (see above).
As regards the European Financial Stability Fund (FESF), its ex-Ray Director, Klaus Regling, started on Thursday in Singapore a Asia tour to inform extreme-east investors of the crisis development in Europe.
If the goal of these visits is not to raise funds, it will certainly prepare the area.
The first emissions of the FESF shall be provided in the next month.
Yesterday, a American official representative confided to the Re-Agency that the United States would support an eventual increase in funds mobilised by an additional direct commitment to the FMI.
The countries in the first line, Portugal and Spain, with regard to them, are able to adopt reforms, in particular in the organization of the work market.
Reforms relating to higher efficiency measures.
Lisboa and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
The one and the other are able to avoid seeking international assistance before establishing their own budgetary corrections and decisioning necessary reforms in order to restore strong confidence.
The other European funds are finally involved in the options available to accelerate the standardization process of the higher obligations.
From pass to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advanced idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not be able to return the hand to the portfolio.
The economys of Barclays Capital, an actor of any first plan of the European debt market, believe that an average of approximately 100 billion euros would provide "preference" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: this is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which is 60 billion euros today.
A Council that has all opportunities to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions would be imprisoned.
Snow and glass: 24 departments in orange monitoring
Negative episodes still generate difficulties of employment, especially on the secondary network in Bretagne, and risk some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in oral monitoring due to the risk of snow and snow.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Two Serves and the Vienna have been acquired of 20 departments already in an oral supervisory, 18 from Thursday after Thursday and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to France, supported snow abbreviations affect the north of the Girond and the Charentes and lowly snow on the Ice-de-France.
Snow boxes from 2 to 5 cm, pointly from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are the departments of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandia, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Negative episodes are sufficiently significant to generate difficulties of employment and to disturb certain economic activities, predicts Meteo France.
In the Cotes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited to weight weights of more than 7,5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brie-Loudeac.
The secondary networking in Bretagne is very difficult for the gendarms who recommend to take its vehicle only in case of need and the TER cars have been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned on Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was considered Thursday evening to restrict the weight of weight.
The prefecture "invites all cars to the greatest input on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Director-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested aircraft companies on Thursday 25% of their flights on the Paris Airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to future snow losses.
The DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their company.
In Gran Bretagne, Gatwick Airport, South London, and Edimbourg, in Ecosse, are closed until Thursday.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial challenges
Since the debate about the modernization of transports in Ile-de-France has been baptized, the billions are weeping.
In the least discussion.
In particular, 23 billion are called for the Grand Paris Metro to build the Grand Paris Society.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital contribution of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this sum will then allow the SGP to enter on the markets a part of the funding of its double bulk.
Today, we finally reach the first additions.
This morning, the 2010 Correction Finance Act, examined in the Committee on Finances of the National Assembly, contains the devices planned to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: creation of a special equipment tax and increased tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the draft law, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment of the Great Paris Society".
It is encrypted: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a review of a tax on offices already existing "to modernize it, to increase the product and to affect this increase in the Great Paris Society".
How much would that report?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
"There is stated that these tax resources are 4 billion euros of the capital funding which will be mobilised by the State and are brought to the Grand Paris Society in the case of the project," can be read in the exhibition of the reasons.
At the SGP, we don't find this shocking system.
"From the time in which receipts were created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then tap in the four billion after it is explained."
"What will be included in the budget and shot to the fur and measure."
The SGP believes that the 4 billion will begin to be recorded in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still in absent abonned, can cause a little appealed parliamentary discussion.
First meeting on 7 December.
Hackers winners and spices in love
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the other hand, it appears a scandale, a scandale that appears as a scandal only before the hypocrisy that regulates the reports between the States, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at international level, and provides a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each document constituted by a secret service (of any nation or any) is composed of pressure.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what could be read since months in any journal (excluding those who are owner of Berlusconi) and the Khadafi's increasingly carricatural profile was long ago for the artists of the cabaret to ske.
The rule that secret documents should be composed only of news already known is essential to the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to historical publications, you will see that each book repeated (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Câteau, the Templiers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous books.
And this is not only because the author of hidden texts does not like to do inherited research (not know where to find news about the inexistant), but because those who are dedicated to ocultism believe only what they already know, and who reaffirm what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Ideal for secret dossiers.
The informator is parsed, and parsed (or limited) the head of secret services (if not it can be, I know, editor to Liberia), who rejects just what he recognises.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Ambassade of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as those newsweek was the week before.
So why did the revelations of these dossiers make such a voice?
On the other hand, they say that every cultivated person already knows that the ambassadors, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the leaders of the State can call or take a plane to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and have been transformed into spiral centres.
Any investigation film spectator knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact to repeat it violates the obligation of hypocrisy, and it serves to place the American diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most powerful secrets of the world's most powerful country brings an unnecessary step to the presence of the State Department.
So the scandale doesn't make the victims so much as the "bourreals".
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
So, at Orwell's time, we could design all power as a Big Brother who controlled each gesture of his subjects.
The orwellian prophecy was completely fulfilled since, when every movement could be controlled by the phone, every transaction made, the visited hotel, the rental and soon, the citizen became the total victim of the power's eyes.
But when it is shown, as it happens now, that even the secrets of power secrets cannot escape from the control of a hacker, the control report stops to be unidirectional and become aware.
The power to control each citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the winner of the citizen - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power that has no longer the possibility to keep his own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel said it already, that a true secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret will never be demissed); it is also true, that all knowing about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a empty secret, because the public area is relevant; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks did not wrong Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big in Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound involved in a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will not be able to connect any booked information anymore - it would return to it on a show at the road corner.
But it is also evident that with the current events, it is unexpected to be able to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Nothing more easier than to discover if and when a State leader moved in a plane and contacted one of his own.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for instantly, my prevision refers to science-fiction and is therefore romantic, but I have to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences to uncontrolled travellers, not only as porters learned from heart or, even by hiding the rare information written in the hall of a chaussure.
The information will be kept in unique copies in key-locks: in the background, the Watergate spending attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the progress is now in crab, that is, to recovery.
A centurie after the telegraph has developed communications, the Internet has replaced a telegraph on the son (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogicals) allowed researchers to explore a step movie, walking forward and back, and discovering all the secrets of the mount, while now CDs (numbers) allow only to run chapters in chapter, namely by macroports.
With the big speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in the aircraft, and the moves he includes, we need three and half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policy and communication techniques return to horse cars.
A last observation.
At the time, the press was trying to understand what happened in the secret of the ambassadors.
It is now the ambassadors who ask for confidential information on press.
Climate: how France implied its financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the compliance with the promises of rapidly discontinued funding (these fast start or previous finances) carried out by developed countries.
And the large French hydrogens are reveled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries have committed 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised EUR 7,2 billion per three years and France EUR 1,26 billion per year (420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU went out the big game to convince its partners of reality of its commitment on fast start finance: a detailed report on the action of its Member States, press conferences, large events, brochure distribution...
Transparency operation is appreciated and appreciated to its right value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has deducted 2,2 billion euros in 2010, which puts it on the right path to respect its commitment of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But when we look in the detail, things are more complex.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, this silver must be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort is made without the deterioration of the development Aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, some Member States whose procedure was blocked by France.
Today, everyone chooses the best reference to him.
For example, the European Commission considered as a reference in 2009: international funds are maintained, and it is 150 million per three years under the early start finances.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or levels of development assistance.
In contrast, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of the years or at the global level of development assistance.
Concerningly, the total amount of France's support to developing countries may remain stable (or even reduce), it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional funding"...
Other important elements, the distribution between donations and finances.
There still is no rule and each chooses its calculation mode.
Some, such as France, believe that 1€ awarded is 1€ given.
Clearly, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are rentable (only projects related to the achievement of emissions of more efficient costs), it is impossible to present an euro that will be recovered as equivalent to an euro... In addition, it should be calculated in accordance with its commitments only the cost of the loan for the provider country (or the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France is to make such a reason: she "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check itself.
It is the only EU country to use so massively the loan.
Germany re-evaluates 46%, while Danish, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other cases) respects their commitments with 100% gifts.
In other words, when the great majority of the European Union makes 1 euro to satisfy its commitment, France only sets 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Great passport tour!
In summary, in its rapid start finance, France operates a double crochetry: one part on the development of the action in time and on the reality of the financial effort.
Only 36.1 million euros, she believes that it costs 420 million "new and additional" in accordance with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it is Bercy who has performed the arbitrage) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to provide?) and in the negotiations because the developing countries are not completely duplicate...
The chapter of previous funding is only a small, relatively short-term question, in comparison with climate discussions.
But it could be a more sand grain in the large machine that is UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
Anyway, it is essential to take the lessons of this first year of previous funding.
On the other hand, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other European Union countries.
In particular, France could make further discussions on long-term funding injuries (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the question of "additionality" or the mode of accounting of loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on those injuries as it is on others.
The hope is therefore on the new Ministry of Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which will come to Cancun next week.
A surprised announcement on the fast beginning of France and its view of "additionality" and the use of loans would be naturally to increase the international confidence level necessary to progress in discussions.
Warning for children's pesticides
A 10-year-old child enginees on a day of 81 different chemical substances, a study of this Thursday of the Generations Futures (ex-Movement for the Rights and Respect of the future generations).
It provides that its results "not have significant statistical values in view of the low number of analysed samples, but are illustrative of the problem treated," buyed between July and September the foods consumed in four feeds and an encouragement on one day by a child of a decade of years, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These types of food, including official recommendations - five fruits and fresh fruits, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water per day - as well as frindises, have been examined by workers to search for chemical substances, pesticides, warm metals and other pollutants.
The asylum balance is accumulated: 81 chemical substances with 42 possible cancer or halts and five classified cancer substances and 37 substances that may be handled as endocrinian perturbants (PE), > studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all of the cases, the limits for each individually taken chemical substance are not exceeded, it is well found in our investigation that the reality of the exposure of consumers to potentially cancer contaminants and/or is concerned," it states.
For a small dinner, the beer and the thee contain only more than one cancer residue and three bearing as cancers, as well as nearly twenty residues that are possible to disturb the hormonal system.
The pome, imported from Brazil, which is provided for as a result of the study, presents six traces of chemical substances with a fongicid, however, prohibited in France.
Even for Kenya's green haricots, including on Wednesday, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
Moreover, the hacked steak, the tone in box, and even the bread bag and the chewing gum were truffed of pesticides and other chemical substances.
The analysis showed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms in the robet water.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the exam of the plastic asylum used to recover the food to the microwave was not free.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is probably under-estimated," the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on its side, proposed to establish a moratory on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the employment of civilization diseases".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) stated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the consumption of fruit and vegetables in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
