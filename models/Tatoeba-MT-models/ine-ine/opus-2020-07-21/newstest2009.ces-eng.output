The purchase burst falls to the end of the trade in a negative
After the wounding fall, the puzzle had corrected the loss.
Transactions with the CHEZ actions have reached at least half of the current daily trade.
The puzzle was just on the beginning of the outer negotiation to its moon pass, when she lost about six percent.
This time after humiliation, it's the past of action on Wall Street.
We also have the market reaction to the results of the vote of American Snow Representatives, which refused to support the stabilising plan of the dark financial sector.
Action Path in Asia
The dramatic fall in the cave has lived in the bushs in Asia, even though the indexes were lost in the past day.
The Index Hang Seng in Hong Kong rejected almost four percent during the trade, but the part of the loss was decreased and reduced to 2,5 per cent.
Index Hang Seng China Enterprises, who follows the movement of Chinese actions on the burst in Hong Kong, decreased by 3.8 per cent, markets were closed in Shanghai.
Action in Sydney was lost more than five per cent, but the loss finally reduced to 4.3 per cent.
Though the Thai-Wan's bubble was decreased by 3.6 percent.
"The time of salvation in the United States is uncertain and if it is the financial market worldwide," commented the head of the Hungarian Monetary Authority Joseph Yam.
Hongkong, although it is part of China, decides the monetary policy on its own, so without dependence on the Chinese centrality.
The tax rates of Hong Kong are at the same level as the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudda, the American legislators should immediately return to negotiations and approve the support of the financial system.
Otherwise, it's dangerous that the impacts will also be affected by other countries.
Blood cartridge of American actions
The American Sneemov Representative refused the financial system's support plan on Monday to be charged up to 700 billion dollars (a.k.a. 12 billion Kƒç).
The lawmakers ignored the call of President George Bushe to support the plan.
According to Bushe, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of financial crisis and help to stabilize the entire economy.
The American action on Monday has experienced the blood bleeding and the main action indexs have changed the largest fall in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones' index decreased about seven percent and the pass in the similar range mentioned in 1987.
The index has already fallen before voting, but when it was shown that he didn't pass in the snow, the index felt in a free fall.
Congress: The US government can pump 700 billion dollars into the bank
The highest representatives of the United States Congres and the President George W. Bushe have agreed on a wide range of agreements on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote will be the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators have affected the middle in discussions on the approval of a salvation plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of EUR 700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmans must therefore complete some details of the agreement before they will be able to publish the final pattern of the law and to vote about it.
The financial system's support plan will be negotiated on the ground of the Snow Representatives on Monday.
On Wednesday, the President of the Bank Committee and the Financial Service of Barney Frank said that.
According to the resources in the Senate, the plan could be voted first in the middle.
According to the economy, an announcement should be made for the approval of a salvation plan, the first important psychological factor for the survival of financial markets.
However, it will come to "screening" thanks to the complexity of mechanisms that help the markets to achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be rational
"We made a big progress.
We have resolved our different views about how a package is looking like to stabilize the market," the Democracy Nancy Pelosi reported for the agency Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be reached on Sunday.
The representatives of the legislators met the American Minister for Financing Henry Paulson last night to give a definitive representation of the Governing Fund.
It should be solved from financial companies of non-social hypothetic activity that download financial companies to difficult losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the continuation of the definitive agreements of the plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
There's still a healthy plan to continue, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is clearly affected by the actions markets that each of them fall.
According to the Nevada Democratic Senator of Harry Reida, the lawmakers are trying to reach the definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to quiet the investment before negotiating in Asia's financial markets, which are the first timeline, where the decision of Kongres could affect the Monday trade.
However, there is still no doubt when both of the American Congress will vote on the law or whether negotiations can be able to address the same problem at the last time.
The lawmakers hope that he will be approved in the next few days.
However, the Law is still a variety of changes.
The total amount intended for the system shall be divided into two parts.
The starting 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as the President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress can block the exemption of the remaining amounts if it's supposed that the programme does not comply with its own, and it's following the additional $100 billion and the end of $350 billion.
Bush evaluated progress in negotiations
Although the President can make this decision known, Congress can vote over his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funds for the remuneration of bad hypothetic valuable papers, whose value was lost, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were not able to pay their hypoteches.
"We worked everything.
Representatives should be able to vote on the Law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress in negotiation is also satisfied by the American President Bush.
His speaker Tony Fratto declared that Bush is satisfied with the Sabbath progress and appreciates "the ambitious effort to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economies".
Limitation of golden falls
The President of the Banking Committee of Christopher Dodd, leader of the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the money programme, the protection of tax chargers from loss, the conclusion of the impact, the financing of the plan.
The new law should also restrict the golden taxes for the managers of the company's owners to the programme and set up a committee to be supervised by the Fund.
It should be the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very strongly and we've made a great progress in the direction of the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also calculates by means of the owners of households who have problems with payment.
The government should make new payments for the hypoteque that he buys, with the aim of reducing monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to leave their homes.
Mark: Psychological assistance
The plan is a good idea, according to the main economy of Patria Finance David Mark, but it will be very difficult to achieve it.
"And it is because it doesn't know what mechanism and what price the problem activity will be solved.
This will be a determining way to divide the loss of the financial sector and the government between themselves," said this week for the server iHNed.cz Marek.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of the next week, it is not as important as Mark.
"The more important is that the congressmans have agreed that this plan is supported and that it will deal with it as soon as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement that will come to approval is the most important at this moment," Mark said.
MP3 players against mobile.
We can advise how to choose
While at least every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can't phone.
It seems better to buy a phone only.
Yet, there are enough reasons to arrange a single player.
The choice is completely dependent on the way of use and the results of the future owner.
You're probably hard to arrange home a nice grammophone to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such musical products on LP tables do not cover, and there are no objects of quality.
However, if you are in your rules of wine with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream at least about such grammophone.
It's the same with music on the roads, so music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also prices and quality categories here.
For someone it may be unacceptable to lose for player eight thousand corners, as well as the Pink Floyd's boyfriend may hardly test the audience for twenty corners from the market.
Two extremes, between which there's enough space for everyone.
The choice is width.
Determines also the level of battery
Some music players will be able to make much more than just playing music, but what the number of mobiles or the case.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
According to primary facilities, telephones and emblems, it can play music and video, both play, have better, the worst camera, and maybe it can also navigate.
And when we take smartphones and communications, you'll have a little computer in the caps and the computer.
It's a little miracle, no kidney can grill, and no television doesn't photograph.
The mobile universe also brings outcome.
The more you use on the mobile, so the indicator on the screen will send you to the buyer.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy wounds.
Small mobile can play music longer than ten twelve hours, mostly it's much less.
In this direction, music players (in particular the most simple) are extremely executive.
In the leaving mobiles, therefore, calculate that longer than a few hours they will play you.
You're still here and you're calling there, get to work for sure another buyer - it's also payable for dearer devices.
In MP3 players, you will have this problem, and the worst will take at least 9 hours of unforevered operation for one purchase.
Another problem occurs when playing music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, only the part of the devices is available to the USB Universal Conctor, and not each of them can be directly connected to a computer without a special software.
Of course, music is possible to play directly on a memory card, but only a small read card can be consulted with miniature memory cards that are used in the mobile.
For players to exception (iPod) you do not have any special software.
Adequate device to fill music via USB from the computer.
The majority of mobile and players already creates a music book based on interpreter, album name, genre or evaluation.
Some devices only show the tree structure of directories as well as the Windows Explorer and some can both (ever, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart telephones with the operational system).
Snow players serve, mobiles can more
When selecting a specific equipment, please especially care about the maintenance of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of control.
If your music is mainly a cules and if you are listening to it every day only shortly in the tramvay, you have any phone that plays MP3.
What can already prove to be almost any phone.
You don't have too much to see what musical formats the mobile or player knows.
MP3 will all be able and the simplicity of music that will get to you will just be in this format.
It belongs to the most extensive and other than the simplicity of the devices will also support music in the WMA format.
AAC is less displayed (form used by Apple and its iPod).
Better mobiles also allow music purchase online.
It's enough to visit the relevant pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a falling argument for music mobile equipment.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is disturbable and limits the ability only to the ‚â•volume of hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, usually, it is expected that just this way is to sell music (which is now through GSM, Internet or free internet) to be a future musical development.
The mobility of people is still wearing at itself.
Whenever you get a pleasure to hear something, you take the mobile in the caps, while MP3 player lies forgotten home.
Yet, it still depends on whether you also carry a bowl or at least a road handsfree with you.
No, you can use an integrated player who has almost every mobile, but only minimum MP3 players.
Maybe the biggest benefit of music mobiles will be for many prices.
The most vital is running under three thousand.
For three and four thousand corners, you're already ordering a very honest walkman.
However, most of you will limit the absence of output to a running audience.
The best and at the technical page of the most famous phones and with 3,5 mm for running audiences are at 150,000.
The result of players is a easier service, outside the other.
The most simple - no more important (see our choice) - players will be able to control the truth everyone.
Minimum, the likeness of control with previously running boxes or the grammophone may be visible.
It does not threaten the choices in the form of a mile of the disabled mobile Internet and then the surface for data transfer.
Which Device to Snapshot
Even most important mobile mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) has a place on exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD apod.).
Even by buying the relevant card you'll enter two thousand corners.
But watch it.
Basic models supported only cards with maximum capacity 2 GB.
Only the lovers are to be advised with 8 GB memories.
You already have a mobile and you still want to buy a league MP3 player, go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iryor.
According to Capacity (max. 2 GB) you should not lose more than 1 100 corners.
If you belong to the closer listeners, you will find ra'i after specialized mobile - walkmanech (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsungy).
These devices have a single control button for MP3 and the service comfort is so close to the single MP3 player.
The next is in the area of Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from a series of combatmans have the same interface as sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category to four thousand corners, but with a higher memory capacity (to 16 GB) and maintain the batteries (flow 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) will lead you to MP3 players from the above marks.
The Operator will come to Czech already in the year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech is relatively developed, and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet, we miss something here, a rational operator that would make the classic leader.
Maybe it's missing.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most dear in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
Recently, the CTU confirmed that the SMS price was higher than in the remainder of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on the Roaming Payment Regulation as possible, the paradoxation will take place - for some Czech mobile operators, SMS will be more left than home.
How is it possible that prices in Czech remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxally, we have three mobile networks and penetrations over 100%.
Instead, mobile operators claim that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this case, the President of the Czech Telecommunication Board (CTU) Paul Divorack, who in the past sometimes stated that there is no place for another operator in Czechland.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has no longer too much chance (only, he would just look for frequency).
But there's another option - a local operator.
Just entered the mobile market operators has brought a significant reduction in prices to which the classic operators had to respond.
On the other hand, before the income of a shock like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, similar votes were in Great Britain as we.
But it appeared that the place for such operators is and that they can be successful.
We don't have to walk too far for examples.
In February of the year, we informed you about the start of the Mobilking Operator in Poland.
In just a half of the year, this operator could get more than 100 thousand clients and become the darkest five largest operator.
On the other hand, there is a Penta financial group who is owned in Czechland beyond other U:phones.
The advantage of the operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, they have many less clients than classic operators.
They do not have relatively high costs for building, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world such civil operators are usually profiled as low-covered - they offer leaving calls and SMS, which is often exported by a good offer of services.
So the Tesco Mobile in Great Britain will offer SMS at least half less than his competitors.
But as it shows an example of the Mobilking in Poland, it can be a very good shot and an unexpected target group.
This operator is also focusing on men's specifications.
"The administrative guys call Mobilking - a operator who loves and can trust them," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company operating this operating operator.
It's hard to say if a similar concept as in Poland could be catched with us.
It doubts that the printing speaker Vodafon Miroslav ƒåepisk: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment access on which the majority of operators are found.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in view of the service offer."
In Czechland without a chance, mobile operators say
But it seems to be sure that if there's a mobile operator in Czech, it's Mobilking.
"We talk about the expansion of this successful project, but in Czechland, negotiations are not too sensitive.
Moreover, it will come to launch Mobilking in other countries of our region," she said in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studentiƒá, the printing group of Penta.
She just so confirmed that the existing mobile operators in Czech were not determined to be determined.
Instead, he's trying to do everything so that no potential competitor has been destroyed.
Interestingly, the GTS Nover's group has no longer been launching a mobile operator, which would like to make another step to become a real O2 telephone competitor in the fire client field.
"We have great interest in it, and our clients could offer not only strong, but also mobile telecommunications.
And what I've done before, it's better.
We reacted on this option with all the Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already been able to continue together," says the printing speaker group of Paul Kaidl.
So maybe it's blind for better time.
Inofficial information seems to be expected at the end of the year by the first official operator.
In the meantime, but his exhibition is going to carry out an unprocessable silence room.
"In this moment, we do not believe that there is a Czech market room for the exhibition of a full-valuable operator.
The Czech market is very specific for other markets.
Before we had no entity with a complex and series project in this section," he introduced in his review for Mobile.cz Vlastimil Ssze≈à from the O2 Printing Committee.
The specificity of the Czech market is revoked by other operators.
The printing speaker T-Mobilu Martin Kemr adds in a rare agreement with O2: "We have not yet recorded any life-based and extremely valuable business project on which it would be possible to continue to build."
And adds, "In the T-Mobile network, a hard operator will appear until the end of the year.
At this moment, they had to have a specific agreement on the table so that it could be considered in this short horizon."
Vodafone takes his attention rather than to comply with the requests of the own 3G licence.
Miroslav Czepski says: "We are opened together with potential operators, especially in the share of costs and infrastructure.
This is just what we consider from the view of the clients as the most important.
The Vodafon Strategy in this Area is finding a partner for the building of a shared network for the mobile Internet."
Responsible Authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the income of another operator would mean increase in competition, lead to the reduction of prices and also to reduce their profits.
Why, then, to facilitate the approach of such a competitor?
The fact that when the operators are about something, they're going to go for one test, they're witnessing and tachynics around the U:phone.
Apparently the biggest pressure towards CTU went in the time of U:phone from T-Mobile.
It shall testify publicly accessible information from the CTU website.
But now, U:phone is running as an argument why the operator doesn't allow.
Martin Kemr said: "The competition of the mobile market was recently enhanced by the input of the fourth mobile operator on the market.
In view of the characteristic of the mobile market in the RC, it is evident that the income of another player would place high requests on its services."
In view of this access to mobile operators, however, it is directly injured by the Czech regulatory authorities.
However, it is not only about the position of CTU, which, despite the Czech Republic of Great Britain and other developing countries, has no power to include economic competition.
These belong exclusively to the Economic Concurrence Authority (OCS).
But the whole problem has rejected his typical position.
"The entrance of the mobile operator on the mobile market would be possible after the closure of the ability between the mobile operator and the local operator for the finding of the necessary infrastructure.
No such conference has been closed afterwards because the offer of potential interesters was probably not interesting enough for classic operators," said in the answer to our question Crisian Chalupa from the UOHS External Relations Committee.
It is likely not surprised by the representatives of the operators.
From the agency to represent the interests of consumers and, otherwise, it is more than on the market concerned.
Especially when Christian Chalupa adds: "In the record where the operators are working running, we can notice that their marketing income has contributed to the reduction of prices for mobile phone services."
Of course, the pressure for the correct market rubber operation and the price reduction is not to the UOHS interests.
In fact, shocking in all cases, three mobile operators resulting from their reactions are too famous.
A question if it's just about the case, it's totally alone.
Like the totally the same price of benzine in shopping stations, it is certainly only the part of the accident and the strong competitive fight.
"The Authority in this matter did not look for signs of anti-social negotiations, so it does not have a way to contain.
None of the operators has dominant position, thus does not have a higher responsibility for its market negotiations.
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile market for operators are probably agreed to the telecommunication regulator," he said in his review of Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversy points.
It is evident that there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by the CTU, which provides telecommunications in view of the economic competition on the single market.
On such market, obviously, no of the Czech operators has dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer another view - to the result of the operator, it is necessary to agree with the network operator.
And the mobile operator - has a whole logic - on his monopol network.
So in a certain segment, it must be dominant.
Even when they did not allow these arguments, the UOHS should be at least warning that three mobile operators are the same.
Instead, the complaint of a number of interesters (including GTS Novera) shows that when negotiating with all operators, they are very similar.
The validation of responsibilities to the CTU is, then, in telecommunications, a relatively covered truck that UOHS gives away from the entire affair of hands.
We've met him in some similar cases.
Despite recently adopted new telecommunication law, the extension of the power of the CTU to the economic competition in telecommunications was not able to proceed, though a number of experts had since promised improvement.
This must be the representatives of UOHS to do more than well, but of course their interests are elsewhere.
It's going to be when no one looks
Instead, without notice, the functions of psycho-virtual operators that exist in the Czech mobile networks are just a few.
They're firms who provide their own prices for mobile phone services, which are publicly only partly.
It is also about a multilevel marketing company.
Your own mobile phone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The prices of these fires are usually getting only to the chosen.
Kouzlo is conscious of the company against the operator as a classic fire-leader, which provides a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant client then will receive special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that trade submins of all Czech mobile operators are prohibiting similar re-selling.
"When the cases you're talking about appear, it could be a deterioration of contractual submissions to which they have been involved and who could go to the end of cooperation with the company," she answered our question to Martin Kemr's problem.
But it is not likely to have a similar activity to the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of three fires mentioned may be about thousands of prohibitors.
None of the operators, however, doesn't delay such a procedure.
From the activities of these fires, they have inconsistent benefits, and they are, in the case of the operators, no one threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav ƒåepisk warns possible problems: "The Law allows similar speculation, however, the service of these fires only uses an insufficient percentage of clients.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not guided to their name, so they cannot be available with it as a remote client of mobile operators."
But it's just supposed to be at least strange.
Moreover, there is a further question for UOHS.
If mobile operators are over the similar procedure of the eyes, why are they blocking the exhibition of the operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has a relatively strong power to discover similar activities, and if it wants, it does not have to be satisfied with the explaining of operators that they do not have any idea of them and their business submissions prohibit it.
When we're going the best
As sometimes in the text, the income operators on the mobile market have made a significant reduction in prices for service.
Instead, practices in all countries where the operators appeared were trying to protect the classic operators more or less.
They used arguments were practically identical - too small, if possible too saturated markets, problems with the quality of services etc.
In developing countries, however, just at these moments, regulatory authorities, which have never seen the interests of mobile operators, but their clients.
Whatever formal measures or non-formal pressure have been achieved by the first operator and have been packaging on.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities overcome the whole case as a heat bramber.
From our experiences, we cannot be able to discern that the uncleanness of competence is more than they do in these cases.
But let's not put the flint in the wheat.
The legal information is correct and the operator is actually present in us soon, the Czech mobile market may be moved again.
Some of the operators authorised the exhibition of a mobile operator, only the UOHS will be able to remain inappropriate to refuse (discrimination) of other interesters.
And we should stop calling the road before the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymna has four new versions.
Choose the best here
Listen to four reviews of the new version of the Czech State Hymne.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek at the occasion of the Czech State's Day celebrated a new record of the State Hymny Where my home.
Hymnu rebuild the National Division orchestrar under the lead of Jir√≠'s White Chamber.
There are four versions - with a single song, in the congregation delivery and instrumental versions.
The song was taken by Catherine the priest and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn adjustment are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krƒçek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
The white clothes considers a Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymen.
The Czech vote already said that he had chosen to sing solar variants with young representative voices, which are extremely and favorite.
"From the beginning, I came to both, and then he also tried to take care of the congregation to have a dictionary in order to understand the text well to understand," he said.
The Czech State Hymne will celebrate 175.
Song Where my house was first in 1834 on the bridges of the Stavov's division in the pool of the Czech Fidlovaƒçka Joseph Cayet√°n Tyla supplied with the French Schroup music.
She got popularity, and people took it spontaneously for herself.
In 1918, after the presentation of the Czech Republic became a natural part of the national hymne.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the establishment of the Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymna sounds
Prague MHD in the middle of the first link and on the chip
Meanwhile on 1 October 2008, the carriage of the transport undertaking shall be recorded as the date when the metro, the tram and the buss will delay the first travellers, which will have in the cup of the box, instead of the paper boxes.
At this moment, he can arrange a hundred thousand people who own the opencard chip card.
Traveling can buy a 30-day and 90-day and a year-making buy (they will pay from 1 January 2009) and leave their chip card in the info centres and workshops of the transport business in the events of the Muzeum, Muzeum, Municipality, Training Hole≈°ko, Angel, Roztyly, Latvian, Kobylisy, Russian Garden, Kachers and Luke.
Company can also be bought through the Internet since yesterday on the Web sites www.dpp.cz.
The service was used in the afternoon hour over four hundred clients.
Those who start using the Internet trade can definitively forget the outcome window in the metro stations where they have to stay regularly in the long fronts of paper boxes.
The purchase also buys through the Internet and on the Opencard card they will play it in one of the thirteen book books.
"In these places there is a traveler with a school service that will help the interesters with the Internet purchase and also replace the purchased buy on their card," said the speaker project Martin Optrowy.
Along with the books, you will also be able to play electronic buffets on Opencard in self-service machines that are mounted in some meters.
How's the cars looking like that?
They're red, they're on the travellers and traveling them may already have observed in the districts of the metro rostyla, BuÊúàovick√°, I. P. Pavlov, Florenc and Vltavska.
"Now they are five in the city, but until the end of the year they should be eighty," added the Watchful.
Bupon checks the location of the driver automatically
The service of machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
It's enough to insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bupon is replaced on it.
Electronic buffets pay not only in the main town but also around it.
Then, in the townships and bus lines with 300 to 499, leading mainly the people of the Mediterranean communities to the main city.
"In the vaults of the Prague integrated transports are the nicely equipped with the caret readers, which determine the time and pseudo validity of the bupones," explained the control of the Philip Drapal of the Ropid organization, which builds the railway lines of the puzzle.
Approximate buses have a reading card built in a suitable driver.
So when you come, it is necessary not only to show the chip card of the driver, but also to add Opencard to the specified place on the side of the box.
The driver will check the validity of the refrigerators.
"When traveling to verify the validity of the feeding bupones, there is nothing easier than requesting the driver about these information," Dr√°pal added.
Travellers who don't eat the buss and remember when they finish their acquire, can return to self-service machines where the buying on the card is packed.
The information on the validity of their documents shall be shown in the display of the devices.
Sudety wanted US references
In 1945, the Judean Germans asked for the conclusion of Shumava to the United States.
It's from the letter stored in the assemblies of the Jihochesche Dec Books.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Russia, we want to live at least under the pattern of the United States.
With such a desire, some groups of South Germans returned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This includes otherwise a letter that has been maintained in a private holding and is now stored in the assemblies of the Jihochesche decade books.
Germans from the Czech Krumlov requested in the letter of the American President not to allow the return of "shumava's shops" - prohibited by Hitler on the basis of the Mnichov Agreement - back to Czech Slovenia.
"We have made the right understanding and we want to be certain of the words that the American units will not come into German territory as the threateners and enemies, but as the liberators," it says in a letter signed by the words "Men who are judged with the heart."
Since the connection to the Czech Slovenia is given to the South Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech National Powers - only for brutality, independence, disapproval, anxiety and slavery, the authors of the American president's letter to overcome a Protector for the present and contemporary time.
"We can't believe that you would have recognised this territory without the view of a fourth million people to a foreign country, who presses and eliminates minorities and nothing, but has not reached anything to the winning of the Communities," it is written in the letter.
D.D. why the authors can't sign, it's evidently both of the "Cheeck's attackers".
The chairman of the United States would, of course, doubt about the thinking of the Shumba Germans, have enough to organize a referendum in the Summit Jump about whether its people want to be part of the United States or live under the patterns of the United States.
Although the text of the letter can sound a little naive in today's knowledge of the rubber, some memorandums advise the expectation of the Suded Germans appropriately.
Even though the Czech Germans had to think at least that it would be about their derogation from the Republic, only a few of them had allowed that opportunity.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain negotiated a certain type of autonomy to the Courts.
Others believed they would just stay in Czechland.
It also confirms the glorious race journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Republic of Czech Republic.
It was for wars as a boy German, designed for the Baltic Sea.
When the Brits took him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holland, the decades of the final Czech Germans followed him to take them.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would be honest to walk," said Chalupa.
No of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czech Slovenia, according to the fact that it would be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Benez Decretes.
You don't think - you're paying!
Emoti‚Äôs campaign attacks the driver
The most dear action is focused on security in the streets in the Czech Republic.
It would also be able to characterize emotions of the media campaign that has been able to start the Ministry of Transport in the middle.
The Minister Alekshe Rebicca's office promises that he will deliver the drivers from the dangerous behavior of the volant.
The camp in 150 million will appear in television, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The driver should be driven from the cow and alcohol behind the volant.
And remind them that before they come out, they should be admonished.
He wants to be aware of young drivers, engineers, travelers and professional drivers, especially.
What's going on in the back?
The main human history that attacks emotions.
And the testimony and the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you're paying!
The word "doesn't think" is written by big letters on the spice.
And then in the blood caluge, the word is "paying."
This must symbolize that a man can pay his own life for the choice of an insight.
The divs will be "fearing" until 2010.
The Ministry was able to inspire the campaigns in England, where the images with drastic images of accident victims can be watched.
He promises that the accident and the dead in the Czech streets are so decreased.
The meetings were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and bottle on drivers
"The driver's the sugar system and the bicycle.
The sugar for them is, for example, when they go on the red, it's gonna take time.
It's a threat of repentance or accident.
The drivers must be risked," says the transport psychology of the hospital on Homolce Martin Ko≈ô√°n.
And therefore the need for information campaigns in printing and mainly negative advertisements, less psychological.
There are already less effects in accordance with the table, which warn the drivers of danger.
"When the statistical table is installed to warn against dangers, it probably soon combines with the surroundings and the drivers will have it," he warned Korjan.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas of exchange for peace
The President of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert expressed the practice of all the territory occupied in 1967, thus the pre-Jordan, the East Jerusalem and the Golan Height, a exchange for peace with the Palestinian and Syria.
He did that in a conversation that printed the journal Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We have to return to the agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return at least all (built) territory, if not all," Olmert said the journal.
"We have a certain percentage of these territory, but the Palestinians are going to have to put a similar percentage (Israel's territory), because without this peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, doesn't want tractors or buldozers to take his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up the parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the wound of two July attacks in the city, in which some people were killed and ten people were hurt.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the temple mountain, a holy and historical place", which lies within the Old City.
"The one who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
"It's going to work," he admonished.
Department from Golan Height
Olmert also expressed the department of Israel from the Golan height, which is, according to an unrepentant submination for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require certain efforts from Damask.
"I don't want to close the peace with Syria only on the basis of Golan's department," he warned.
"The Syrians are well-doing what they will have to give to get Golana.
They will have to give their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give their relationship with Hizball√°hu (the shiit movement); they will have to give permanent support to the terrorism (scale movement) Ham√°s, (Terrorist network) Al-Kaidy and Gihada (heaven war) in Iraq,‚Äù the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after failure: Are stewards illegal in the bus?
The law is not known, walking in a remote bus doesn't have to.
With regard to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Padove, the question was whether the stewards and travelers could be moved after the bus.
"When they wanted to keep the law strictly and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the Road Operation Act," says the speaker of the Transport Minister Karel Hanzelk.
The accident that last week the twenty-year-old steam was lost, apparently caused the driver of the cost vehicle that crushed the bus.
The girl at that moment was sitting near the driver, at least safe in the vehicle, although it has been replaced two other places.
However, the bus can heavy, or swimming, even in the moment when the stevard varies of coffee or newspapers.
The role plays whether the bus is equipped with the technical display of places to become.
It is not approved in the bus, the traveling must sit.
The remote buses Student Agency are not available; what has been confirmed by Radim Janƒçur's manager.
"This is what we and the Ministry resolved and the movement of travelers was not allowed first.
Afterward, they revoked it, and we learned that travelers were able to go to the bathroom, if they had their seat," he reported his advice.
The Law of Stewards doesn't know
"There is not a unique legal explanation of the role of Stevard - no legislation shall solve this role.
However, no legislation prohibits neither the operator to provide services.
The road transport law only knows the termin of the driving vehicle; its rights and obligations are not defined," adds less uniquely Hanzelka speaker.
The Chairman of the Management Committee for the Transport Ministry of the Transport Ministry, however, states that the Law's problem is sufficient.
"It depends on whether the bus is authorised in the approval.
That ends," he says.
Business works in towns where the towns are located and deployed by the maximum ability, the interlocutors with a higher permitted position and the remote outside with the highest authorised security and seats.
As in the aircraft, the expert says
The BESIP expert on transport security of Jaroslav Horien in the movement of stewards on the bus fuel does not see a fundamental problem.
"Where the driving has a lot of dangers, it can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
It's not sure here when turbulence comes and the aircraft can go into the head."
"Now, if the bus is broken by the bus, naturally, the physical laws are payable.
Like in the town bus or tramway.
The safety of controls must be resolved by the transporter's internal rules," he says, as well as a minor, the problem is not solved in the view of the law.
Janchura is willing to cancel the service
Student of the Agency offers the service of stewards as the only bus transporter.
He works on two hundreds of them.
The Director does not even consider their accommodation as a risk.
"But I'm going to realize that it's a risk call, so I'm dismissing it.
Coffee and newspapers can get travelers at the coming.
It would also be the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexi Litvin has declined the absency of the stewards in his cars, which operates a broken line in comparison with the SA.
"We have no stewards, we're standing against it since the beginning.
Before or after it ends a mortal level," he said a year ago for Week.cz.
There was an unmarried tragedy
In the accident of a linking connection to Neapole, a young stick from Plze≈àska was lost, who worked for two years for the company.
The Slovenian truck probably split out without using a guide from a depth and locked the bus road.
His driver was trying to avoid a manevre, but he was invoked by the right front part.
That two places were sold for the rest of the stewards, Janƒçura refused.
"This place is not possible to reserve, they're blocked."
The company wants to complain the driver of the truck.
With the damage of the girl's family, the agency is waiting for the court's order, but the financial refund is expected by the winner's side.
Editing the law?
Independent
The enlargement of the stewards on the bus bottle could lead to the adjustment of the law on which a thirty-year expert group works over the year.
"They did not come to any specific conclusion.
Business doesn't solve too much, more than the point system, the maximum rate on the remote and the mobile use of the driving," expert Horien says.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of controllers for something that would primarily threaten the safety of travellers," concludes speaker Hanzelka with the power of the police and security offices of work.
In D√ºsseldorfu is Frankfurt
The major words in the letter of WestLB are missing to the employees of this bank.
The combination of the units of this D√ºsseldorf money institution with the French Deka-Bank will result in "the central institution of the financial group associated with trade in the markets", let's read in the letters that have been published on Monday.
WestLB, in accordance with the letter to this transaction, will introduce a "kompetence-base" which ensures the cost period.
And, in all, such connections may be an impulsory impulse to further association in the country banks sector.
Such texts appear when a representation wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a difficult period.
The instable WestLB is still under significant pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Social Authority for Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the Government in North-Westfalk is still clear that it is time to find a future solution.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which the clients are able to know about its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever any sort, however, are talking for a longer time - even on the French side.
Boss Deka-Bank Franz Waas, when presenting half-year economic results at the end of August, let him hear that in the forum of his bank house from the Landstra√üe with some of the land banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, he does not see sense.
The Deka-Bank Governing Council, for which one half of the country bank and the other association, has, however, confirmed the representation of the management of negotiations with WestLB on common business activities.
This may be about trades on the market or part of them.
However, the discussions have just started, and the financials are undertaken.
Deka-Bank, which belongs to more important employees in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not first talking about consolidation in the public sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba bank could reach.
There was nothing from this triple at last.
Soon after the pupil plans had been reached, the Hesenian earthquake government was expressed against the Helaba bank.
Not both white banks have been connected.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, instead, obtained Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg from Stuttgartu.
However, the Deka-Bank connection speculations were repeatedly discovered.
However, in recent times, G√ºnther Merl, the president of the Bank of Helaba, was negatively expressed to the speculators on the connection of his financial house with other.
However, it seems that, independently, it is convinced that the closer of different banking houses of the public law sector is needed.
Now after the elections of the earthly snow in Bavorska, the BayernLB connection with Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg could begin to rise first.
This isn't just a good news for Helabu.
The pressure should be increased for another fusy, and the possible partners for such connections are progressively added.
On the south, it would only play the second hostel, even though the financial crisis is far better than the banks in Mnichva and Stuttgart.
The connection with WestLB again at the beginning of the year prohibited Swaz associated with Hessen-Th√ºringen Hessen-Th√ºringen, which has a 50% share in Helabia.
It would look like this as the highest North LB.
The geostrategic views of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is the question of how many business models of individual institutions are shiping together.
In June, Merl stated that the decision-making question of the future competitiveness of the countries' banks, the German Union has not yet been able to respond to the Jewish banks.
Everything could also end with the WestLB divorce that, of course, no one is in this institution.
Therefore, in the letter of the dark representation, it is also referring to "complete solution" for the whole bank's house.
If and how it will be possible to connect individual folders to Deka-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of October is known as "weeking with Italy"
For Elena, it's the first, for Luke's territory or quarter.
But this time Elena will be like his girlfriend, and so it'll be all else, he says.
After them, at the Fifth Court of Caiser's mark, there are a stronger tissue and two hundred tourists in October shows how deep tons can educate his horse.
Elena Luca's first dancing and then loves him.
They came to Verona from Bolone.
From here, from the bus parking near Puorta Nuova, four buses will go out this evening at 23.45, with the label "Destination Monaco, festa della birra", prescribed income 6.30.
Three buses are in particular Italians, and in one bus they are going exclusively in Brazil.
In one corner of the park, these Jihoamerikan songs with their flat, celebrated in the night.
And that's how a vote, Marcoguard says, it's nothing for Italy.
Marco, who has a long cab with a width of the skin's imitation and bleed with a wide silver wheel, belongs to the three buses.
He's running with them for five years to October, only in the aeroplane there are three adjustments.
On the night there, a day between the beer stations, at 22:30, go back.
Overnight would only mean unfair costs, he says Marco.
The road is 75 euros in the chair of the beer Kaiser, accurately covered by the Bavarian Library on the purity of beer, health insurance and German speaker - Marco walked in Frankfurt to a language course.
The buses go out to the night, on the road to Brennero.
The beer doesn't give it, not yet.
The bus is slow, the traveling sleeps.
They're doing good, they'll still need their powers.
It is located in Brixena and Holzkirchen, where the remote number of 8 boxes before Mnichov makes another Breakfast and with other buses with the Italian recognition mark.
When the Mark's group finally comes to the park near Theresienwiss, there are about 50 other buses from all Europe.
Elena, Luca and the finals gather together, Marco's last show, explains the plan of attack.
First: Build a yellow bottle.
On it the left side of the swabach is written "Oktoberfest", at Marcovy's Internet address: "coscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the door is opened to the beverage apartment, run!" Marco calls to the wound air.
"Stop!" Wait and put places in the back of the apartment.
"I'm not forward, not for you to tell, and not for all the yellow bottles on the same lay, move around the room!"
It's eight euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget what's wrong.
"Tell the securities that we're doing.
When you leave your places, they are gone."
Third, "This evening exactly at the middle of the eleventh, be here again!" Do you understand?
And upstairs to Wiesn, the room with the drinks.
The road one member of the group refers to the yellow bottles as labels on trees, cedules and even on the electoral plaque of one large bathroom side.
We need to prepare for access.
As the weekend with Italy, I know the second weekend of October.
Exact information on the number of visits is not available; about fifty thousand of those who are released in the travel through Alpy and fall into beer states, ten percent of all visits came from Italy in the weekend.
Seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support Bavorski red cross in which the Italians before British (approximately 60 resources) and Raku≈°ana (ca 80) with approximately 200 medical medical treatments are the first place.
Especially the favorites are at the Italian Hofbra.
Unfortunate night for Believes Hypo Real Estate
For a week ago, Peer Steinbr√ºck's Social Ministry's Finance highlighted that the German Bank System is relatively stabil.
It's good that this policy has used the word "relatedly" and has also been involved in its statement that the German Bank's sector will not remain in the crisis development.
Because the next weekend happened.
The Dax Index will receive a financial house specialised for financing the eligibility of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from the consortium of the German banks in a number of billion to protect the market turbulences.
The person notified on Monday said to the Agency Re¬©s that the credit aid would be up to EUR 35 billion.
It will have to pay the Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only with the exhausted amount.
The funds are probably covered from private and public rights banks.
The background is lost by Depf's daughter company.
According to the newspaper report to the projects on which the money was paid, this state financial was extremely shortly refined, which is now impossible for unbelieving in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank reserve was 95 % in EUR 2,37 million and the share of its own share was easily decreased from 1,6 to 1,45 per cent.
Current expenditure and pure expenditure from financial trades in the past year were decreased to zero, the expenditure from the increased value of payments and of certain values and the decreasing of the credit trade reserves have also fallen over 70 per million euros.
Only thanks to the higher costs of the refund for the following calculation costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the replacement of rates according to the tax line and for the increase in the trade for counterparty undertakings, the sixteen percent decrease was still dead.
The former State financial officer burned in 1990 after his privatization, on the hypothics for animals, which were then collected from the portfolio of services and continued to carry out Aareal Bank.
Since classic state financing was too small, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private investors and State (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
From the value of your daughter's company, Hypo Real Estate has to describe something and these replies will have "the basic weight effect" to calculate profit and lose the whole group, as some have been uncertainly heard.
I mean it's that the dividend's.
For 2007, two thirds were decreased.
Hypo Real Estate is a significant financial of State and infrastructure projects since Depf's receipt.
More stronger than other institutions depend on refining on the inter-bank market because it does not have any income of clients.
After the fall of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, two weeks ago, the practice has been exposed to interbank credits because the banks keep their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually for the part of the credit portfolio Depfa - ca. 50 billion euros - short-quarters for refineration.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial need for this group is for a period of depth and the company is protected "with the effect of international money markets at the moment to a significant level of non-capacity".
Other sources were allowed to hear that the refining of these money has been guaranteed until the end of 2009.
The President of the HRE Georg Funke, however, declared that the Hypo Real Estate Group should use money markets at the appropriate time.
The Competitive Bank and the Society for Financial Services (BaFin) suggest that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group is now insured on the market.
That's what the shareholders and the creditor banks hope.
However, because of the dynamic and insufficiency of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the credit should not be completely exhausted.
However, it could not be recovered.
After the bank stood before the incencies on Sunday after the afternoon, he couldn't be preliminary, saved in silence.
The course of action was 75 per cent per EUR 3.30.
Instead, the obligations were well held.
While the priority debts have not been taken in practice, the debts of the secondary obligations are lost more explicitly.
This is mainly the commitment of the former daughter of W√ºrttemberg Hypo and the logical obligations with the period of payment after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate obligations appeared to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability is needed after a significant deterioration of the bank and the crisis of a single institution, which has introduced it to the company over the Depfa, to understand depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the banks, governments and less achieved business banks will support a voluntary system, it is possible to calculate the payment of valuable papers during their payment period.
However, it can also be done to what almost no one has been rejecting the hope - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be convinced.
However, in the light of the reports which are present at the same time with this partial deceit, the probability of the conversion is now only authorised.
This is especially for the believers, probably, will prepare a number of distressing nights when they will decide whether their commitments will be granted.
The short-term investors may use the border part at least to create a loss from the previous annual periods to the currency costs for the future payment of taxes from the expenditure.
Sylvana and the secret of the box beet
When the sixty-year Sylvan Hiltrop's first day at the middle school in Tachibana, girls will begin to be encouraged: Germany is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows this word already from Mang. In his new blog, he tells about Japan.
"For the day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been sent to school from the way.
I'm living on Tokia's country to Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes in the middle of Tachiban.
I had to find my way alone, for lucky, I didn't lose myself.
It seems that the beginning of learning on Tachiban doesn't have been given so closely as at our home in the Down Sask.
Students will start meeting after eighth hours and twenty minutes ago the nineth starts a short meeting with a factor, e.g. 'home room'.
But before I started study, I had to imagine.
I'm not the type of man who speaks anyway before people, but before the class 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I took my old hostel mothers on me, to the blue, blue, and black skin bottles.
So I was set before the lavice, and I tried to say everything right, "Sajonar Wo Sylvana..." - I'm Silvana, I'm coming from Germany and I'm born for a week.
At that moment, I was too probably that I started to start the language for two years ago.
All 31 holes in the class were swimming, chichotal and mavalo, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
That's what I already knew about my mang.
It belongs to the basic word resource of Japan's girls needed to survive and it means 'free, sweet'.
Then I went into my place.
The girl near me was a little big smile, thinking to be honest that she had to sit at her.
The rest of the hour was very quiet, but when the gong answered, I've been cut off.
They talked about one another and chichotted and asked me as possible as possible, and then it's seriously difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then, everyone was packing his beet on the stop.
My host mother also made me such a box for dinner, and that's something else than the poor German basketballs.
I had a rise with birds, a little pair, a salat from a bullet and a row, a fruit and a coffee fish in the tofu.
Most of all, I don't know exactly what I'm going here in Japan.
These things look specially, and they're getting too new.
Of course, everything's really good.
Well, maybe on the snow-sweet, Br.
Benta at Japan's schools are not just a meal.
Sometimes the girl gives the boy handly prepared beet, which is in this case particularly modified by the artist, and hopes that the boy knows nearly about the breakdown.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm aware if I'm gonna see it here too.
"Why is Japan?" My friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I said,
'Cause he's just fascinating me.'
Finally, I've been reading manga for years.
And to understand better these comics and their culture, I started to be Japanese once.
So I was absolutely saying I'd have to come here once.
Because I also have weaknesses for traditions, habits and habits.
And they're high prices here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the newest rubs and trends, the other is cruel, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything's so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokio's the biggest city I've ever seen."
And the cross has feelings
When the cross or fashion runs from danger, does it mean that they also feel fear?
The neurology Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify whether they feel the same when they go like us?
The Internet "E" magazine has published the contributions of known doctors for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series represents the selected answers to the question, "What do you think is true, without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other statuss, without me or anyone else I can prove it, if we can't even prove that homes have the last people.
But in this case we can at least hope, because all human brains have a coherent fundamental configuration.
However, when we continue to act on another kind and open the issues of imagination or generally home, we enter into an inconsistent territory because the hardware does not agree.
When the cross gets in danger, it will do the same as many other animals: it will be expected to be dead, wounded or attacked.
People do well similarly, from which some of them are identified to comparable entities of life.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure facilitate the transfer of our corporate life to animal life.
It is, however, because obstacles associated with humandom almost include the backfrontal prefrontal cardex (for its part to short-term memory and execution or guidelines).
This complexity is developed in humans more than in the final primates, and it seems that other creatures are totally missing.
At least in the aspects of our home, which depend on the prefrontal cardex, including who we are, and who we are ability to plan and decide, there is a matter of thinking that man is even different from the final priorities.
Another dramatic speciality could hide the language foundation of a man: because so large part of his imagination is connected to the language, it is often said that the domain depends on it.
In this case, the animals could blow out.
But even if the language doesn't matter, the tongue would certainly affect it, so the animal domain would have been designed anyway, probably different from the number of our status.
That is why it is difficult to see how it seems to be in the final animals.
If, like something inside and entity, it doesn't even give us any satisfaction, because of a special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, it will make us his examination before big problems.
Most of my conclusions are related to the area of a homelife, but there are other aspects of the domain which should be accessible to the deck of snow.
It would be possible for the processes of animals to examine without regard to their areas, and it is precisely a short memory in the studies, especially in visualization.
But this access to Christof Koch and Francis Crick is more focused on the neural corelates than on cash mechanisms: both can be identical, but they may not be.
It is interesting that this approach also highlights the importance of non-frontal cardex for the implementation of visualization.
What's going on for feelings?
I'm exporting them from that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is active in the brain.
What we mean as "fear" is, then, a mental condition in which we are situated when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its followers, such as the body reaction) will use operational memory.
Seen from this angle, the feelings of anxiety are conducted with those cardexes that are marked by primates, especially people.
In connection with the language naturality, there is an amazing decline of imagination because by means of words and games we can distinguish and category states, and they have also been added to others.
In contrast, Antonio‚Äôio believes that feelings result from the most primitive activity of the cardex and the brain-related physical feelings, such as Jaak Pankseep, which, however, is more focused on the brain generation.
Since this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could be quietly shared in the feelings of many animal plants.
I can't just resist the theoretics, but I think it's not proofable.
Pankseep arguments that what we have in the cross and people are as fearful, they probably feel the same: But how is it possible to verify, says Pankseep, do the cross and people feel the same when they are like cho?
Is he also feeling afraid?
From my view, it can't only be the likeness of behavior to demonstrate the conformity of life.
It is true that neural comparison moves us to: cross and people have similar brain tribes, contrary to the fabric or the brain.
But is the brain tribe responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it to man, how would they show it at the cross?
I think cross and other sheep, maybe even weeping (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably in principle different from those of us (for human houses are based on special circuits and languages), I consider emotional behaviour than emotional creation.
Everyone in this case can wait for an advance to the neural level if we are going to move the same way in the cross and in people.
Like in the cross, I don't know the language and domain, I don't know whether they exist.
It's possible to put it as a short-screen, but I'm going before I'm repeatedly against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President EUFA Platini: Friday of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparation will soon lead directly to President and Prime Minister.
"The Government views EUFA decisions in Bordeaux as a evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"For our country, but it's not amnestie.
The work just started, and in both countries it's still much to do."
In the regular performance of the time plan of building or setting stations, streets, hotels and aeroplane, both hosts cooking.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose time.
We must now work as far as it is," said the President of the Ukrainian Union Grigorij Surkis.
"EUFA will continue to follow us."
More radical step was voted in Poland.
The leading of the Poland Union PZPN was revoked by the National Olympian Committee and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlockim.
The Board meet at the request of the Ministry of Sports of Miroslava Trevic.
There is a "severe danger that the PZPN is able to act in accordance with the rules", said the Trewick Poland Print Agency PAP.
"President EUFA Michela Platini we have made a letter to ensure that this step does not suffer preparation for ME 2012."
A number of teams of the first body were only in the past for the manipulation of the needed concentration, finally it had to be even moved to the beginning of the league.
Bad Dennis Quaid returns the author
She wanted to make an advertising a new movie, talking about private things - and now she has problems with her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaido as a divorce of marriage.
The shooter and returns the wheel.
The battle of war runs in the former female couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaida: Seven years after the divorce together these two hollywood herds are leading to a great disaster - before the air of public.
Meg Ryan, in a conversation for the American magazine InStyle last week, went to his wife's breath: "Dennis was a long time incredible for me, and it was very painful."
She was probably learned about the range of subwaters after divorce.
In addition to this soul, stripthez was the PR work of Ryan for her new movie "The Women" - that tells the story of a divorced marriage.
Denise Quaida's reaction to his presentation as an unbelieving wife was clear: "It's crazy," said the four-five-year herc of New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly excited the history of our relationship and managed it."
Moreover, it is "political" that the joint sixty-year-old son of Jack again "is publicly in pain and radical changes to each child's divorce."
While Ryan lives alone from divorce, Quaid is married again and has been a father of two times ago.
His views on the movement are as follows: "My life is going on everywhere.
I think I'm lucky to have a famous family that is great."
Aeroplane prices and hotels are lost
In the first half of 2008, the years and residence in Europe were more flexible than in the previous year.
In Germany, the years under one current study were even less than 50 percent.
Years and apartment in hotels again badly - this is the result of study of American Express travel and financial services providers.
The company analyzed its data on the reserves carried out from the first half of 2008 and, after the prices in the first quarter, it resulted in their significant decline in the second quarter.

Because of this trend, American Express considers a weak course of a dollar that caused the "free delight of American tourists to travel."
The reduction of hotel prices was also stronger at the financial centre than the industrial center, such as Hannover, Kolin over Rin or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, the prices of hotels with their growth of 26.3 per cent even changed the European record.

For the purposes of the delivery of kerosin, traveling in the Economy class must have paid more than 7,1 per cent than in 2007, even 29,2 per cent for fuel fuel was produced.
From April to June, the airport prices in the Economy Economy of a average 12,5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, however, in Business and First-Class classes were less significant.
In Germany, prices were more exposed than in other European countries:
From January to March increased by 11,9 percent, in the second quarter, by 23,6 percent.
Dutch national years, according to the quoted study, the prices were even reduced by half.
One of the debts for this price fall is a deteriorating economic growth, explains the company.
The request in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure for the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized the aircraft between the United States and Europe.
The characteristics of the inflammation are the disruption of the unfair lines of air transporters and also the high number of aircraft companies that were reported in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it was 24 aircraft companies.
HSV Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets into the head of the table.

Dark weight affects the years of universe sond
Years ago, they don't know the advice with one mysterious phenomenon: Dark weight affects the quality of universal sonds during the manevre swing-by (gravation practice).
Experts are afraid that Albert Einstein's general relative theory should not be completely correct.
Almost 18 years a world sondae "Ulysses" was flying in the universe.
The wine of the burning leads that will soon be hungry now threaten the death of the winter.
A mysterious phenomenon has been killed for years - anomalie of gravitation.
The gravitation process is a aircraft of universal sonds, with a additional deficiency in the gravity polypolicy of the universe, such as the Earth.
The sonds can save a lot of burning.
Cassini-Huygens, European-American research investigation, used this fisic trick as the Ulysses Sunday.
What, though, has been recorded for years in this case in a miracle: the flighting body is not to be gradually as the man would expect according to an old gravity law.
On the contrary, it comes to unrighteousness in the world.
Sondys are unexpectedly discovering or relaxing.
Before physicians could not explain this effect.
They baptized him anonymously of gravity.
A few experts are afraid that even the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of the weight of the area, should not be completely correct.
The American physician Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein has not hated, and is trying to explain anomalie of gravitation practice through such a dark weight that the presence of the universe has been astronomed.
"The responsible for this anomalie could be a dark weight that could also be seen very close to the Earth," he wrote.
On the existence of dark weight, the universe researchers are about about ten years.
It obviously comes from the gravity force, which is my observation of the other universe body.
She is, however, totally invisible, which means that she doesn't even reflect any electromagnetic records, just or visible light.
According to the calculators, this dark weight is a good fiveth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists are free in Egypt
After ten days in the hands of their employees, the Italian Ministry has announced that the tourists will return to their freedom in Egypt.
The contributions from Sudan requested a number of million euros to be redempted.
When the shooter was killed before the release, six incomes were killed.
Five Germans were brought south of Egypt.
The redemption is already running.
Germans are repeatedly to the goal of the contractors.
WE√â ONLINE provides you the most important cases.
Europe's tourist attachments to Sahara are likely free.
The Egyptian state TV, the Arab TV station Al-Arabia and the Italian media were informed of this.
The Italian Ministry of France Frattini, according to the report of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24, confirmed: "Our partners and final hands were released.
We're just checking their health status," said Frattini.
According to the reports of the Egyptian State TV, five Germans, five Italians and one Romania and eight Egyptians are well and safe.
All 19 posts in the wilderness are already on the road to Kahira.
The rest remains the back of the breakfast before the release of the hands: According to the eye of the Egyptian security work, the income were ready to finish the income even before the Sudan Army murdered overwhelmed six income.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the redemptor," said the citizen worker.
"It was just to take over the hands," when it came to "This surprise."
The soldiers of Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six incomes on Sunday and two of them.
The contributions asked for Germany's redemption for six million euros; the money should be given to the German woman of one of the hands.
The journal "El Masri El Jom" with a call on one of the German prosecutors indicated that the release of the hands is disturbing because the insects are afraid of their security.
According to this report, the income wanted to leave the hands of the woman's seed after the payment of the redemption.
The men should be held until the income had a safe way.
The German ambassador in Cahira refused to report this report.
Injury with the face of "leaving to self-mortality"
A few-year injury in my father led a woman to kill herself, and he was deceived before the court.
After accepting eight cases of sexual disappointment, the seventeen-old Michael Treris from Stithians in Cornwal was judged for six years.
The Corn Court in Truro heard that she's daughter Stephanie Randle regularly joined her when she was five to seven years.
"I feel responsible for her death," he wrote in knowledge.
In the court, it was also said that Mrs. Randle was killed in her home in Mutley in Plymouth on 1 April 2007 at 34 years.
When she lived in Coventry, Treris binded her eyes and then sexually dismissed her while her mother worked in the field.
Treris and her wife were divorced in the 80 ‚Äô s and returned to Cornwal.
His unusual daughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the court, Mrs. Randle, who spent a substantial part of his time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, followed the example of the disuse, which was two times to the week.
Ramsey Quaife in the court said in 2006, Mrs. Randle's friends, who also were very surfing and cyclistics that she was "emotionally dead" and that "they've lived."
In April 2007, her father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It's judged that she's hurt with the igelite sack.
Randle put his face in his own father's face, who wrote a knowledge that ended the words, "I bound her and lifted her eyes.
"I didn't use her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, "You're extremely strange femalesist and for your victims it must have been cruel when it was just seven years old.
"This inappropriate story ends by taking life.
More horrible is that if she did not, the thing would never have come to the judgment."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the effects that I had your crime on their daughter in those years, according to Stephanian parents," added he.
"Of course it would be a promised, successful and happy young woman."
The Officer who lost data will be accused
The BBC realized that the Governing Board, who had left a closely secret documents in the flag in June, would be accused of the State Secrets Act.
The person concerned left two extremely secret documents in the Waterloo flag at the time when he was temporarily assigned to the Defence Ministership.
The documents were received to the BBC before the police were transferred.
It is at least a serious offence against the law mentioned and does not indicate a criminal purpose.
The BBC writer for Defense Affairs Frank Gardner said that this is a surprise for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was going out internally between the Ministry and the Government Authority," he said.
The employer not appointed shall be charged by section 8.1 of the law concerned, which is a clause to protect information.
The Corn Prosecutor recommended the Metropolit Police to complain on the basis of a very sensitive consideration of his work in the Joint Rapporteur Committee (Joint Intelligence Committee).
The documents that he forgot contained secret analyses of Al-Kaida and the possibilities of Iraq security forces.
The decision was informed on Monday and was moved from home to an unknown place.
Company funds of B&B debt debt
British partners‚Äô funds may have to arrange for more than 80 million dollars after Bradford & Bingley's salvation.
The Government has provided 2,6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion dollars.
The contributions of this payment will be paid to all companies which take customer contributions, including 59 company funds.
The Director-General of Association of Company Funds (BSA) Adrian Coles said he was "incorruptible", that the funds and their members must pay.
Finally, the fourteen milliard debt will be paid by salvating Bradford & Bingley hypoteches.
However, the payment between the years will be paid to all 700 financial fires which take customer contributions.
The Compensation Fund for Financial Services for BBC confirmed that all 59 company funds were started in this number.
It is humiliating that these institutions that have been carefully treated now must pay some of the institutions that have not been so valuable.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the income she had, and that the funds had to pay about 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of growth in 2009 is EUR 450 million.
This means that the funds will have to find 81 million billion billion billion billion billion to overcome rates from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of Company Association, said BBC is convinced that it is not just.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that have been carefully maintained during the expansion of the housing market must now pay some of those institutions that have not been so respectable."
According to BSA, no funds since 1945, when they appeared, did not.
"We'll have to examine all the aspects of this thing during the next few weeks, and they have seen the possibility of protecting partnerships and their members from which they could be essential," added Cole.
The date in force in 2009 is covered by seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, the amount will be paid for the whole year, and it could be almost twice so much.
Since the funding partners are shared organisations without shareholders, these shall finally pay their members by higher taxes or lower amounts to their shareholders.
Milk delivers five pens per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey's milk reported that since Monday, the price of its milk increased by five pens per liter.
It is a second growth of prices, after double-country delivery in February, and comes after investigation of the advisory company carried out.
Small trade operators have to decide whether they want to reflect the trade in the prohibitive prices.
Before renewable growth, the big trade price of milk from Jersey changed in 2002.
Building for Bangladesh explosive rejected
The Bangladesh court rejected the request of the former Prime Minister Shach Has√≠na Watched for purchase, which means that if he returns to the authority, he can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to leave her in the case of an accusation that she had received from the actual employer over fifty million (729 700 dollars) when she was a premium.
The case is one of some of the accusations of corruption that are against it.
Chalida Siea, the old political rival of Shaich Hasina, was previously released on the bathroom in this month.
Shich Hasina has to return to Bangladesh during the next few weeks, but her side, Lid liga (Awami League), requested her local armies to give her full freedom.
The writers say that while the honest word has been released to be able to reach the medical progress in the box, it is not according to the submission of its release if she remains in freedom until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that the High Court is now calling for the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request of Shaich Hasina to buy with that he would not cook when it was already undertaken the investigation released for honest declaration," said her response Rafique-ul Huq.
"In contrast to the Court of Justice Regulation, we are rejected."
Her lawyers claimed that √Çe buyed to be able to return to the country for preparation for the election.
The High Representative of the League of Lid said she's gonna return home after October 17.
It was arrested last year after the military held by the temporary government has overcome power, but it has been released in June to be able to take a medical progress.
Shech Hasin and Chalida Diea both refuse all the accusations against themselves.
The fear of waiting against the opposite in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200 000 children have not been involved in a recent flat expectation against the opposite to the violence associated with the Taliban.
The United Nations has been waiting in six provinces last week.
However, she says she couldn't get to a child in the southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The United Nations speaker noted that it also happened through the Taliban's promises that there would be thousands of people's work to attack or protect them in the work.
BSkyB spent the ITV courts
The BSkyB has undertaken a judicial dispute on the review of the Commission's decision on the economic competition, which has ordered the company to reduce its share in the competitive transport company by ITV.
The Court of Appeal for Economic Competition for BSkyB ordered to reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % under 7,5 %.
The Commission declared earlier that the BSkyB share had a competitive fight and had an improper impact on the company on ITV.
BSkyB bought a share in 2006 in the trade that was in the result of the NTL, now renamed to Virgin Media, ITV.
In April 2007, the Agency of Justice notified that the BSkyB share in the ITV was a reason for doubting the independence of the ITV and invited the Commission for the economic competition to initiate the investigation.
The Consortial Boss Virgin sir Richard Branson, the needed organization and the official regulator of Ofcom were all against buying.
BSkyB argued that the needed reduction of its share in the ITV was incompatible and as a disproportional solution - especially because BSkyB had previously said that it was voluntary to give its voting rights.
New investigation of American lawyers' affairs
The American Master State Representative appointed a special complaint to examine the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
This came to the time when the report on the affair made by the High Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officers.
The report criticized the officers of the White House, the legal officer and the former Minister for Justice of Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was emphasised by the fact that the lawyers were removed from political matters.
The special complainant Nora Dannehy will now examine whether the officers of hearing during the investigation lied to the investigators with a view to dealing with justice.
General Inspector Glenn Fine said in the report, "The serious order of potentially criminal negotiation was not completely investigated or explained."
The name of a special complaint with the ability to deliver the witnesses was one of its key recommendations.
Spor started when the American Justice Ministry delivered nine American lawyers in 2006 with their own.
At that time, the Ministry concluded that the lawyers were released for weak performances.
However, it was shown that the release of lawyers had not been evaluated for anything worse than many of their colleagues, which led to the conclusion that the release was motivated politically.
Some of the lawyers were invoked to deal with the highly established Republican Affairs and Senators, and others refused to investigate the complaints against the Democracy.
The American lawyers investigate and conduct complaints in court cases for government.
They may be released at any time, but they should not be removed from political matters.
The higher head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, has reached under the ground and finally rezignoused.
A number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The report of the general inspector was very critical to the role of Gonzalese in the February, saying that he took "loud responsibility" for release, "abdiking" from his leader position and in fact "not carefully involved".
Other officers, including former Bush's adviser Karla Rove, were criticized because they did not work during investigation.
Meat Loaf's command will be evaluated
The Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the prices of Q Awards for his epic hymne Bat Out of Hell.
The song, who for his special gold price will come to the ceremonial next week in London, said he was "respected" by obtained recognition.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
Nomination for the year of a year leads to the Coldplay group, which has been taken in four categories in the outer selection.
Paul Rees, the main editor of Magazine Q, said, "They are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed a big voice that offered Meat Loaf.
She started the instrumental part, which was about two minutes.
The song was published in Britain in 1979 as a song and at the top of the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out of Hell was holding around nine years and sold it throughout the world more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, whose name is Marvin Lee Aday, suffered health problems in the past years, was also operated in 2003 because of an irregular heart rytme after he was collapsed on the ground.
In 2007, the acute laryngitid forced him to cancel concerts.
After that, it was shown that he was on the voice cysts.
Obscure streets, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, districts and other earthly communications, some praises, others only useful.
But even many taxi-veteran and locals have difficulties when they can find extra Place, mostly because they never heard about it.
This small street is in the quarter of East Village and leads north of the Prince Street - without getting on the Second Street - between Bowery and Druhou avenue.
At the width of approximately ten and a length of 40 metres, it will be overcome from the transport travel.
There are no cedules called the street.
The current atlas is practically invisible.
However, the street has a stranger.
For example, Avalon Bay, developer of recently built Luxury buildings on the street.
He wants extra Place to redistribute and create a cleaner way to business and bottles that can be opened in new buildings.
Other strangers are the events of the neighbors who say that they were rotated on the street just because it was one of the last residues from the time before the block was cut off.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of the Guardian, which has a street in its power, does not have the least interest to keep it.
At the meeting of the General Community Committee, the representatives of the Civil Authority and Avalon Bay were planned to buy a plan for the developer to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the Ombudsman of the Common Community, the committee predicts the warrant when the street remains in the hand of the city and requests a new plan to be given next month.
"The city has only been very few lands, and ÃÅddi ÃÅ to stay extra Place in his property," she said.
"We could have been given to the work and administration that Avalon could do, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that he wanted a small street to re-speak and set out the places for the session from which she would use some of the caf√© whose interest for the finding of the Space developer is expected.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, speaker Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, he doesn't want to own it.
"The aim of Avalon Bay is to make this lost wallet and make a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale was to the city.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the Agency for Warning, said that the city actually wanted to sell the street, and he understood that the task of his office is to develop more than to manage.
In comparison with his higher neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a little trace in the history.
Some people think that the street was given their name in 1802, when the great farm Philip Minthorna was divided between some of his children and no one had done a deceit on that strange country.
To Extra Place, the back door of the CBGB, the pumphouse, which was closed in 2006, and the street is the most known as the background of the image on the album of the Ramones group "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was insufficient," says Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who made it in November 1976.
"There were full of waste, sprayed clothes and bars, plaquets, sheets and kitchens."
Some local, including bloggers, who write about east Village quarter advertising, stand against the idea to sell extra Place and claim that that the cuss of public property, being cool, should remain public.
Others consider extra Place as a rarit - at least unchanged town cup that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes the blog named Jeremiah‚Äôs monthly new York (with the subtitle "The book of the Nights: the bitter nostalgic view of the city in the middle process"), explained a part of the story about the extra Place from the Rubrik Talk about the city that appeared in the New Yorker newspapers in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a very blind street, dark even on the day, and covered by the raw railway doors of funds and closed windows, where the old news is spent in the streets a week."
Until a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening looked totally the same.
The cross passed through the blind end of the street near the door that had ever led to CBGB, where the trade with the lovely clothing is today.
On the wall there was a graphfite and a white-dose of the newspapers was a blank beer.
Some of the surroundings said that the extra Place thinks sometimes, but it seemed that he could have been able to walk.
In contrast, Fields said that they think some people underestimate the activity of the bullet in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "They were in dark, low and opposite places."
Billing Value Debates: Increased in English
In this rubrik, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Isumi will discuss the position of candidates for biling.
Lance T. Izumi, a akademic worker from the California and the Education Director in the Public Policy Institute, is together with the book "Worst than you think: why the Mediterranean class chooses schools".
Effectively celebrating the Spanish electors is an enormous matter.
The training agenda Barack Obama just proves that.
Obam's campaign subscribes that "afro-American and Spanish students have substantially less probability to study than white wheels," which is the truth.
In order to fight such artistic differences, Obam's educational agenda is particularly designed, otherwise, for those who first learn English.
The question on Barack Obam remains, however, if his commitment to the biling education, which claims to be used in class other languages than angle, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance distributions.
Let's take an example of Sixth Street Prep, Charter Base School in Los Angeles East.
The students of this school are in absolute cases of His√Åncis from the underground family.
More than the third students, from whom many recently arrived, are learned in English.
However, in state tests from mathematics in 2008, the highest level of incredible 100 percent of quarter classes.
At the same time, ninety-tree per cent of the fourth classes were reached at the highest level in state tests from English and English.
This incredible success has been achieved by another method that Obama prefers.
Sixth Street highlights control and accommodation, continuous consideration of capacity and access without excuse.
Next, and that Obama should notice, according to Lindy Mikels, director Sixth Street, is a pedagogic access to school for those who are learning in English, "complete proudness".
Increasingly highlights the primary use of angletics in education.
Mr Michaels, who is against the Billing Education, said to me, "We had a huge success with one completely new shot from Mexico - after twelve months you would enter into the class and not eat who it is."
"It works," she said, "It works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a pattern, how should other schools look with large Spanish and English students?
The conclusions of the school should be taken into account from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (National Education Association is a dual-scale representative) and its own consistent support for the double-lingual education denied the response of Obam.
While Obama agrees that the promotors should be an English, he recently trivialized the thing when he declared that people should stop taking care of "only epical" laws.
Instead, "You should make sure that your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama wants to remove the performance differences, it should be more about the educational patterns that work, think carefully than to smile and trivializ them.
Renewable economic threats
The prices of the roof on Monday have fallen to fear that neither the American plan for the salvation of the financial markets would have to survive the economies.
The prices of termified trades with rope were decreased in the wound trade in the New York Commodity Burge to 7 per cent per 99.80 per barley.
Since last Monday, the price was over twenty dollars per barley.
In the past two weeks, the markets with comodits were disturbed by financial disasters on Wall Street and two strong uricans in Mexico.
After a maximum of 145,29 dollars for a bar in July, the price was fallen before this month to 90 dollars per barley, so that the financial markets were re-covered.
Uzz reacted to investment on Monday, even after the President of Congress announced that the weekend has reached an agreement on the greatest salvation plan in the history.
This report was deceived with sincere fear that the financial crisis is far away.
In the latest episode, the government announced that the Citigroup group purchased a bank of the Wachovia Corporation company.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Netherlands and Lussembourg government had partly conscious of the European financial conglomerate of Fortis.
Analysers of Barclays Capital said that the last weekly negotiation that led to a plan for the safeguard of the economic, "seems unable to survive the market."
As the economic facility is deteriorated, it is expected that the request for the comodits, including the ropes, falls down.
"The overviews for the markets with global actions, rates and monetary currencies were strongly distorted," the Deutsche Bank's analytics wrote in the report to investors.
"We believe that the commodities will be able to avoid the orders.
From the commodity perspective, our greatest age, in which the American virus will spread throughout the world, especially in China."
The analysers of this bank have limited their expectations for the next year, since the need of the rope was decreased due to the latter growth of the economic, and have reduced their estimates of gas prices for 2009 by approximately 20 %.
The Divote Road in the second quarter overcome the record of the team
After he walked in the Jets dress in the last eight seasons more than anyone else, the defenses of Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then on Sunday, he followed the development of the second quarter, in which Jets changed the ungodly game in a spanish wheel.
"I never saw anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizonian Cardinals were equipped with the dark darkness over them.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Colese to a twelveyard touchdown sprint, which finally indicated the afternoon, in which their progressive development cooperation moved about a mile forward.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter after two other touchdowns, including the cornerback, and the next 10 seconds before the half of the storage.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre said about all his funeral to Coles.
"It's a good player.
It was good to communicate to us, that people think anything."
While Favre and Coles were thrown, the defense attacked the Cardinals Kurta Warner's quarterback.
Cornerback Darelle Revis took a blowning road and returned it 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric'ith printed another game and arrested it.
Linebacker David Bowens used Warner to fum.
The last loss of meat, fumble that Bowens made was likely the best.
The Cardinals team reached 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets received the meat from the cup, Jay Feely, a twenty-yard of the field, whose leader was 34-0.
That's the most of the Jets got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini when he was called to describe this crazy, he said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed on Thursday, 21 points without answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I used much more than the third.
A lot of points fell in a short time range."
Rejoiced Bresselassia enhanced his world record
Haile Gebreseleassia, from Ethiopia, showed again why many believe him as the best remote run at all when he overcome his own world record on Sunday in the Berlin Marathon and became the first man who had spent 26.2 miles a long bathroom under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasant board travel at 2:03:59, he overcome 27 seconds in his previous time 2:04:26, who passed the past year in Berlin.
Bresselassia, whose is 35, created 26th world record of his career, which is incrediblely large - convinced the world record or at least the world's master at all distances from the metrical miles per maraton.
Last month, Bresselassie left the olympian marathon in Peking because he was afraid - from back looking too scared - that the polluted air is too disappointing his problems with astmate.
Instead, he promised that he would run to Berlin.
In terms of perfect submissions - sun and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in the goal - wined on Wednesday, with a bright average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mil.
What travelers like Bergeselassia and Paul Tergat from Keni were focused on a longer tragedy, the marathon record fell in the past decade for more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil wined in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday winning, he told the journalists that he had two weeks a chariot in the boat and left a week a train.
The pause was obviously surprising him as long as she stopped.
"I'm so happy," he said to the reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little doubt today, but everything was okay."
He was also criticized - mainly in Keni, the Eastern African Rival of Ethiopia - because he planned his convictions overwhelmingly, generally avoided the world's marathonic spices, covered the waters, as if it were a leader on the street, and made world records over the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce the great running quality of Bresselassia.
Kenyah was held at four times, and he reached the half of Bresselassia at 1:02:04.
After the leaders had fallen, two elite chinese running James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi were spent in the 19th century.
About something before three miles before the goal of Bresselassia, he took and fled to Kwambai, who then reached the second place at 2:05:36, and so improved his personal maximum for about five minutes.
Camathi ended the third at 2:07:48.
In the festival, a woman ended the seventh greatest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Miquitenek, a parent from Kazakhstan, now a citizen of Germany.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
The sixty-year Mikitenek surprisingly wined the halls in London's marathon at 2:24:14.
The Peking games left for something that was described as a hurt behind, but she rejected and wined in Berlin and in the third maraton that was running, improved its personal maximum for about five minutes.
She was running wise and thoughtful: she left the fourth Ethiopic and Chinese running into a great spring and then reached it about 18,1‚ÅÑ2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia arrived at 2:21:31, and Helene Cyprop from Keni ended the third time 2:25:01.
Heavyness and interruptions of the lives of black in a separate city
Hidden between the distress of the parking park of Orland, a few miles from all the wooden, low and furnished, is a silent city in which the fierceness and ambition of the African life.
Eatonville, the first totally black city, which was added to the state and where Zora Neale Hurston was guarding her childhood, is not as easy as she described it in 1935: "Instead of five lakes, three croquets, three hundred broken skin, three hundred good flights, enough cutting, two schools and no schedule."
Now it's a busy place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Etonville Festival Zora! to put the Hourstons, the most famous women writer of Harlem Renesance.
The city that she described remains on the side, even though she made a delay for tourists by incorporating it into a florid tourist board created by the Federal Writers project from the period of economic crisis.
It's still so independent, mild and private as it was in the thirty years when Hurston wrote that the foreign black ones often were dismissed and did not share their feelings with a white man who knows so little about us that they don't even know what's going on.
Today, in the year when the Black Presidency candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for a open debate on races, there remains many of the people now looking at strangers' views.
"We take a great attention to how our story is talking," says the 59-year Hortens Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the oldest fertility in the city.
"There must be right."
Eatonville was characterised as paradox triumfu and weapons.
It's like a historical model of black rise, so the community is nearly 2400 people, where the poverty's rate is double-progressed by the international prospect.
It's the central, but also the depths of the shaded example of the Southern Foreign Culture - sometimes oppositioned, sometimes glorified - which came from the American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the people now are as fierce, so protective.
And the concerns about Eatonville were actually started until Zora, which is the only way Hurston's name is here.
She presented the world her family city through the heartful books full of words such as "Mules and Men (Muly and men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (their eyes followed God)" (1937).
Five subparagraphs of the florid tourist spring changed the town of the town to the road No. 17, which leads through the often limited centre of Florida, in the podium of black history and human drama.
With the extent of a big bubn in life and in literature, the Hurston readers brought into the business of the first etonville older Joe Clark, and then returned to personal places.
"Left at the street," she wrote, "is a white white hole of modern national school with well-contained courts and games of the old Howard Miller, even though it doesn't have much to read or write."
She also mentioned the new wife of Dash's widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and everything that matches the hour hotel."
So in just some hundreds of words, Hurston Eatonville joined himself, but also with insatisfactory, rebuilding records and sex.
This was evidently not the typical Fodor's packing.
It wasn't a portrait that everyone would evaluate.
"He said it as it was," says Ninety-years Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson's girls, which Hurston's influenced the immortals by feeling men who sang about their beautiful songs.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
In Hurstone, she still looks like a chipper center, which often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
The seventy-five-year Augustus Franklin assumes that when she arrived in the city, she reached without reporting in the bitter Chevroleth, washed and weared calgots in the city, which is also fierce to a great clothing today.
Most of the people were fascinated, said Franklin, but many were hurt.
"The people of Zorucky have seen," said Franklin.
But, added, he's throwing on the wood on the back terrace, looking at the Sea of Sabelia, where Hurston was with the greatest probability of being baptized, "never remained too much."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from printing.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten the rest of the world.
Despite a literary star, the present Langstone Hughese and the only black at Barnard College in the 20th century, it was buried in an unsignified grave in the Florid Fort Pierce, where she lived before.
In Eatonville there were no more ambitional or large public reading.
"I think they didn't understand its importance for the world or its link," said Valerie Boyd, the author of Hurston's lifebook "Wrapped and Rainbows (Zabaleno in spirits)" issued in 2003.
The change came in the 80 ‚Äô s of the 20 ‚Äô s.
The representatives of the Orange County period wanted to travel to the city of five-produced distances instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is local two-county main road.
Orland's resolve has already been broken through the west side of the city.
We came in the time when Eatonville was still reached from a complicated history period.
Nuclear integration, together with other things, has ended the relatively idolatic isolation of this community.
In the fifty-years of the 20th century, he hated race mixture until community.
"In that time, a park of white boys, they came and threw the leaders and things on people who were sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"We actually had one lady that killed it here.
They went out of the meloon car."
In the 1955 journal The Orlando Sentinel doubted the request for the Supreme Court of Justice for Nuclear Integration and his decision in the case of Brown against the Education Chamber that it was "for my race increasing more than celebrating."
The population now states that the degregation of schools, even when it was in the equivalent places, reduced the cohesion in Eatonville and underground the courage of the younger.
"The Black Children were usually on objects - I remember it - you took your teacher, you took your teacher tonight," said N. Y. Nath, the daughter of Elly Dinkins, and the Executive Director of the Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save the Eatonville Community).
It was a long time when the artists and the boys entered from the same place, she added.
"You don't care about your white factor, because your white artist - I mean there's a cultural barrier," said Mrs. Nath.
Civil rights, however, helped to create a room for many other Zory Neale Hurstons - black writers, herds and artists, who like she had raised up the prejudices with easy self-conscience and citizens, for example, "How can anyone be able to devour my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker visited the unsignified Hurston grave and began to fight for the survival of her story.
In five years ago, he came to the police in the bookbuildings of Hurston's highlighted lifegraph from Robert E. Hemenway, who reordered her to the American Canon.
The project with the wallet reached just on the moment when the most honorable daughter of Eatonville found a light ramp again.
The former neighbors of Hurston now considered her a saver.
In order to show what could happen to destroy its debt, the community began planning the Hurston festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans have reached the in-building action for two years of start, and every ice will return to celebration.
The state has been destroyed after a few years from the damage.
"The five springs of the valley were raised up, you would say that it was right from the civil hero," Nath's said.
Boyd said that simplerly, "Eatonville saved Zero."
Victory over the remote project helped to change the image of the city.
As Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started walking into the current castle in 1993, began to be discovered in a more numerous number, and the people began to review the past.
Eatonville joined the national history record in 1998.
The new single-patch book (obviously named after Hurston) was opened in 2006 to the reasfalt and rebuilt Kennedy Boulevard.
Today Eatonville remains a florid anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orland can sometimes act as a falling street in the yearly rain as small as when it was found with only 27 black families in the 18th century.
(They're 90 percent black today.)
With strangers who are coming to search for stories and significances of Eatonville, they are still often convinced.
The authorisation for the processing of conversations is necessary to have before and some things - as the native malves in the oldest etonville coasts that designed whites and showing blackness on the fields - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, self-determined factor that has a red network, are still afraid that their isolated community is correctly understood.
And even as Hurston's festival increased, the home herois also increased.
In particular, young people run to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with problems and so, but not better, not worse, not the same fierce, creative, workful, divorced and diversified as other American races and ethnics.
From Franklin's son's voice, Edwin Harvey's eighty-year-old son, is a genuine love for foreigner when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in local government or in the police, which says she would use aid.
And even younger, such as 11-year-old winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonow, as it seems, learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"The majority of people, when they're just going here, will think, "Hm, this city's nothing against those finals," Alondra Kenon said last week after the bones.
"But when you stop and look at a moment in the story, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all talking gasfully.
Nothing changed for the first look here.
If the tourists at Manhattan were keeping away from newspapers and television images on Times Square, they wouldn't realize that they stood at the weather.
They would never assume that the Offices on their heads in the past work each day have banks and investment fund managers who monopolize New York, the worst "what's day in the office" from the crisis from 1929.
The carriers are still stuck with coffee vehicles after the grades and transfer the muffins to the dinner meeting.
His ships are still moved between the jars and wear, like human mules, fifty railed coasts, which rise from the vahadel on their backs.
The office crises are still waiting at front of their ransom bagel at the street's eating stations, and it is still impossible to get in the entire day of the yellow taxi between the fourth and the seventh afternoon.
It didn't seem to be a crisis until I, with all the words of pessimism, decided to put up on Monday afternoon.
Although I've had this task to hide with the late afternoon seat on my JP Morgan Chase local bathroom, there were about twenty people in front.
Not before the past windows to get up or store the preparation, but before the overground where the elderly clients are acquired of check books, the tourists ask the way to trade with the mixed goods of Macy's and the new clients are put in place.
Most people before me, as I learned from Starra, my "personal banker's face", came from the same way as me.
However, they have already chosen their efforts from smaller banks in places where they came from, for example, New Jersey, Pennsylvania or State Island.
They chose money from the so-called thrifts (a little similar building partnership), money collections and the types of co-operatives whose bags operate only in one country, which claims that their clients are concerned as a family.
In the next year, 15 of such banks were increasing.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, to the concurrence, and when the New Yorkians returned home on Wednesday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with assets for $440 billion, tried to catch a salvator.
The officers and business officers who were standing before me and fearing another colleague moved their preparation to the bank, which is designed as a safe station and which makes salvation on Wall Street.
The usual New Yorkians have learned gasfully in the last week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket talked to the phone and expressed to Lehman Borthers, who was increasing, and to her extermined top executive worker Dick Fuld, with such a library as if she cared about the line of a college.
And Lyn, an uniformized volume of my fifty-year household, changed the topic of our usual conversion - Brad, Angelina or my food advantages.
After my visit, she said to me, "I now have my efforts in the money market funds.
I've moved it, I can't risk."
Muslim graves devoted by the rackuish right crime
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Russian right side of Freedoms and Philip Dewinter from the Belgian right side of Vlaams Belang with the manifestation of the "Citizens against Islamization" in Antvereh on June 17, 2008.
There are no cedules similar to transport marks that show the mixtures by the red line.
Police accuses the right extremists of the exhibition of Muslim graves in Russia for the same weekend, in which extremely right parties have achieved great benefits in general elections.
More than 90 graves in the town of Traun near Linz was sometimes distressed between the Friday evening and this, and the police were convinced that it was organized.
The vineyards accepted some Jewish symbols, such as David's star, but the detectives are convinced that it could be tried to mask the motives of extremists leading hatred to the Muslim immigrants.
It's not possible if this incident was anywhere related to the choices.
The islamic communities now said that they are "deeply shocked" reports about the destruction that comes at the moment when it approaches the end of the Muslim post month Ramad√°n.
In the meantime, the Croatia enters the search for his own soul after the transport of yesterday parliamentary elections.
Both national rights parties, obtained more than 30 per cent of votes, the Free and Swaz for the future of Rakous, led a major anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were criticized as xenofobics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Freedom Party, who received more than 18 per cent of votes, protested in the campaign against shoes and bursts, and even showed his opposite to the eggs in which the relationship with Islam was expressed.
At the last meeting with elections in Viden, he spoke about the "European Brothership", which is to protect Islam's accession.
Both parties are trying to prohibit the building of mixtures and minerals and argument that these are the political symbols of the islamization of the Russian and Europe.
Research and analysis carried out immediately after elections which have put extreme rights on the position of the most strong political block in the country indicate that this change was caused by young electors who care for their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't fly outside the border
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who was deceived for sexual injury of children, prohibited the court to visit to France and Spain.
The Officers rejected this six months prohibition to Glitter after he informed the Monitoring Authority that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent Police was appealed to the trial on Thursday after the Officers had given evidence of the past sentences of Glitter for the sexual use of children.
Glitter, whose own name is Paul Gadd, did not participate in the Ashford Latest Court of Justice in Kentu, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyers.
The Court of Justice said: "In June 25 September, at Ashford's latest criminal court, the Kentic police requested a regulation that would prohibit Mr. Paul Gadd to cross the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd didn't participate personally."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the office that he wanted to travel to a foreigner, as it recorded him in the register of sexual attackers.
He must notify the offices if he wants to travel into the laptop for more than three days.
It must also give the planned date to the police a week ago.
If the obligation to inform the Authority may be judged for five years.
The Kents police noticed that it was to negotiate the individual cases of Glitter's possible ways after the period.
The Kentic Police said, "The Kentic Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or in the foreign.
In our view, it is easier to follow someone who remains in British, because we have a vast system that is more efficient for potential dangers.
Protection of the Kentu people is the highest priority for the Kentic police, and we work carefully on it, and they followed the conduct of mentioned sexual attackers, and thus decreased any danger for the public to minimum."
Glitter returned to British last month after he spent 27 months in the Vietnamese processing for two girls in 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he fled to Bangkok, where he had to go to London for years.
But he said he didn't feel good, and he refused to flee to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him go through pass control and finally fled to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he went back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officers continued to return to British.
On August 22, he finally arrived to the heathrow terminal 3 and stayed there while his legal representative David Corker went to Uxbridg's latest criminal court in West London and now Scotland Yard requested a order that he had been registered as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was previously designed four months in the United Kingdom for child pornography property.
The resource of the Ministry inside said that Jacquis, ministerial inside, is quiet and implied that Glitter was prohibited in the traveling to France and Spain.
"For me to catch the character, I'll photo my master outside the scene." G√ºnther Bauer - photograph
No subcutaneous, no call or costume.
Only the essence of the big masters of flamenc, rejected from the concentration on interpretation - just so completely released expression of man or woman.
On the one side of the artist.
The second is a man.
Unexpected, if we move privately, in those moments far away from the public - then we can see the trustworthy gesto, the depth of the flight of a embraced view or the dark gesticulation of hands, which are uninquired, because they are not able to go out on the scene.
German G√ºnther Bauer covers the theatreality in the "Flamenco-people" with songs, dancers and cytarists with the less known face of the masters.
With this purpose, the photograph consists of a unique flamenca iconografie from different rubbers.
The illustration that is running in the Month Photos of Flamenca (Mes de la Photography Flamenca), "respectives still the growing international significance of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" can be any people, but when you look at the photo, you will find that there are no typical images of artists on the scene.
These people's portrait "in the street" are artists able to transfer yours, suspects, joy... and completely taking the waves.
The personality of these artists is not needed to be able to acquire.
They're wearing their personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a free atmosphere that allows me to catch the personality of the flamence.
The trial of the festival "Cante de las Minas" started Bauer in 1997 with the portrait of flamenc songs, kitarists and dancing cameras.
It's portraits that by choosing a camera and material in classic photos.
Applying different rubbers is in contrast with the classic foundation of the picture and promotes him the present spirit, which is the idea that Bauer alone looks up and flamenco: "The music with very traditional roots, but doesn't stop surprising and developing."
What the waves strike is not the effect of the sole dance, song or game, but the personality and the character of the artist.
Looking for a moment when we meet the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of imagination, residence and survival was and is the constant work presented during these days in El Fotomat gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists create known flamenca positions, which are other than Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosov√°, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become an anthology of flamenca and will soon be expected of a low release that will contain the builded portraits.
Your portrait has brought Bauer back to the idea to the "Portretchs of sports veteran" ("Sportart Project") two years ago.
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photograph recommends that "foting people, knowing them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or only shorter, to enter into their lives -- that's my honor.
I think there's a portrait of the most difficult gain in the photo.
A man mets or contacts people, persons that sometimes doesn't know, or they'll give him a few minutes to focus.
Despite similar circumstances, I'm trying to perform my imaginations."
The assembly of portraits of the current flamenca named "Flamenco-people" is built in Galeria El Fotomata in the street de la Mata 20, equal to Alameda de H√©rcules, and it is possible to visit it until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the Roman who writes is "trofiality"
It is rejoiced in ¬ßa, which still doesn't know, and reports of events for the unknown, yet Mario Vargas Llosa will successfully perform his new project - just works on the Romanian, whose main hero is Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and traveled in Amazon.
The everlasting favorite of Nobelovy prices for a festival of Hay Festival Segovia, yesterday, admitted that the project that just works it is "is triumph," and that "all convinces that I don't have to write" this Romanian.
"If I had a understanding, I wouldn't do it, but I'm gonna do it and believe that I'll finish it once," he added my contribution to the festival of the change of ideas, thoughts and words that he saw in the town of aquadding about hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the Romanian "City and dogs" was one of the main positions of the third year of the celebration of the word and fulfilled the expectation.
Vargas Llosa, who gained the price of Hay Festival for the most favorite writer - the old issue of Dickens "Our mutual friend" - filled the district Juan Bravo in the last place.
With F√©lix Rome, who introduced him, he had before himself a devoted public whose hour was running as water - Peruanac with a clear accuracy and a note-dose of humor, as it was in it from the "increasing well-belief" of "rejoice of your reader" and from "power to live more than I lived"; as suggests "many of inspiration" by writing "disciplinarly", highly old text, makes and overscribes; or how they influenced his writer Faulner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "all images" are the base of his stories.
The Spanish Romano writer admitted that "is not a way", how to make sure whether and in what way the books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that it is only a funny, a tremendous result" - he highlighted Vargas Llosa with that, according to him, "on humans" and "needs, it is to try to escape from a number," and he called the writer, "do not follow freedom" and "do not be responsibility" his mission.

Llamazares is assigned to the IU Indian association to apply their powers in Silva
The General IU and lawyer of the United Levice Gaspar Llamazares today reported that the final decision in the case of the former Board Committee of Youth and Sports in Seville Francisca Manuela Silvy, who was departed from the office last week after he was accused of negotiating in the benefits of his family, will depend on the national association of the party.

He also highlighted that the page has "strict ethical code for all publics".
"Blue Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), the episode of Garciho
Jos√© Luis Garci in the "Blue Blood" film (Sangre de Mayo), who inspired Episodes from the national past of Benita P√©r ÃÅ Galdosis, survived the glorious resurrection of Spanish against the French - is the most ambitious movie in his filmgraphy with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the film creator wanted to "design the prominence of the position and analysis of the company", which was wondered in the work of the glorious romanop√™s, explained today together with Quim Guti√©rrez and Paula Echevarian during the presentation of the picture before the large team of interpreters.
Blue blood with metres over two and a half hours will be introduced into the cine this Friday and in the future a four-year telemadrid series will be used for more than four-year telemadrid.
As a big literary creator of Galdose Jos√© Luis Garci, he stated that he fulfilled the "children's dream", which thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, which has believed him three years ago in the Autonomous province of Madrid, with the two-year-old Madrid 2 May, he accepted the offer with the exit from Epizod of the national past.
The start of 15 millions, to which the Madrid provincy was completely contributed, meaning to Garci's "only opportunity" to create a rubber with cools and coasts corresponding to the image of "the third Spanish, which was mixed in the leader who had been fighting - the fight for independence led for the government of Ferdinand VII to the accident and residence of the country," he said.
The Regisher, however, claims that he cannot calculate the financial support that has been received to the films Smutne Crystal (Ala triste) or Goyo's miracles - at least twofold Blue Blood - so he could not touch some scenes from the scenario signed by Horacium Valcarcel, with which he works at the whole of his film road.
The recorder of the "Restart" movie (Wolver and empezar) works as it is currently usual - on the scene with the herce, with which it is usually tested before it is running and which doesn't choose by casting, because it seems "needing" and also believes that "a part of the call of the register is to go to the divadel and cine, and so to know what's happening in the area that it is involved".
Many herds who have chosen for the Blood Blood are already found before his camera, such as Miguel Rell√°n, Carlos Larra√±ag or Fernando Guill√©n Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations on Oskar, from which one received, is that no of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the single Blood, the Seven chairs of the French biliar and the last chosen Sleep Solar, represents a young generation of the Spanish film scenes, but says that "they are just open."
For this film, Garci doesn't expect any assessment.
"Now you think you're working for what you're going to be after, but then you'll realize that you're working only for the product, and so you're going to make another movie more," explains Garci with more than 30 years of a repository career.
Isabel Bay√≥n‚Äôs spirit survives the link of the Sevilla Dance Thortoly Valencia
The Sevill dance flamenca gives hold other sevill dance.
Carmen Tortola Valenciaov√°, from the father of Catalan (Florenz Tortola Ferrer) and the mothers of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the fourth Triana, and when it was three years, they moved with the family to London.
She danced the modern dance and focused on the eastern dance.
She experienced life full of warmness, a prominent female emancipation such as Isador Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was buddhist and vegetarian and struggled with the destruction of the curse that disabled women to move freely.
The life of this woman has been taught by the intergovernmental Europe of Isabele Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepou, and she made me this position -- it seemed incredible."
According to the dance, we're not about the story of her life, but about the destruction of the soul.
The names of her dance representations made me flamenca rite.
So "motil dance" evoked my guajir or "hadra tanic" a tanga.
Her dance was sensible and they told me that my ball also answers this estic," he says.
The representation calculates the inclusion of two exceptional characteristics: with Miguela Conduct, which is going to sing Isabele in one exhibition as in the "Open doors" (La Porta opena), and with the factor of the tance Matilde Coral, which made an exception and joined to cooperate with her former jacket.
"Matilde represents the elder of Turtle, a broken position.
I'm happy that she accepted a offer to share my project, and it's a great honour for me."
It also counts with music and cytars of Jesuse Torrese and Ariagy, with the song Miguela Ortegy, el Pulgy and Moi de Mor√≥n; El P√°jara bubny, Rafa El Violy and the Herce Juanfry Ju√°rez, "which has the role of this kind of art, which are premises with all and who are in love with them."
It also takes into account the life of this woman, who played for its time in so far places as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she habitually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think she was of those women who have a major impact at some time, but no one knows her today and then less appreciates her creation," says Bayon.
The presentation begins today at 20:30 in Lope de Vegy division.
The book "Freely Married Day" closes three
The introduction of the first illustrated edition "Day of Cultural Women" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in the place where Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez closed the record with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the coordinated Cultural Council of the Autonomous Dublin Government for the celebration of "Zenobia and Juana Ram√≥na" (2006-2008), ordered to celebrate the fifty-year-year award of Nobelovy the price for the age and expressed their death.
"Trinale Zenobie and Juana Ram√≥n" goes to the end of the new issue of this work, the international congress that will be held in New York, the work of Nobel's Museum House and the way of the exhibition "Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez: On the parsek sun", which was opened in May this year, and then, after a different Andic province, it should be moved to New York according to plans during the congress.
The Cultural Counsel of the Autonomous Andalual Government also negotiated eight hundred prints of the "Dany of the Holy Fear" adjusted by Peter Taberner and illustrated by Jacob P√©rez-Encis, to continue to spread personality and part of one of the most worldwide Daily Banners.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like it so much.
"Always God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of Sally Field's herds who cooperated with him on "No bad intention" and under the timiddom that Newman went away, discovers his unconscious vision of abandoned American cinematography and all America.
Look how long they were before Oskar got.
And that he was income since 2007.
And it felt that he was hardly sick.
Yet, he was for all guys.
"Always what man feels can't eat any way, and I now lost a big friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
Nobody's afraid he's gonna be funny or overcome.
He died the father of the movie and the authorities in particular at the dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, when the American self-consciousness is on the day when they are looking for happiness.
When the time is cruel and people without honesty and only the worst of those who stand for you -- it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda, and they loved Paul Newman.
For everyone, he had almost a platonic idea of beautifulness and truth.
He was an official resistance to Richard Nixon and a fight for lost and winned cases, from the imposation against drug dependence based on the honor of the firstborn son who died for overdose, after his own label of home food and biofuels.
The full expenditure for the country, which has been a lot of efforts to forgive from the self - killing culture.
The Boury Wolf shiped Hollywood without regard to nationality or national responsibilities.
Last James Bond, English Daniel .. found that no man died, but a whole era.
Another English, Oskar's carrier for the Sam Mendes regime, said that working with Newman was without the surface of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Crowe, was trying to mark Newman as his biggest source of inspiration.
"The winter has set us all a nicely high ladder," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the small ones who have courage today to try to live as Paul Newman lives - based on respect and leading a serious privacy life far away from the camera.
It's not easy in the media jungle today, sometimes not even possible.
But happily such people are, and Paul Newman is their pattern.
He was divorced once, and since that time he was married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who was unfair, although he had an insurance more than the enough opportunity to be.
"Why would I go out to the hamburger when I got a filet home?" He shot.
Let him be proud in heaven that he rules a relationship between his daughters and interested ones on the earth - it is not too running in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he has made was the most precious in the role of a faithful husband, a loving father, a voluntary boy and a sacrificed filantrope."
Infinite olympian Madrid divorces
Yes, many of us want olympia to be made in Madrid, and after 2012, it will be possible 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we're going to go to the yesterday bathroom, I'm saying, "No!
It was talking about him as a final battle, and according to my court, it was the worst I was on.
Such an insult that if the evaluation came and I was testing, it would be worth inadequate.
But let's look at it from the beginning, pretty after the second.
Insensitivity begins with the exhibition of a divorce number to which a person must grow before.
It doesn't seem bad to me, but if a man goes there, let them give him everything (which is the chip that is going to go before the overflow of the roads).
But not.
Here a man had to raise the number first (project insensitively, go there only because of it) and (after the present front) - what surprise! - they had only a trick of size S (the second insensitiveness, because I am Size XL).
Where are we living?
They decided to buy only a little truck because it's less substances and they're more leaving?
All right, that's a little bit compared to what happened on the day of the divorce.
Besides that it had to go very quickly for the chip and front over 15 minutes, he had to get a bathroom there.
Over 35 minutes there was a waiting time, which is on a bathroom where 11 000 people expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as it was expected, the bathroom started, and we haven't left the bathroom yet, and when it's been done, it's been much worse.
Moreover, waiting for 40 minutes of rain, leading to general upbuilding and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have tomorrow to deal with some of us like me will not show the right time to evaluate the results of the chip that they gave me and who, as I suppose, did not indicate me the right time of start.
Of course, if someone asks me for a similar perfect commitment, this wouldn't be an idea of me.
So I think we're going to have to let the well prepared olympy town seem to be.
Microsoft searches for reception (virtual)
In the new MIT, Microsoft introduced further development in the new system of recognition of images and human interactions in the way of artificial intellectuality - not too intelligent but able to perform basic accounts such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, the case that would move through the whole area of the company) and what he heard in the conversation.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognises the faces and faces, this "receptive" can make sure how many people are in the room who are - even remember what they have - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It is also able to classify presents according to the conversion groups.
The demonstration video refers to the third person and understands that it does not belong to a group that speaks to it and that it is not a employer of the company.
She's asking if she's going after someone, and she's noticed that she's gonna take her back in a minute.
It's all without the blue screen of death.
Excellent.
But, of course, this is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things on work, for example a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week has been much talking about the change of Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer arrived that if the computers had only the most important, without the cause of commercial insufficiency, they would be five times more executive - man, Steve, they will be more leaving.
Reveal as a hot when we consider that Microsoft version of version adds a new Windows and another "extra".
Amendment of concentration would be a debited action.
Microsoft has the right, the operating system is quickly losing importance and it is likely on that software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who join the theory that it was the first step of Googlu to competition with Windows.
Many have correctly shown that the browser is not a operating system.
The operational system will be needed because it is necessary to comprehend between hardware and software.
He's the same thing as your wife or your husband when you have to say something too.
That's the truth.
It will never disappear, but it's necessary to think of the "death" operational system not as of absolute truth, but of the truth relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are keeping less attention to the operational system and yet more to the Internet browser.
The computer is able to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we take more time every day than around windows.
What is the half of the system running to?
It's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering his online services and finally become an alternative to Googla.
You trust it, and I have a little example here.
I made this photo in one vacation for Microsoft workers in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
On the drinking car was a placate that requested them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used to search on the Google Internet.
Last week confirmed a new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come to the beginning of 2009, but at the end, then let's count until 2010.
In Microsoft, they will certainly try to enter the Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 market together.
The phone becomes more computers.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the latter tree.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso was wearing him at the Azur province, along with the "Cruel Diamond" Edward Zwick, like Al ÃÅino in "Kmotrovi" Francis Ford Coppoly, and also part of the uniforms of the wallet gay communities.
And if we want to go to the calculation of his life roles, we can get down to the image of a typical bowl with a spiderly bridge, which has highlighted the effects in the hair circle.
In fact, there is nothing more than the typical bowl of the lady underground, adjacent and without hands.
The English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels comes over all the finals.
First for his cross-colour name - even though people call him 'Marcel' - which has a relationship with sport, because, as the legend states, it was named by the boxer of Marcela Cerdan, the lovers of the song Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' exhibits the final quality bathroom, unisex with a strike, distinguishing the shitch and (only unknown) a belgic flat, which has models of non-emblematicest tickets as detail at the rock.
And watch, because the Belgian company is not only specialized for tank tops.
He also makes mykins college, retro boxers, cashmire lights, bathroom, marine truck, clothes for children, mini cracks...
Thinking bottles for a comfortable underwear.
Although it's damage to be just the bottom.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, whoever is a father, he doesn't care."
It's not too dangerous to her sister to protect her in the development of her own personality.
Monica's, even the detailed position, is a woman full of life.
Their new action in the mode now takes the sisters very seriously.
For Monique, this means much more than just that some beautiful, famous girls will proclaim their name.
In Paris, the promotion action managed by Mango in its new seat, and the statement of the most significant modern prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's heartfelt and mild, and she's close to you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection that we met with the sister Penelope in Mango at the airport of the sub-hiver, and I also participated in the statement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and the dinner in Oper for the honor of Valentine.
So it was an exciting, but even a surprising day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for whom you're working for?
My sister and I love films from the 50s and the 60s, and we have spent a lot of highlights.
I'm also able to swallow over the town and watch women how they walk, how they combine and level their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a danceman, a hero, a architectural, so a very universal woman, right?
I think yes, but the end of the end is connected and has a lot of association.
Maybe I liked clothes quickly, I still wanted to go to my grandmother, get together in my tea's boxes and watch her clothes.
It was a sense, almost better than going to the wilderness.
Then when I became a dance, I tried to take care of how I was dressed.
But you know that our dancings are based on how we are adjusting, and at our hours and tests, when we look at the sight, they felt well.
And as a bowl, when they give you a bone, then you're going to the station.
So everything is connected, but with great respect to the employees and professionals.
You've been 30 recently, have you got a crisis?
There you go.
I feel better than anyway before, the thirty-five's enjoying me.
I find out the woman's already ready, my experience, and my life's getting out with less mistake.
The biological hours don't scare me.
I'm doing what I want, and that gives me a great internal happiness.
So you're thinking to be a mother, right?
Of course, I know I'm a mother, because my body asks it, and I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
It's about my dad, I don't care about that.
But one thing I'm sure, I'll give my child a feeling of happiness and I'm going to educate him with great love.
It's about the movie, you're waiting for a few film premises that you've cut off.
It's so, and I'm glad when they come into the cinema.
I'm coming out of the divorce world, so I'm very untleavened and quiet, I want everything right now, and, of course, it's not going.
I rejoice at the "Latest hour" and "En search of the tuba de Christ."
Greatly, how they'll like you...
A few days ago, you had your premier on a watch mole on the side of Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not so I'd go to the molo like a model.
Only called me Naomi Campbell, which I already know, and invited me to London to participate in the benefital reviews for her "Woys for Better Life" organization," and the clothes we predicted - I chose two models from our collection for Mango, and the outcome was transferred to this Naomi non-governmental organization.
People don't know that Naomi has a good heart.
It's about her, and I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll keep the good thing he's engaged in.
She asked me to lead me to the goods, but if she asked me to make a stone, I'll do it too.
In the benefit of the third world, I'll do what I need.
The drivers will have to install "alcolock" again with alcohol in blood.
The Ministry requires inside that the driver with three administrative sanctions for the incidence of alcohol have to install a system that prevents him from starting the vehicle in a drinking or if he does not breathe.
It has already been known in June of this year, and now it is already included in the annual report of the High State Representative, according to which it is a pilot project that takes one year.
His goal is to return the driver to the volant, therefore, the drivers will also have to resolve the course of transportation.
In this experience, the National Transport Safety Authority will also participate in the Directorate-General of Transport (DGT) and the Station of the Technology Institute for Car Safety (FITSA).
According to 30 to 75 % of cars accused more than one time for drinking again in this state, they are seated as a volant.
Alcolock should prohibit it because a system connected to the vehicle that measures alcohol cold in the respirated air and prevents the starting of the car if the driver does not breathe before or if it is intended to be higher than the allowed alcohol concentration.
His price is over 1000 euros and he'd have to win her own vineyard.
In this sense in the United States in 2007, it showed that the transition was decreased by 65 % in the vehicles produced by these equipment during the first year following the introduction.
In Spain, it is calculated that 115 people can save life every year.
The care is limited to the administrative sanction of two days: that this behavior may be resolved before it is taken into criminal action.
In order to help its implementation, since the legal adjustment is to be carried out in a strict manner, however, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires amendment to the law.
The equipment has not yet been available on the Spanish market in any sales version, even though some industrial vehicles and public services have already been tested.
Tomorrow the Congres will vote on PSOE (the Spanish Socialist Partie), where this system is recommended to be installed in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, in 17,40 hours, as it was in the programme, the presidential hangar at the Airport of Benita Ju√°rez in Mexico D. F. was the aircraft of Spanish air forces in which the prince and princess of Asturie arrived.
The sun just fell down, but his papers still have been forced to shut up his eyes so that I can see the following couple coming out of the flight.
Under the meetings, the Spanish witchman and other employees stood.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi officers if he knew the Spanish Prince with Princess comes to a state visit.
- Yeah, so it's great, that's going to get to the airport to get people out of here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
However, Mexico pressure knows well who are princess and princess of Asturia and how important their visit is.
A lot of people waiting for a aircraft at a red cow and a military cordone, which creates 27 maritime soldiers prepared to shoot a honest salve.
The prince appears with a smile on the mouths in the clothing of dark blue colors and princess, very hardly dressed and with shaded hair, not having its habitual "peeptoes", obviously reported it that the D.F. is a threatening breast.
Before they go to the room where the official delegation is waiting for, they laugh on photographs, and they're unnecessaryly helping them.
At the doors of the hotel where they will be at home, one of the four largest in the city, a mexican television reporter waits for them.
Best interested mode price
It is probably not the most appropriate place in the world to report a modern price than Paris and it is probably not a most significant payer and bonevivana than Valentino.
Mango just announced the second Yearbook El Bot√≥n-Mango Fashion Awards to enable international presentation to new talents in mode.
The price is covered by 300 000 euros.
Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, watched her ships in Manga's output on the Paris bulvary of Haussmann number 54 and wept at the end.
Of course, it is the second biggest trade in this company in Europe and has just been opened on the area of 1 335 metres of quarter.
The biggest is located in London.
A lot of mistakes with the desire to thank Valentino for the presidency of the concurrence reports have caused us to finally take a breakfast at the Parisian Opera Garnier.
Company Mango, a celebrated president's table, looked at the most significant Chagall works.
Nati, who with the heart of the broken trial for the recent death of her brother, did not show anything, dressed the clothes of this mark and the ELAH scarlets over which the breath was secreted, and locked to his son Luise - a two-meter elegant - made Valentine in the head of the table at the evening for his honor.
Andik, manager and owner of Mango, was welcomed and as a gentleman stayed with the baron Rothschild without sack, because they both offered them to two ladies.
The monkey, which arrived in the trade in - handly proposed - wallets and kitchens, and at evening, dressed into long black clothes, reached a night travel after Oper after Goyi Toledov's delivery, showed us a sal for ballet tests, and at other times, one of the tissues was taken and indicated "grand pipes".
In√©s Sastre didn't keep the palace on the watch after the neighborhood buildings, but she showed us his son at the mobile phone before she left.
The second day we could love the presence of Oliver Mart√≠nese - another young man who drives on the engine - and John Travolty, who came to the Paris Hotel Intercontinental with his own clothes and hands and asked before that they should not be used in his rooms.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001 - Anti-stress Number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and losing everyday life.
And so that it's little, they're all broken in one book that will bring relax to the bookbook on September 30.
The buddy calls every 7 hours as a trial, but it is worse to imagine itself in the successful rythme that brings the present life.
The office is called the pressure and the computer's pain behind.
Stress is the disease of the 21th century.
However, there is no one or two methods to fight every day and to respond to problems from the world‚Äôs work.
No, this number is nothing more and nothing less than 100
Susannah Marriotva, outside the john position, classic mass and "spa" therapy on the pages of his books contained the entire "menu" options modified according to the whisper and time options of each individual.
The Protistres book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookbuilding.
If anybody has that it is impossible to achieve peace in such works or personal relations, "manual" supports this view.
Furthermore, it offers further procedures as to be in contact with nature or 100% of natural recepts that contribute to relaxation.
If you have no adrenaline in the woods, which is reheated in the body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the cup, disable and focus on the cup.
Speaking from sleep
Some kids are talking tonight.
I don't think those who'll wake up and tell us something that happened before, but the kids who speak while they're sleeping.
When this happens first, maybe it will heal you, but it's not significant.
It's an unfair deterioration of a dream that is called a dream.
She's generally frequent, especially in children and youths.
Of course not one of you told you that he was talking about sleep tonight.
This jev can be very proportionate (e.g. one time for life at high horn) or more regular (day, one day a week, one time a few months...), the second day does not remember anything.
There's not only one d¬∑y which would explain her approach.
It is often associated with other slaughters of sleep, such as nightmare, nightmare, nutrition enuresis (natural assistance) or mixture, but it must not be so.
As mentioned earlier, it may often produce very high heat, stress or disturbance.
Anyway, it's a little tested evidence.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak with a quiet voice, speak individual words, sheptate, or just in the contrary (hearing, weeping, long words...).
In cases of great strength, the child should be able to observe and consult the expert to make sure that there is no problem that calls a big weight in it and thus appears.
We said that there is an unfair injury, so it is not only treated if it is associated to the further defect of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it eats with an apnee syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do so that we will remember a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying to get a child too disturbed before he goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somehow violent TV programs or series.
In very nervous kids and those who are allowed to be released, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them get some internal peace.
This kid allows a more quiet sleep.
When a dream comes, try to keep quiet.
Remember that she's unfair for a child and that of what she's doing, the second day she's never remembering anything.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It's inevitable because it's not at home and you'll stop his sleep.
Even if he talks, he's sleeping, and then relaxing.
Remember that if you seem to be very painful some times after you, it would be appropriate to take care of the counsel or to see what the child calls such an ease.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid listening to it and getting out of the information.
It's not going to be anything, because when he's sleeping, he's not going to do it so that he can arrange his thoughts.
Moreover, you hear what he says, but you don't know what he sees about, and then why he says it, so consider how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're doing.
Never tell the kid that you can ask him about his secret tonight.
Not with fun.
It calls a big weight.
Don't do a short care, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found a way to win again after a long hot period.
Unless they were specially appealing to a big burden, the yellows created more chances and made one of them a victory change.
The game hadn't been too hard during this middle, where the attackers were just too difficult.
After the first trial of the host of Kauffmann, who shot from the remote, just on the floor of the band, started to have Illhaeusern easily surrch and first founderflick from the distance, then Hirne air, Romein on the foot or Diebold gradually came to carry the defense of Dannemarie.
In contrast, the soldier placed a defensed valley in the middle of the wall and left only the Agil Riahi on the street of the attack.
The beginning of the second half was shown as a decision, and first by the two chances of Dannemarie named Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening of the skin for Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well-being for the processing of the sword reflected after the previous Diabold trial (53).
However, Goolman Illhaeuser had no joy, for about twelve minutes later, he was needed to return to the shot and thus leave his partners in weakness.
However, Dannemarie couldn't escape and the eleven from Illhaeusern, who just got a little to "smooth" the defense, did not have any more effort, except the last seconds of the storage, when the middle passed very close to March.
Sarcose is to meet the wrathed fishers
Before going to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a railway through the British.
In order to clarify the demonstration of the fishermen's forces that rejected the accessibility of some of the British and Normand representatives on Monday, the French president decided to deal with Guilvinec in Finist√®re to meet their representatives there.
The final names promised that he would accept "in the spirit", and they hope that "they will come with the particulars of us".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the Value of the "Christ Committee" established by the British fishermen to gain measures against an increase in oil prices, which reached the top of the cross-over 1,14 euro per litre.
According to the speaker of the Elysian Palace David Martinon, the President "will talk to them about solutions that can be presented in the effort to help their companies get competitiveness again and better ensure submissions of employment and payment of mariners."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishers with inaccessibility.
In the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, which caused a 10km depth.
The recreation station in Quiberon was also locked, but the connections were not interrupted in the direction of Belle Island.
On the middle of Kiberon, a filter game was carried out.
The mariners have already shown their determination on Monday when they immediately were lightened before the funds of the pools in Brest and Lorient, and they burned pneu and palettes, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau and Saint-Brie.
The movement was extended to other installations at Atlantic and La Manche channels, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vend√©e, where traulery remained in the apartment, or Le Havru, where about twenty ships blocked the operation of trade ships.
Fishers from Turballe and Crossica in Loire-Atlantique during the evening stopped the importance of the total raffinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decide to act at the Central Meeting for the Ministry.
In Guilvineca, however, the "Christ Committee" is to decide how to continue on a deteriorated road and about its responsibility to prepared meetings for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some of the British fishers do not want to be representatives of the Governing Board of Fisheries, which did not support their movement.
"The ship will continue" because "fishers from nothing will not leave" and "not want to get to Paris," she, for example, declared Liliana Cariou, president of the Fishing Committee in Lorient.
However, fishers who do not pay petroleum tax are currently paid about 50 cents per litre, judge that the cost of ship worth is achieved only if the oil is under 0.30 euros per litre.

AIG considers the procedure of 15 % of its activity
The American International Group, of which the US money authorities have received over water, considers that he would make more than 15 % of its activity to pay 85 billion dollars, which were given to him as a refund, writes a Sunday Financial Times issue.
AIG is ready to examine the sales of its activities outside the international field of life and income activity in the United States, explaining the journal that refers to the sources of nearby negotiation.
The AIG Administrative Council, according to the FT, met on Sunday in the evening to examine the eventual procedure.
The AIG could not obtain any confirming declaration.
The assets that AIG wants to be released includes its aeroplane Leasing International Lease Financial Corp., 59% in the guaranteeer of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of freedom and investment in private equity, adds FT.
No final decision on these procedures has been adopted, FT continues.
AIG must be able to be prepared to pay 85 billion money, which the Federal Reserve Bank gave him with the risk that the American authorities enjoy 80% of him, which, at the same time, divides the proportion of the current actor.

Obama wined points in the first television garage
After the first Friday debate between both candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, whose task was to find out who of John McCain and Barack Obama wined.
The major states of the Republican and Democratic campaigns were not surprised when both reported their victories in the television board that followed the third of the American family.
The political analysis David Gergen believes that John McCain, as he was obedient, was not enough "brilanty" to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential elections, and that you've fallen in investigations.
Gallup's establishment, which is the investigation of public changes published on Saturday, encourages Obam's five-country income (49 % against 44 % for McCaina), considers that the democracy is the winner in the middle.
Among the undetermined electors who are rightly concerned, Obama is a winner for 39 % of the questioned, while, according to the CBS, 25 % is encouraged to McCain's winning.
Both should have the opportunity to confirm its leading on Thursday by the proposed good execution of Joseph Biden's colleague, during the first and the only public debate with Sarah Palina's cohesion.
"It would be a mistake to subvalue her.
It's given," he warned about the weekend Bill Clinton.
The seventy-year McCain systematicly highlighted his inevitable experience on the field of the policy, and also highlighted the "naviation" of his cohesion in the issues of the nuclear of the first concentration.
"Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." seemed to have a repeated accusation.
"I don't think the Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to be a president," he also assured.
In such an attractive spirit, they did not come from the yesterday TV meetings.
Both of them highlighted that it represented the future.
He didn't screw his head and showed himself as an expert and accurate.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and to renew the good news of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama yes," he answered the democracy weekend, which states to the Republican that it doesn't have enough in the attack of the crisis on the "current American".
"In the ninety-minute debate that John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people in the Preference Meeting in North Carolina for the rain.
He doesn't even express words as "central class" or "working". The financial distribution is uniquely advantaged to Obam, which Americans consider to be more able to save the economy in the area of loss.
"The next week could be a decision-making break," a democratic senator Charles Schumer considered yesterday.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obam to the "economic prospect" that Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For democracy candidates, the current record of "the final value of the eight-year-old economic policy, how George Bush operated it and how Senator McCain supported it."
The Senator of Illinois again confirmed that, through the unexpected Wall Street shops, he should be able to reduce the tax of 95% of the Americans, and he also warned that the implementation of an eventual energy independence of the country using renewable energy resources is the priority of the number one, together with the implementation of the health security system.
McCain plans to set a park again with 45 nuclear electrics until 2030.
Both candidates were carefully removed from questions relating to the financial aid plan by $700 billion (470 billion), which took the Congress yesterday and was strongly irrespective.
"What are you, have you noticed that the same choices were done in Minsk?"
Young people and repaying the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening at the main place of the white major city to reject the drafts of Parliament's elections.
Several hundreds of Belarus were conceived on Wednesday after closing election rooms at the main place in Minsk to protest against the unregularity of elections to Parliament.
Although no results have been reported yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against the President Luka≈°enka's regime: "dictator, demission".
Some recognize that they didn't say, "What would it be if they would do what they want to do with my voice?"
It does not believe that this regime, which has been maintained in favour of foreign observators to renew the negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to turn to the direction of democracy.
Sanctions, including the prohibition of visions for 40 white-roomed captains and the deterioration of some actives, may be canceled if the options are considered clean.
According to opposition, it wasn't like that.
"We were kept away from electoral Commissions and our observers were not supposed to comply with the votes," Juri Pot√©mkin, speaker of the Democratic forces Union, encouraged the diversity of the twelve parties.
"This is about cosmetic change," stresses Alexander Milinkieviƒç, former opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 and leads the personality of the pro-European movement, "for it is essential to the number of votes, and we have the power to do.
If opposite members are in Parliament, they will be named and never chosen.
However, their entry into Parliament can mean the House in television, meetings in regions and laws."
The opposition must therefore be binding with political functioning because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
If our economy, deeply devoted to Russia, is a crisis and we do not reform, we are threatened to become Russian Protector.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe, who followed the progress of elections, does not declare the elections to be valid.
It highlights that it seems too high and that the general introduction of the preliminary vote (26 % of the electors in Minsk) opened the road with all possible manipulations.
"What are you, have you noticed that the choices have been done?" said the social-democracy leader Alexander Ko'in, one of the two last political principles issued in August this year.
"The electoral rooms weren't even foot.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition commitments in Parliament, those who are most accusing of the regime."
The night's silence was rebuilt in the October.
In television, President Luka≈°enko and members of the Central Electoral Committee are welcomed to success.
Conversation - blood that is safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the tenth anniversary arrest and his president, Dr. Francine Decary, was well pleased because Hema-Quebec became one of the most ineffective and ineffective blood suppliers in the world.
Moreover, he received the confidence of the public, which was seriously disturbed after the scandal with contaminated blood in the 80s and 90s.
As generally known, the state reserve of blood managed by the Transfusion Committee of the Canadian Red Cross has been contaminated by the virus of immune deficiency (HIV) and the hepatitis virus of type C during the 80s.
In the light of this drama and the prominent publicity, the Canadian government started public investigation in January 1994, which the President of the Court of Horace Krever had to explain the circumstances leading to such tragedy, and to formulate recommendations to no longer packaging.
While Judge Krever rejected the report, some provinces introduced the committee to which the new blood management system was planned in Canada.
In Quebec, the G√©line's committee was held in Quebec.
After G√©lineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who had to host Quebec, and the Canadian Kre‚Äôs company for all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Quebec started his activities in 1998, 38 per cent of people were still trusted in the Quebec creation system," says Dr. Decary.
"Situation was increasing.
With a systematic effort to increase the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area during the following years, we have received the confidence of public," he says, and honestly adds that at the beginning of 2008 Hema-Quebek has already trusted 94% of the Quebec population.
However, Dr. Decary doesn't work out the reporter that "the confidence is very cruel."
Since 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec applied the principle of observation.
"When we were in Europe, we were witnesses of a number of cases of human characteristics of crack disease, new disease variants called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," states a woman who leads from her detention in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
Therefore, we have experienced one of the basic recommendations of Krevera and G√©lineau's reports, as we don't know, and when it's a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is indicated to the degenerational brain that leads to death, is necessary to take exceptional measures.
In April 1999, we rejected blood from people who remained in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, there was safe evidence that this blood disease was transferred.
So this episode showed us that keeping the principle of consideration was meaningful."
In 1999, there was a much more precise technique to detect HIV virus: tests using nuclear acid (NAT), which allow to discover directly the presence of the single virus, and never the presence of the antialiases on which tests were used before.
The NAT tests have enabled to reduce the deep periods that occur between the time of the patient and the moment when our blood technicians can be discovered, the specialist explains.
This period we've been able to decrease for less than a week.
We have thus reduced the risk that some donors could be punished, without doing it, and without ¬ß they could come to it.
This improvement enabled a significant reduction of the risk of AIDS gain by cross-transfusion.
The risk of blood of contaminated HIV is now one of the 12 million people.
"With other words, it means that before someone attacks HIV, 12 million blood products should be distributed.
As regards this, Hema-Quebec distributes 400 000 to 500 000 blood products each year, it will be required 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission to blood products.
I have the fact that today we can completely get or prepress blood transfusion needed to cure," states the Hema-Quebek leader.
"The call for the next decades is to keep our products' security.
We never know what a disease-fruit element can be displayed in the system.
The last year, on the island of Reunion, the virus of chikunguny appeared, which is similar to the west Nil virus transfers into blood by smoking.
It must be constantly watchful," Dr. Decary continues and stresses that, besides safe resources, Hema-Quebec must also count with sufficient resources.
"They need to grow because the population is old.
As a result of a more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often have a new dose of red blood or blood decimal.
The population's expansion has also results for the blood donor network, which is consistent only of 3% of the Quebecs authorised for gifts."
Each healthy person age at least 18 years, corresponding to the criteria of permission, but it can give blood only once in 56 days, that means six times a year.
14% of people who offer blood is not in the meantime accepted because they are AIDS or Malaria's carriers, for example, and if they have visited the country in which the bathroom is held, they are expelled for a period of one year.
"The 3% of these we can maintain the status that corresponds to the disease needs.
The missiles are very rare.
However, the members of the network of donors must be supplemented relatively to the earlier and cannot already give blood.
However, to convince people to give blood, it is difficult, and especially to keep and encourage them to become regular gifts.
Life is so unexpected today that we just find a few hours, and we could give blood," Francine Decary's hit.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec adds not only cross products, but also human wheat, such as bone transplants, heart clouds, eye bullets and skin, which are almost extremely used for big burning.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Quebek, which also manages the only public blood bank from puppy powder in Quebec.
The potassium, considered previously biomedicin waste, has a bloody blood on the severe cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"Before a few weeks we celebrated the input of our thousands of blood patterns from puppy shoes to the bank and we assume we'll take them over thousands per year.
At the beginning of the next year, they had to start offering transplantation," declares Dr. Decary, which describes the blood collection program from the puppy snow as a very favorite.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they have no access to him," because Hema-Quebec has no enough cup to offer this complex and sweet program to all the diseases in Quebec.
Fotbal - Impact in semifinale
Impact Montr√©al yesterday at the stadium Saputo during the second, and in addition to a quarter-final feed for the total range, the semi-final round was a semi-final serial of the first USL division, thanks to winning 3:1 (4:3 is a balance by both fees) over Sounders from Seattl.

Quickly - Kovallev's winner .
The attacking three Canadians are ready to start.
The unit complied with Alexe Kovaleva, Tomase Pleance and Andrea Kosticina last night in the Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadian 3:2 on self-invasion.
Costicin, the biggest star of shooting, shot ‚â•, Plekanec shot two assistants, and Kovalev shot one in this fourth victory of six ready stocks.
Kovalev ensured the victory by giving the only one during self-seed findings.
"I'm not still ready," advised Russia.
"I need another shot to feel good."
"In the first third he tried to do this too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
"I think he's evaluated the end of the storage.
He had a nice cup."
Charest is going north
The Prime Minister does not exclude that it will call for temporary options until the end of the year
Soon after the end of the Liberal Party (Parti lib√©ral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (left).
"Remove our last large northern border": this is the ambition that Jean Charest represented last night in a visible way in the conclusion of the Liberal Page of Quebec in Levis, but he did not share details.
During his speech, the images were spread behind him in some image moon.
On the three rounded plates, a switch was running with careful photos of hydroelectrical players, below, Quebek from the "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great Boxes, like in the preferred period.
At the printing ‚â• finally, the Prime Minister refused to claim that he would call the preliminary options on the ground, although he warned that he had a very bought program.
The North Plan is the fourth dimension of the "visual" which the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, see the "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on the work of force, the convention between Canada and Europe and Ontario.
Despite the opening of the North Territory to the 49th equality, the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of the presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has limited the explanation of why the North represents the "great potential" but has not introduced termin, higher investment or a priority in future projects.
Instead, it has changed a number of approaches to points that could be further divorced: in particular water electricity, forests, in particular, but in particular the low sector, the increase in developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
North, after Charest's calculation, it contains "Nil, Zine, Earth, Platin, Gold, Silver, Iron, Titan, and even diamants".
This "ground two times more than France is with us," "he's in Quebec.
And it's not only with us, but it's in us," he highlighted how he wanted to show that it's called a national basement myth.
Quebec was built in a large way in relation to North, highlighted the premier: the golden honey in Abitibi, the Quebec Engineership, James's bathroom.
"It's our, it's our future," added after he was theatrically silent to look at a large map behind his backs.
North, 70% of the Quebec territory, includes the part of Labrador, which Quebec was requested, expressed the premier during the printing.
"It's a traditional position that repeated all relevant governments.
There is a rubber line which no longer exists in the contract, and if the appropriate opportunity is to be, in the name of the Government, this position will be re-employed," he said.
Otherwise, "is in relation to climate changes, too, to think again of our vision of North," he stated when he spoke about the transition of northwest, which will be opened throughout the year, in the result of the renal testing.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that to take the territory is committed.
And what about the people of the territory, the people of the nations and the Inuit√©?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful for them and that their project would be successful, especially for young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L√©tourneau (ex-pequistic lawyer from Hungary), have already started negotiation with some 30 communities.
The interministerial committee, president of Benoit Pelletier, started with the important position of Julie Boulet (Reference and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister doesn't exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily summit", but a moment when "the common vision will be drawn out."
The development of the North should finally be implemented in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "commonly proposed, structured and careful to life ‚Üí," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visual" as a gasoul on the vision of Liberal Prime Ministers who preached him.
"We have changed our thoughts as liberals, and the challenges have changed in a new opportunity for growth and development."
These were, finally, one of the still translated weekly subjects, which was started on Friday by a big cocktail that highlighted the 50th year of Jeana Lesage to the head of the side.
One of the accepted resolutions aims to baptism Beauharnois' center on Adelard-Godbout's overburn.
"From Godbout, which founded Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who performed the Clid Revolution and the Nation of Water Electricity, until after Bourass, who created James's campaign, our side was able to create the future," said Jean Charest.
At the printing √Çi he called to another authority, this time conservate, and although the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbakera, the premium in 1957 to 1963.
When a row came to Eastmain1a-Ruper's overground hydroelectrine, Charest highlighted that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I'm going to be at it," he believed his members basically, which he's called a significant whisper.
The same Prime Minister, which in April said that in 2008 the elections would be taken, and, of course, not in 2009, did not allow elections on the basis of the annual year, which allowed him to be allowed by the Law.
However, he highlighted that his programme is purchased, especially the mission of the Federal Council in China and the summit of Quebec-New York.
The weekend sheet provided the leader of the liberal platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "snotes to change the establishment", which have been very cold: PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebek) requires particular recognition of "Quebec specificity" in the Statute.
It also wishes that Quebec nominate a part of the Canadian Council members for voting and television transmissions which should have the right of veta in case of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the North Plan was to accept skeptics in his main drawings.
Boss PQ (Parti Quebecois) Pauline Marois repeated the development of North Quebec, which the Landry Government sent down in 2001.
According to her, when the Government of Liberals reached power in 2003, the implementation of this policy was stated.
If she had kept her "before today," Marois noted her candidate in Jean-Talon (which elections are currently running) Fran√ßoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the Government.
"Now, we accept that it is not just a distraction," explained Sebastien Proulx, leader of Mary Dumont, who is going back from empty day today.
Letters - Country of Countries
It was Vic Toews, the "justice" ex-minister (o ironie) in Harper's cabinet, who allowed it to say about Louise Arbour to represent the "hanbu" for Canada in the past year.
Thus, a woman who has led an inevitative fight for justice and who deserves all our wonders, tells many about the primary environment and Stephen Harper's alone.
We have a government before us, which, as one of all western countries involved, has not brought back to the authority of his State member closed in the concentration camp of Guant√°namo.
The government that doesn't bear in a catastrophe that at the time they had to play the acts that were performed to him, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, although Canada signed the female convention, stops his word and leaves her wound in the Neilida soldiers' neighborhoods.
The only one who is in charge of the parodium of justice to judge the wine of the accused.
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and, in particular, the Canadian Advocates' Association, takes the Repatry of Omara Khadra in order to wait for a just process in Canada.
The government then closes the eyes before the torture: Its little concerns that this young man is first psychologically devastated, and it was unfortunately sustained, after so many years of trial.
We don't realize that, but we're just witnesses of the prominent erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the words that Harper has so much to be stuck and which from his mouth sounds so empty.
It came to pass when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to get wrong with him, to catch it according to the book of the Boss after that of the Minor Government (as it will be after October 14...).
Many electors will find a salvation on the side of the Ctnost, Law and Rhode: they don't see that this government has been told about what has created our country's reputation and seriousness.
Hanba's, Mr. Tuwsi, it's going to talk, not anywhere else.
Suggestions - Orwellov discourse company Barrick Gold
In the issue of September 17, Le Devoir printed the letter of Patrick J. Garver, the Executive Vice-President of Barrick Gold.
With orwellow logic, it confirms that the largest gold manufacturer in the world has started a trigger of three authors and a poor small packing for the honour to call "transparent public debat" and requires six millions of them.
If the judges are independent and independent, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of deceiving for honor, but the law.
It's not surprising that Garver will completely dismiss this principle.
Or is it the best way for Barric Gold to conduct public debates, to bring anybody to the middle, who would be depressed to take a different position?
Whatever the process occurs, the authors and issuers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be required to lose respectful amounts to be prepared to go up and fight in a very unbalanced fight against the military of the lawyers supported almost without the capsules of the counterparty.
Tactics in these unbalanced threats are finally often in the destruction of the complaints in order to execute a disturbable procedure that presses the mouth on the opposite side and also fears anyone who would distort this matter.
If the company Barrick Gold wanted a public debate, she had its view of the whole thing to represent the public opinion.
In contrast with what's happening in some countries where Barrick Gold acts, in Canada, the debates in normal circumstances in exchange of thoughts, and never in the wounds of the wounds.
Therefore, the remote company disappeared before opening their books, documentation and dealing with the discussion of news, media, publications and financing of independent teams that could bring light into all things.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public mention and rejects the petition and letters to support the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could require "public debates" and, at the same time, the views of the public would be repeated?
This word in the Vice-President World seems to be marked only too payable lawyers, not to all the Canadians; it is a pretty fair understanding of this concept.
In the democracy, he has the right to handle the natives.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and issuers of Noir Canada does so, especially because he refuses the brutal ways of the rental company.
The public is ready to hear and judge, but on the basis of civilized changes of arguments, not in the context of what many people consider as a trigger, where the claimed mouth (in its dealing with "public debates", Barrick just gave the official call to the authors of Noir Canada to inform them officially that they should stop using this term...).
If we distort the surreal Garver's manifestation, the initiating Barrick Gold is a direct attack on universal freedom of request and seeking the truth, which are fundamental for each democracy society.
It generally supports the right to citate confidential resources and to discuss the facts and interpretations that represent the basis of intellectual activities.
If there will be a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects that do not like the rich companies of this world, without repeated shame, who else will be able to do that?
If Barrick Gold wanted a public and transparent debate, she could create it if she was able to handle the deep standards used by Noir Canada authors.
He has the right to answer.
The universities to which we are, are already able to conduct debates and accidents and to resolve conflicts.
The translated complaint of Barrick Gold shows that, despite what it states, it does not have any more satisfaction to conduct a transparent debate.
For the University World, it is a loss, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would restrict such injustice.
Security operations of Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Business administrative and translators of the Congress, as well as the Republic and the Democracy, finally yesterday have reached agreement on the greatest safe economic plan from the great crisis of the thirty-years.
The new version of the plan, as a means of 700 billion dollars to reduce the financial crisis that has been cloumed by Wall Street for months, has to be approved by both Congress cells.
In particular, it suggests: better control of the chosen representatives on its ability, new mechanisms to ensure payment of public money stored, new measures to capture the amounts of houses enjoyed for non-payment and also the right to follow the heights of the employees payed by fire-friends.
The American Ministry of Finance Henry Paulson, President of Snemovny representatives of Nancy Pelosi and representative of the republicans at the acting table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news last night a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and have grown up to the agreement that will be able on the market," said the representative of Bush's administration, Henry Paulson.
"All was done so that real economy and remote Americans were safe before the crisis just running on Wall Street," he explained the democracy.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the destruction of the Americans' lives will be great," said the republic Judd Gregg.
During the last hours, the negotiation was extended to maximum turnovers from fear of the effect, which would have further failure to distribute investors.
The time limit was the opening of markets today.
Both candidates to the American President were invited to negotiate the call and both were more for the agreement, but they did not remember to make their incompatible with the need for such a national solution.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has approved the completion of the agreement on some measures, in particular the aim of ensuring the holders to maintain residence, and measures on the road leading by the worksstats saved by fire.
"When we ask payers to take special measures for the independence of some people, it isn't what to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television wheels.
His Republican cohesion John McCain, who was questioned by another state of whether he would vote for the plan in question, answered, "I wish to see details, but I hope yes."
"The crop drawings I've read [shows] are about something that we'll all have to do and help to continue.
The choice of inactivity is quickly unacceptable," he said.
The objective of the 700 billion plan is to buy for the money of payers a doubtful inquiry and risk and unselling activity of the American financial institutions.
The plan is coming after 14 months of crisis spread by bubbles on the market incapacity, which leaded first to the risk hypothetic credits (subprimes), then transferred to further, expanded forms of credit (PCAAA) and contributed to the reimbursement and to the distribution of banks and financial institutions.
The first time of the agreement from the last week of May to the meetings of the Republican Members.
Since the democratics have reached that for some "toxic" activity of the company who has powers, the government will only be handed, but they will not be discovered, it is the conviction that the unusual commitment is blessed.
In order to draw close to the anti-economic opinions in the Congress, measures were attached to establish that the Government would be able to carry out new taxes that would help them to recover their contribution if the programme would have to collect losses for five years.
The new plan will calculate the summary of the first amount of 250 billion, which will be able to add another 100 billion, if the President considers necessary.
The additional 350 billion should be approved by the Congress in a new vote.
As a result of his help, Washington will receive shares in protected companies that will pay dividends in the case of his profits and who will be able to sell again when it will be after all.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to deal with the procedures of parliamentary facilities associated with the loans to which the plan is concerned, as to determine limits for the highest evaluation and damage paid to the leaders of fire.
The guards of the plan would also vote in the Snow Representatives today and in the Senate in the center.
Despite all the effort imposed, it is not yet sure that their plan will have green.
Yesterday, the votes in the Republic and in the Democratic camp have continued to be reported against this project.
"It is obvious that Washington doesn't hear you," reported on the address of the voters of the Republic of Scott Garrett, member of the financial committee of S√∂mmny.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there's a solution.
However, it is not a solution to payment."
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the modernizer of the group of congressmen of the "sceptic committee", presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economy teachers, including three Nobel prices, wrote to us: we ask Congress to not be too quick and carefully examine the way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe again confirmed that this crisis is a world crisis.
After the end of the extraordinary meeting, three countries reported to Benelux the part of the Bank of Fortis group by 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion USDs).
The Intervention of the Government, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paris bank notified that it declined from the purchasing of its competitors that continued to distort since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion USD) in the light of the crisis of the risk credits to buy inability in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, which belongs to the twenty largest European banks and between ten largest insurers.
"We won't come about these money," said the Netherlands Ministry of Finance Wo's yesterday.
"We get the electoral right to the payment and effect.
And this is just what the observers and households can be able to evaluate today's uncertainty."
On the other hand, La Manche channel seems to be started by the British Government of the nationality of another banks achieved by financial crisis.
According to the English pressure, the government had to overcome all existing credits of Bradford and Bringley banks, from which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion USD) were made credits for the purchasing of freedom.
According to his yesterday announcement, the Spanish Bank of Santander will buy the customers and accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be a second bank after Northern Rock, which the British Government has to be given since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Communityly engaged icons
His beautifulness with azur eyes represented his tromp, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American hero lose the smiling smile of narcissism?
Yes, and not.
Inflammation, emotionality, and unexpected talent that was his own, also removed from the strong category that produces true stars.
But what a fucking run on the trait!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years on his ranch in Connecticut, in the light of the cancer of the flash and remains one of the last American cinematographic icons in the last years of busy.
Less big than Brando, who was like and who was his rival on the film plate, Newman was a more careful herd, a strong crowd, but also the apostle of freedom and divorce of dramatic conventions.
The bleeding blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of Hungary.
From these European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream was born.
Without a surprised egg, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it the whole country was seen in love for himself made man, a battle in war in a hurtful battle, who at the beginning of 50 years studied heritage in Yale, then visited the Newyor Actor's actor and celebrated triumf in the divadle, in television, and entertainment in the film.
The same man, who fighted for citizens' rights, was also a car leader who was located as a second at the 24-hour trip in Le Mans in 1979, and in contrast with sexual symbol, even since 1958, made a model couple with Joanne Woodward's heric.
With him, it also declines the nice places of this, discrete, commonly engaged stars, allergic to the link of their own show-business, which will always remain in a certain degree of mysteries.
Hearing man, in the most surprised words of meaning.
The department of Paul Newman this week has caused a return to the lovers of the film, while his great role together contributes to the black plague.
After him, more than a half of the centuries, he continues to change the seventh American art.
In the memory, a charming bow from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his meaningful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cotce to the spread border, the adaptation of Tennessee Williams of 1958.
From less ancient past (1990) we make up his sensitive Mr Bri¬∑ disappointed in a progressive marriage, which did not complete all expectations.
So many other Pauls Newman's entered into the ‚Üíin.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, thrown, violent, unforgettable delicten from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In a sign of hatred) Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, taken after his death, which Newman introduced in a real knowledge in 1956.
Sympatical gangster in the perfectly beautiful The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
The Houstler Robert Rossen (1961), the same position in the Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him in 1987 of the only Oscar with the seven nominations.
This face of traveling, it was he.
And he again.
His professional road together supports different periods.
Young people know her primarily thanks to Slap Shot George Roye Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-radical hokey trainer.
The fans met him again in 1994 in the Hudsucker Proxy brothers of Coen.
Then his career closed the role of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendese in 2003.
In the section of some film legends, which were quickly left the movie, Newman remained in gigi, perhaps Hollywood was sentenced with his bills, shows, and procedures.
The French filmer Bertrand Tavernier, never without humor, considered it "for a living challenge of subplaying", judged that in his exercises he pressed too much on a drink.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose role were joined as on the weights, it wasn't a professy so near.
However, the lovers played less often than outsides: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps, and disfellowships, whose fall and rebellion were reflected in his perfect drawings.
As register Newman, he discovered a few known pages of his sensitive feelings.
His movie Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (with the Romanian Canadian Margaret Laurences), in which the main role of his wife Joanne Woodward, gives a sensitive woman's portrait full of melancholia.
His son Scott, who was lost for overdose, was filmed in 1984 in Harry and Son, full of study and distress.
In the additive of the poet that was given to Newman yesterday, his big friend and former companion Robert Redford (she played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) he warmly declared, "His presence made my life and this country better."
Majesty, love for life, such are the main characteristics of the dead heart.
If we move his legendary career, there is also a big fight for citizens' rights, ecology, independent movie, Hollywood attack resistance.
His illustration was usually used to see on the rocks of the wine eye, the kidneys, the sugars, and other foods, which could have appeared to be quite unexpected, although it was at first about the gag.
However, the benefits of the sales have gone to the account of his Nadation for Hard Childrenship.
Newman's so, rather than he'd let his glory go, he's been involved in the company until the last time.
His five daughters left a letter containing the characteristics: "Always and until the end your father was thankful to his happy planet.
I was honest that I could be here."
And for us, it was an honor to watch the life road of a so clear and great American artist.
Besides, the end of the end, the model citizen.
What was done in fact on the factures of Zuschlag & sex?
Later, October 8, it will complete the compliance in the criminal proceedings led against Janosi Zuschlag and his partners.
‚Ä¢ and its partners are other criminal acts, including the depth of the paper, accused of the subcutaneous period and the systematic criminal organization, in which the result was extremely significant damage.
According to the procurement, money obtained in public concurrence to their own employees and to carry out tasks were often made by fitting factures.
Finance from State and self-submission - about 65 million forints - were partly traveled to the Fiatal Baloldal post-party organization, partly to the capes of individuals.
The way that the investigation authority also informed was that the money obtained in public concurrence was chosen on the basis of the fact that it was not anti-evaluated and that the collection commitments had never been achieved.
According to the consequences, a large part of the facture was false.
The prints to these factures were entered from the Yosseffuros market, the cool ratio was made in Kisconhalasi.
On the name of which fire has the production of factures to be carried out, it was decided on the surrounding road after the northern Balatone sea, which was sent to Itv√°n Ladose Yanos Zuschlag.
According to his responsibilities, he was first appointed to look at pen and restaurant.
In them he requested for its consumption, according to which the factures submitted in the public concurrences expressed outside the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs, respectively the Court of Master City.
Our information most often wrote reports necessary to obtain the subvention.
On his "Studial Travel", Lados saw a bird.
According to the two facts issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, this hosting facility for a ninety-year-old group from Biztos Pont was guaranteed.
But so many people would not immediately go into this equipment, according to the statement of the leading company.
Similarly, the facture was made by formal and content errors made in 2002 by the name Jobb J√∂v¬©√©rt, the Egy√ºtt and Harmadik Evezredt.
The Pen in Badacsonatomi had only three rooms, more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one evening, but the fact was mentioned for hundred thirty guests.
However, the printers with the rich fantasy also transferred it when they introduced the documents of the same hosting company - Pigal s.n.o., in which the information provided by the State Representative of the Republic of Jobb J√∂v√©rt and Hopp√° did not even figure the documents on the name of Jobb J√∂v√©rt and Hopp√°.
The leadership of Gy ¬∑z ¬∑ Farkas for hvg.hu indicated that when they called him to the procurement and showed him the factures, he immediately stated that it was about false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax numbers were in the wrong place."
As added, other than the formality did not agree that, according to factures, hundreds of people have only 11 rooms that have no so great capacity.
Moreover, on the fact, there was also a feeding, while their restaurant does not work for a long time.
The horrible producers of factur did not even declare that the projected Budapest road‚Äôs office was organized only for the roadway, and in the facture of payment in preparation, which was also not agreed with the factural practice of the company, they introduced posts as a service for the deployment of the road to Hungary.
Furthermore, as the investigation has occurred, they also introduced the DPH document, whereas the organization of travel to the country outside the European Union was simplified by the DPH.
In the four documents published by Jobb J√∂v¬©√©rt company Hotel Rev√ºl√∂p s. r. o., it did not agree beyond other or above DPH. The company did not include 25 percent, but 15 per cent of DPH, but the employees made the hotel only printed factures, but the facture was written with the hand.
Yet, the "separators" have noticed the facture by indicating in one company how the investigation of the State representative was shown as the operation of the road transport of goods which the company based on investment advice did not perform.
The factures issued by Egy√ºtt and Harmadik Evezredt and the generations XXI. Shazadi Culturalis Egyes√ºlet and Biztos Pont were false, but it was also caused by formal declines - the incompatible format of facture and injustice.
Similarly, as in the case of Ravenna, or the Sport camp in Kunfeherto, whose representatives claimed that they would make the factures.
For example, the applicants did not not notice that HIB was from Nyiregyhaza at the time (2001), when a group of Fiatal V√°rosert groups was born in liquidation, therefore, according to our information, the liquidation Commissioner of the company also claimed that it would give a paper.
The building of the houses
The second group of factures is those who believed that they had a fitting facture.
Es√©ly Budapestert has made four million forints for the Harmadik Evezedert for request for the Fiatal Baloldal organization - Efj√∫ Szocialistak.
The leader company Collab s. o. adopted, in accordance with the complaint to issue a fiktivity of one of the accused Ludovic Gy√∂rfi.
With Zuschlagm and its partners, Biogate s.r. o, currently in the liquidation, which in 2003 resorted to Jobb J√∂v√©rt and the associations of Atlas and Pre√∂sfeny, with factures in the value of five million forints who have not been involved in economic activities.
Not a movement of money, because the factures created were recently charged, which, however, have forgotten to introduce in their documents.
The other group of facturing fires belongs to those who had commitments to blame.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was a convinced representative of the Ucrainian acting company Delta Tri√≥ s.o., which was involved in trafficking with fresh weights and motor vehicles, with a seat in Budapest, where however, the company is not to find.
In October, November 2005, the company issued a few factures for the sale of clusters in the value of approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, the Cash Investment company purchased these factures from 14 September 2005 in the liquidation.
The unit of this company was a man from Romania who had to submit letters to the company as well as Ivan Kubatov in the years 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that, by the name of the company, he granted the factures to the members of Atlas, Hopp√° and the opinion of Egypt and Harmadik Evezredt and accepted their anti-evaluation.
On request of Iv√°n Kubatov, Romanian walls were found by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. o. e. and Jos-Investment k. s.
However, none of the fires worked, according to the excuses, because they missed work.
Nevertheless, businesses were benefited from him, because at the request of the associated lawyer Zsolta Szente, who also prepared their booking lists, made by fire the factures to Atlas and Y-generation on Zuschlag.
The name of the Firem Investment, Delta Tri√≥, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubat's organizations a total of 15 factors in 14,2 million forints.
The State Representative claimed that Kubatov had reached 10 per cent of the amounts listed on factures and DPH.
To build fiktiv factures, this time for the choice procedure for the Biztos Pont, the man also used the Szi-Beri company at.t.
In January 2006, the groups of Y-generation and ≈†√∂vets√©g and Modern Magyarorzhagert were assigned to the public concurrence of Mihalye Thasics (TMA), publicly successful socialist parties' organisation.
They were obtained after 500 thousand forums, but the amounts did not be charged for the purposes set out in the proposals.
In order to not find out, the TMA presented five fiktival factures from the Works Team s.o.
These factures were finally found at the house of the guardian in the Office of Ar'd Kemecsei at the Ministry of School.
During the calculation of parts of the accused ones, it probably described the progress of the production of factures how it had already affected the procurement.
It can be more interesting if everything is decided to discover the main accused Janos Zuschlag.
His successful explanation is not too detailed, and he has already promised that everything would exhibit, but he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it is in his interest - a exchange for a large part of damage, fifty million forints, perhaps socialists have concluded the agreement with him and Zusi will take it to himself.
This could eventually be deceived because his request for the decline of the submination of his detention, which is the place in the household, remained unexpected.
While economic offences who have committed much more damage that they have not yet replaced, they can be freely prosecuted or at least wait for the end of the management against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology: Why do we lose more money?
In loves, the clients are willing to lose more money, to estimate goods.
Neurological and economic bases of this known - and probably irrational - have been able to discover researchers from the neurology and the Economy of the New York University.
According to their studies, published in Science magazine, people do not want to stay in competition with the type of eBay, so they will pay too high price.
The investigation with experimentally tried to map the scheme of this "play" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers, the second group has reached food, using the method of magnetic rezonance (fMRI) tested by the active brain of tested persons.
In both games, the players could win money, but at the game on a game, whose important element is to overcome the other side, began to work intensely when playing the whole insane under the brain, called striatum.
This brain is playing, besides many other roles in the "self-promoting" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, the increase of the price may be explained according to the researchers who are trying to avoid any reaction of the striat.
In order to support their theory, the members of the research team conducted a financial cross-border investigation.
There were three groups in charge of different submissions against one partner.
The control group was simply reported the real value of the product concerned, and they affected the profits.
Further members of the other group were also promised that if they go out of the game winning, they would receive more $15.
The third group had 15 dollars before the debt, but in the case of the expense, her members and those money came.
Thus, the division between both groups counted everywhere in that one was highlighted by the winning and the second loss.
However, members of the group playing "contrees" were willing to go higher than it was in a control and "victory" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neuronologists.
"This results cannot be produced from any previous economic theory.
These have yet explained evidence notable for the joy of winning and avoiding risks.
Until the neurological educational methods helped us to resolve the opposite between these two theories so that we have grown up to the third explanation," Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of New York University.
Hepatitis: When to search for your doctor?
Approximately half billion people around the world suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic jater disease is indicated between the main causes of death.
The start of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to hundred thousands, but only seven thousand of them are treated.
The name of the hepatitis is a comprehensive name of hepatitis infectional damage caused by different viruses.
In their symptoms, there are many similarities, it is significant to treat the jater and the throat, but the pain of disease and the caused disease is different from each other.
The hepatitis virus is width in two main ways: hepatitis type A and E with treating equipment (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood viruses and body fluids (sperma, posts, secrets).
Travellers should, in any case, be protected by expectation against virus A and B, against the type C virus.
Hepatitis A signs are shown two to three weeks after the use of the pharmacokinetic food, generally injuries, weaknesses, breast-feeding, destruction needs.
Then on the skin and the eye white will be created a flash, a luminous chair, and a dark power. The treatment can take two to three weeks.
Each year, millions of people will die worldwide for the more serious type of this disease, for the cancer of jater and hepatitis B.
The reason is that, according to the estimates, only every tenth of the medication-addicted medication is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious effects: if it is not treated, it can lead to a hepatitis or jater cancer.
The majority of those inquired of their disease doesn't know, the powder of the disease is totally destroyed by the heat cells, so the first symptoms will be given in many cases until 20-30 years.
That is why it is very important for temporary prevention, conducting a regular description.
In three groups, this disease is much more frequent than in the meantime: among people who have produced blood transfusions before 1991, between drugs and tattoo people.
Currently, the world-wide global group of individuals who are infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million.
Since a disease may prove a already-rutinal survey, a person should be returned to his practical doctor if he refers to any symptom of an unknown person.
When discovered, the disease is medical, the virus can be removed from the body, and protected so nausea and prejudice to the survival of cancer.
30 September, the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized by the organizations representing the diseases of the world in 2004.
His goal is to be warned of the chronic jater heat caused by these viruses, the causes of his exhibition and the importance of the timely recognition of the disease.
Who's going to do God, is it so hurt?
According to recent research results, faith in God works as an analgetic that could facilitate death to Catholic muscles.
Scientists from the Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examined how the human faith affects the God of impression of pain, reported the British Journal Telegraph.
At the time of a bizarre survey, 12 Catholic clergyers and the same number of ateists were held with electric shocks, while all observed a malba showing Mr. Maria.
According to the results, the Catholic clergy ability was to discover a large part of pain.
The technology also showed that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
The investigation is the first of the series of requests which are academics, philosophers and theologists from different parts of university.
The test was completely performed so that the test was attached to the left hand of the test entity to the ignition tool that issued electric shocks.
Students asked the tentatives to watch two males sincerely: Sassoferrat Mrs. Marii, who entered from the 17th century and Dama with food da Vinci, named in the 15th century.
Research authors hoped that the view of Mrs. Marii would call on a certain status of divinity, while they chose Vinci's image because they were too different from the first time and acted according to them with a quiet income.
Electrical entities traveled half hours in the MRI scanner and during this period received in four of the following parts of 20 electric shots, while separately followed the image with religious or generally.
The Catholics realized that when they looked at Mrs. Marie, they felt "in safe" as if they were "build" and "speaked, he filled them with peace."
When they saw the image with the religion, they felt about 12 percent less pain than they had a work before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in research, believes that a similar can be achieved by means of any strongly effective image and with the athleists, only a proper photo.
"They have to find a picture that will be very positive, from the position of their mother or father," said psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"The practice of faith should be changed and in many cases will also change our personality," added Wright.
After such excellent results, there is only a question of what kind of pains should be regulated if they show them some madone from a comparable calibration or a minority of similar calibration.
Would he mean a view of the quality Mrs. Marie to reach even better results?
You're what you're going to share.
Of their tenth births, Google can announce that people can fix it in their capsules at least as well as in heaven above the head; they know where they were allowed to do what professional investigation is going on and what they're interesting.
According to Erica Schmidt, one of the boss of the company, it's still lost.
Of course, regarding skeptics, making a paralel with orwellow dark vision, these are not just a self-based basis for the 2.0 web.
Eric Schmidt has recently stated to the Financial Times journal that the main googlu is to deal with more personal data, which is needed to be able to keep the Goog funders with their p-project, which said: "Let us arrange all information in the world!"
According to the corresponding representative of Googlu, the company also stands after ten years of worldwide work just at the beginning to work with all information.
The question, which will be in five years, Schmidt answered that if Google could answer the question "What's going to do tomorrow?" or "What work would really be going to do for me?" - on such a simple question, however, software will be able to answer until the time they'll get enough information about the recipients.
Not all website members believe that during the Internet search, the search words are accurately encountered and the IP addresses were searched and on which pages the interesters were moved after search.
Thanks to the Service Personalized Search started two years ago, for example, they can keep their surfing history, they can look back to what they searched and on what they clicked, then in the perspective generating findings that are adjusted much more directly to them - in the same logic, the Recommendations service will also be recorded, and the system will be based on the previous and saved preferences to offer products and services.
What if my data will be used against me, and if anyone looks at me, what am I interested? - those who look at the Googlu data monopol fear.
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company is increasingly increasingly affected, and the reaction does not call on the Internet's owners of the fault, the fear of distortion, the desire of freedom or even the rebellion against power.
In fact, it is confirmed that not only all such expressions are assumed, but, in the cases concerned, may also be issued by the third party, in such legal cases, the personal rights of the Internet can not be kept.
The most famous example of the last time was sometimes coordinated against Brazilian pedofils, during which the Google Brazilian Government provided information that enabled the identification of pedofils from the community sides of Orkut, created by its ability.
However, Internet facilities who care for personal rights could still breathe in May when the company with EFF's electronic rights organisation has successfully demonstrated their truth in connection with the FBI: Google should not be in the future any article of the institution needed to provide any information for the secretly requested FBI.
(In the same time, the Federal Government has succeeded for fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of searched expressions, which have been obtained with a refusal to strengthen the child protection law before the year adopted, however, it has not been able to obtain lists of searched items of individual persons, respectively complete lists of web pages and key words that include two months.)
Google's view is so prominent: it's aware of those who are afraid of providing their personal data because they feel that their intimate sfer and private life will be by starting using Googlu services, which have been built up in mind, and stand against it with a revolt that belongs to the supernational companies with conservation image.
And then, the American geek of culture and its big leg, gathering around herself overwhelmed computer fans, activists and actors, which appear in many countries, in it sees a new generation of greatkofire, "corporation, which now strikes", in the range of his Microsoft rival, considered by Windows as the people of the world, as they both fight for the same purposes.
This can be caused by Google to deal with Microsoft does not require the identification code from its holders and does not want money for its own; open, free and continually clean source of information and software packages act as much more available, younger, "cooler" than the practice of the official software work.
However, it can also be caused by the geeks to understand a very difficult relationship with the Internet and personal rights that have brought with them just one of the most discreet key words of the last years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we are mentally left tracks behind us and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their range is in each other, the foundation remains the same: we show us.
A medium-sized young man can lead a profile immediately on some community pages from Facebook after Xang, which can be quietly connected to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, which refers to the listening music, then all of it can connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides it can write a blog on which it will automatically discover his newest photo gallery that is located on Flickru or Picase.
In addition, we can learn about many examples from which it explains: Friendly, when looking at the photographs of joint friends, it will easily come to who her deep friend was born tonight, or the company can exhaust his worker only because it is in his blog that he has a sincere opinion on the top direction: one is sure, the meal of the private life has been completely overcome today.
Whoever lives online life is consistent of what he shows from himself, so they could define the basic tess that hides after the behavior of today‚Äôs youth.
And whoever wants to get something out or at least avoid google monopol, has the possibility (begins Scrooglam, which uses the Googlu search system, but does not intended to keep tracks).
For example, a few people are not authorised to register on community pages so that they are not possible. Online Google from the text editor after photo editor and the reporting portal is possible to change in alternative versions that are not connected to the open server parks and which will not be set up the most qualified profile.
Public change is not too secretly expected when Google will show the tears.
The company has its current value of 156 billion dollars higher price than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense insertives threaten the investment of advertising agencies and services which continue to be carried out with the temptation seriously disappointing life not only to Microsoft but also to other software designers.
The critical observers, however, also dismiss the contra points of disturbance by the deficiencies: for example, the top leader has completely refused the protests of employees after a double range of payments for fire schools, which were freely often the daily feeding of employees according to the management of the company, all of the losses at the fact that Google still was before the Chinese Government in 2006 and, in the meaning of their agreements, exhibits every finding that causes good trial, respectively to the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company seems that it never indicates a new service before, just when it is already possible to be used, but it is certainly that expectable problems in the following months and years can prevent the world in new places: while some believe that Googlu project related to scanning and recording books and magazines has such dimensions that the company will soon have regard to the US Highest Court, other fears of its health system, in which we can create a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
Google builds a genetic database, then it can serve as a good standard material and for the next generation of ci-fi writers, the glorious news of Cory's Doctor "Scroogled" describes the future with orwellow records, in which it can be fully closed to humans only using Googlas data.
Double-personal killers from Ozdo helped to remove two young people's tracks
Two youths listened to the police in the case of double murder in Ozda, according to a doubt, helped to remove the stop of this criminal act, he said in the protester of the High Police Directorship of Bursod.
Persons to activities from which they were underscoreed, have been found and are currently accused of helping a criminal act.
Both youths, according to the MTI information of two girls, are thrown into freedom.
Assistance to a criminal act shall be penalted by taking freedom for up to five years.
Suspected of a double murder in Osda, a 23-year-old man, was on Sunday to take a temporary commitment.
It is undervised by a criminal act before planned some canabisable murders from deficiencies.
During the investigation, a 23 - year - old young man deserved 53 - year - old man‚Äôs amount.
The suspect didn't want to pay his debt, so his fellow believer was cut off the past center to one operation in Ozda, where he killed the first man and then his 9 - year - old daughter.
According to MTI information, a young man prepared for the burning of a criminal act before the testimony of the murder heavy weapons hidden in the place of action.
The weapons and the circumstances of her use are investigated by the police officers.
The Varsovian Bursa took effect on a offer for the buy of the powder
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech Crowns - offered the Varsovian valuable papers for buying a graduate packet of the action of the Prague Action Birrs.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw valuable papers, confirmed the proposal that the Polandian side had affected, although the Czech Warsaw Bursa from the potential new owners of the Prague Boards had already been released before.
D'em is the fact that the owner of the Warsaw garden is the state.
99 per cent of the action is in the hand of the Polish State, which wants 60 percent of the price papers to sell for several months.
As writes the Czech Economic Journal E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest amount offered by interesters in the Prague Board.
According to the Czech letters, the proposal of a videoburse of valuable papers, the transatlantic actionburse Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, the London Burza and Deutsche B√∂rse have been provided.
The leader of the Prague Action Bridge Peter Koblic said last week that the Warsaw worth papers would be the worst new owner of all interesters, and he did not recognize that this could lead to the conclusion of the Prague Action Guard in the future.
The value of the raw valuation of valuable papers is estimated by the experts in the share markets for 5-10 billion.
According to the Actionary Agreement, approximately 90 per cent of action could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Action Board is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent, followed by the Czech Republic of 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.l. with 13,5 percent.
Financial crisis in view of European papers
In their outer comments, the international financial crisis has already been identified by the previous European letters "once September 11".
For a global financial disaster, we can thank the American President, rebuilding the Roman Republic's accusation. The President did not even be able to dismiss his own party to support the payable law, which is the purpose of the correction of this relief...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, who was a billioner and investor Warren Buffett, could talk about the second September 11th.
The part of the Madrid pressure is also seeing a vineyard in Washington.
According to the journal El Mundo, the world economy has brought to the deterioration of darkness of political leadership.
The risk of the loss of the American financial system continues to grow, which will finally pay the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after voting in Congress, it is dangerous that Washington does not offer a political crisis solution.
The world economy increases in air - just in the moment when one of the largest changes in capitalism.
The threat can't be remembered anymore, the women's journal Days-Anzeiger shows.
The single states may still be able to refund money institutions to save the circle and tax chargers can be saved from crack.
Of course, if there are other banks, they will be enough for money or other improvizations.
Inspectively, Member States of the European Union must be transferred through their national egoism and simplify control over developed financial markets.
Only on Monday, there were more than 100 billion euros, at the vineyard Der Standard, which believes that like the Americans will have to be more real in the interest of the crisis solution to the caps and European tax payers.
The European Union is a crisis, which is like conami's old continent, yet she has not been seriously concerned.
"Supporters" don't need to have a billion euro straight, but it would be good if they were definitely determined in which case it is reasonable to cover the money of tax chargers so that I may be more damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flights of a scarlet
What would be the best method of developing the potential to prevent the swimming, not the imitation of the detectors of the transfusions of the world of nature?
For example, in the morning.
The strategic idea of the surprising project represented in the Japanese CEATEC campaign was given to Nissan's engineers. It was the way to set up a new generation of systems for defence.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan built a biomimetical robotic system of management of type BR23C, robotized mini-motors, which are equipped with the properties of the wheel, with a final purpose of helping to create a system that can eliminate all the weapons.
"Every year, each of them creates a own personal Area of a cargo, which actually likes our security pack," explained Kazuhiro Doi, the general director of the label for the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ \ . .
They play a significant role of covered eyes, which often allow to see in all directions in the raw angle more than 300 degrees.
To copy the covered eye, the engineers saw the idea of a laser distance.
It identifies overcomings from distance to 2 metres before BR23C in 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the palub microprocessor, which is immediately changed to a operation for the suspension of the swimming.
The interruption is captured during the break of the second, then the robotized car starts to imitate the moves of the wheel and rotation of the round that is necessary to break the wheel immediately change the direction.
In the case of any existing system, this exhaustive manage is completely instinct.
"If it wasn't so, robotic cars couldn't respond enough to interrupt me," explains Toshijuki Ando, leader of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must respond instinctly and immediately, because this is the most vulnerable and internal level of safety pack, within which the box is currently considered unexpected.
The whole process has to reflect what she's doing so that she's dismissed by the other sheep.
This process should not be longer than the swimming eye.
This move cannot be moved up, down or down, and can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction to which the wheel can be rounded.
Instead of unnecessary options offered in the event of a robotic car, it was only applied to the possibility of movement, delay and delay.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries which are easier and have higher energy wind, which means that they have longer life than lithium-iont variants.
According to Andoa, there is an important instinct, intellectual reaction, no ability to process, but less then to store data.
This mechanism must be processed and responsible only for a few income signals in second.
It is not necessary to store them and react them using intuitia and logic based on data from previous maneurs, therefore it is still using only a memory of size of some kilobytes.
You don't remember with giga or megabyte capacity.
It is the first step to develop the use of a immediate avoidance which, according to Nissana, could be reached into the manufactured vehicles during ten years.
Another option of application may represent a connection to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after dismissing the travel, leads a motorist to the specified end target.
Damn kid has a name already.
The Economy Safety Act of 700 billion dollars, which is to be divided into a number of payments and which is the purpose of the redemption of non-quality bank credits, has already a written illustration.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After other negotiations that ended until Sabbath after the north of the United States East Time, the representatives of the Congress were added to the agreement within a few days of the debat on a salvation package at a total of 700 billion dollars, the Agency informed the Agency.
"We have achieved a significant progress," announced Nancy Pelosi, Democracy President of the Sneemovny representatives, which has only been recorded by the agreement.
The company on the package also supported both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The Ministry of Finance of Henry Paulson stated, "The programme will work and will be able, but it must take further steps."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday in 8 hours of Washington (and in two hours a middle European time), but no special accommodation on the bourgeois had been affected.
The legal standards which are heard on behalf of the Law on the new economic stability of 2008, which the programme is to be established, will vote on Monday first to the representatives of Sneem, then a series of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosian on Saturday evening, after the agreements were welcomed to the White House.
"In the progress that was reached tonight, we are quiet and we appreciate the effort of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economics," declared the speaker of the White House of Tony Fratto.
The programme was finally different from the Bush's administrative administration, in which it was supposed to be refunded to non-quality valuable papers guaranteed by hypoteches once a total of $700 billion.
Now it is possible to lose the maximum half of the amount of 700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after that of the matter as expected on Monday decision of the Congress, and the Ministry of Finance will buy for them valuable papers guaranteed by hypoteches, which are evaluated as an unquality, and the rest of 100 billion dollars will be dependent on the Chairman's decision.
The programme will be controlled by the special congregation, which will also be the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The finding of the second half of 700 billion dollars will be dependent on the next decision of the Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may, in the meaning of the law, apply combined tactics: it can currently purchase non-quality credits, hypoteches and valuable papers guaranteed by hypoteches, respectively other "unified" credits.
Rescue may be carried out directly and communicated to the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The standard allows the undertakings concerned to participate in the security programme in which the Ministry finances the guarantees for the guarantees of the undertakings representing anxiety, and then the company will pay the price corresponding to the highest expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the need for the compliance with the relevant requirements of the American financial system to be charged up to $700 billion, whether it is already going to a large buying of bad bags, to ensure or to prevent the systemic risk associated with the destruction of some of the large money institutions.
"We will do the necessary steps, and they were ready to carry the law as soon as it is signed," added.
Boss banks who have been in the road and waiting for State assistance, however, can calculate that the government decreases remotely - which is simply called "good fall".
In order to restrict their expenditure only in certain cases, these restrictions will also be dependent on the way helped by the ministerial authorities.
The limitation in principle means that if the Ministry purchases in the field, the tax adjunction will be covered for the golden payments if the bank managers fall, they will be sent to the income.
In the case of direct remuneration of non-quality credits, the Government will aggressively exceed the interest that the money for the management is not exceeded.
It is necessary to add that existing conferences on gold falls are already not changed, limitation is only regarding new contracts, which must be a further stimulation for the programme.
"It is the first case in the American history when a legal restriction on the remuneration of general directors will be in force," commented the Chairman of the Committee for Financial Services of the Representatives, democracy Barney Frank.
Furthermore, the State in banks is the right to obtain a share, which reduces the risk of tax chargers, since when the economic and with it, as well as the back-up banks, they can also be made on this transaction.
The plan of compensation includes that the Chairman must submit to the Congress in the next five years, which indicates the way that tax payers are expected to be returned from the financial sector.
Obviously, both parties had votes expressed in relation to the plan of doubt.
"This is what the American citizens did not ask us, this is the same dollar of tax payers not protected," said the Republican Congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohia Mary Kaptur judges that for the adoption of the provisions, those who are responsible for Wall Street's distortion.

Barack Obama and McCain are for a backup package
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates both of the large American parties, on Sunday, have assured their support of the Governing Package to save banks in value of $700 billion, but they are also politicians who require the Ministry of Finance.
After a few days of the Congress and the administrative representatives of the Congress negotiation, it was promptly notified on Sunday: the basic agreement on the bank's backing package was closed.
The financial package with the aim of the Wall Street crisis and the deteriorated credit market has become a central question of the presidential campaign.
Like Obama, so McCain is the most appropriate of both candidates that would take the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most cruel investigations at the same time, when the economic issues were reached, Obama received a certain advantage again, and McCain's advice, which made it possible after the Republican Convention of Sarah Palin's nomination at the post of the Vice-President.
Obama issued on Monday on the pre-optional reservation in Detroitu on ÃÅa that the package law would be 700 billion ÃÅe to adopt the Congress.

Overview of the printing of German language
The right camp is uninterrupted, only electors inside have become more self-conscious - so it analyses the weak result of the CSU in Bavorsk Der Spiegel.
Haderovs are ready to govern the Russian in order to protect the red-swarm coals.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the Internet issue of the German reporting magazine, Franz Walter broke in his article with the name "Bavorska revolution will feed his father" because of the dramatic damage of the CSU.
According to a known politology, the CSU erosion started for a lot before its office was taken by the Beckstein-Huber duo.
Christian socialists have renewed Bavory for decades, and now these modern citizens are just turning away from them.
Congregation of the period is the problem of the whole Christian democracy, thus Angely Merkel.
Debakl was not completely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process that could be predicted almost ten years: an unproportional hegemonie of one State side ended.
10 years ago, in 1998, CSU was 47.7 per cent, first under 50 per cent.
This repeated three years ago at the elections in Bundestag in 2005, so so often at the Stoiber period.
It is the cause of modernization that the CSU has performed in this country, which will feed her parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but in time they have been very disturbed. Secularization, results of education, seating Germans from East and North in the developments of the regions of Bavorska, however, could have been unconsequently unconsequently for the CSU electors.
Modernisation is associated with the growing opportunities, which also has its visible political investigations.
The right camp is uninterrupted, only electors inside have become more self-conscious, critical, self-speaking.
It is also obvious that the CSU has been mostly divided in classical civil levels in the last weeks; people in free call, animals, maturity units and high school education.
This is what the CSU support has already fallen under 40 percent.
The press (depresse.com)
Conservates a visionary journal with the name "Who, with whom? The presidents are in the issues of coalic sustainable" means a deceived internal policy resulting from cancer elections.
SPUE wants to act with the UVP.
The AVP orders the Migration of SPUE in its internal matters.
BZO seems to be opened to all negotiations, green is not yet wanted to be on the coal.
The elections are behind us, now all runs around the coal; the presidents have not been able to watch their cards in the public television debates.
The President SP√ñ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to act with √ñVP.
And the SPUE wants to show that cooperation with both parties is probably possible - in some social countries and in social partnership.
A question whether to present a coal with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of √ñVP, as a officer, left Faymann open.
As he said, the course of Sch√ºssel-Molter was voted on every fall.
Repeating this Directive is not taken into account.
Molter reacted carefully on the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly be successful if Faymann is trying to meet the internal AEVP.
If his side chooses an opposition or enters the coal, then it is completely opened on the side, these questions should be resolved inside the EUVP.
The President BZ√ñ J√∂rg Haider was opened again in all directions.
"And we've prohibited the red-black coals, we're ready to take the government responsibilities," said Haider.
Jarok: It is necessary to prolomit the repeated circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European sum of equality, which visits France, the current presidential state of the European Union for years.
Livia Jarok, lawyer of the European People's Party for Fidesh, as one of the main vocational speakers in his addressed plenary message, turned attention to the segregation in the school, because it is one of the most serious injustices of the Roma's children, and also the most serious overcome of their application.
He started - the name of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Work and Social Affairs, and Vladimir ≈†pidl, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Options.
They have seated between the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organizations for the protection of rights and civil associations in equal opportunities.
According to the printing offices of the Group of European posters, Fide≈° Yar√≥k warned that, according to discrimination in the collection of work forces, Romans are extracted from the European Labour Market in particular of their low education.
"The majority of youths of Romans has no medium-school education, and because of a bad quality of basic education, the higher level of education can only achieve an intimate part of them."
The Jarocco further highlighted that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in applying other human rights.
Investment in early education of the children of Rome may mean the strengthening of the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the lawyer, it is necessary to confirm the home of these relations in the largest circles - between the Roman and the Nero Children.
As long as the Roman student ends the school, it will be more likely to have a productive member of the workforce market; the taxation of revenue and the needed tax will contribute to the national budget.
"The Romans have the right of their State citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to ensure the elimination of their highly quality and separate education," Livia Yar√≥k said.
According to the lawyer, the coherence of the European Union with the view of objectives and negotiations is necessary to achieve the immediate implementation of the school department processes, and it is primarily important to maintain existing and planned anti-discrimination Regulations.
"The increasing circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be extended to the Roman children's opportunity to participate in the future of Europe as a full-right citizen," Jarok requested.
Everyone, in the sign "European Year of Equality", is assessed by the objective of the European Equality Summary, organized each year from the Lower Meeting in Berlin, to ensure a single forum that helps to achieve equality objectives and to eliminate discrimination at the level of all Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary charity
The judgment of the corresponding dua Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the accurate electoral debakl, the debate on personal issues has not yet been denied by the bathroom CSU.
The President of Erwin Huber and the earthquake Prime Minister G√ºnther Beckstein can still stay at their places, the question is until this favor takes place.
The judgment of the dance, which suffered a disasterous loss of votes of 17 per cent, will decide the last October week of the extraordinary congress of the party.
The members of a very criticised spirit were in any case allowed to hear that at their beds they would be stuck out of all forces.
The disturbed members of the fraction and the bases were so quiet that, due to the loss of absolute ability, requested a day after the "babor conami" of personal investigations.
Five years ago - true, even under the leading of Edmund Stoiber at the top of the career - the Christian-social Union has obtained 60.7 percent, now, year after shopping against Stoiber, but their forces were only 43.4 percent.
The CSU was a 18 percent of the German HDP producing in Bavorian for 46 years.
Even though conservators in the southern social country have a key importance for Hungarian economics, high positions, but in the future everyone will be worthwhile affected to the coalition.
One of the first characters of the reorganization within the party is that a member of a difficult expert team, which starts a reviewing negotiation on the eventual coalition of the Monochov Government with the Liberal FDP, respectively with the right-oriented collection of the Liberal Elector, will also be the president and the Social Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, which is considered as a possible representative of Huber.
It is an ironic sentence that Gabriel Pauli, whose exhibition against Stoiber, has been used to carry out a duo Huber-Beckstein, but they have made an unfriendly short process with ambitional community policy.
The leaders of the CSU are now focusing on their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transitional period, the active role of Stoiber, which has yet contributed to the outcome of the background, was called an ex-president of the country, and some of the CSU was called on 28 September the most patient day of its political career.
On Monday, Huber broke out a number of discovery notes on the CDU address, according to which they would serve more support from the sister side.
Other CSU policies interpreted the destruction as a warning for CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections in Bundestagu in September 2009, Merkel can be able to be a Officer if the CSU, playing a significant role in the total success in 2005, does not set the common forces on the feet.
According to Merkel, who has severely hidden her disappointment because of the physician, has lost the position of CSU a negative impact on the Berlin big coal.
What is, of course, relative: to treat the vulnerable CSU, and the crisis of social democrats continues.
The SPD reached in Bavorska with 18,6 percent of the weakest result since 1946.
Luxury:opposition - 110:0
In the weekly elections, no opposition lawyer received the Belarus Parliament.
This can be explained according to Russian observators by the welfare and stability of Alexander Lukasche's country, but according to the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe (OBSE), which has been made in the calculation of votes.
OBSE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not know the options.
Although the 110-member legal congregation of 10-million countries has taken up opposition for ten years, the opposition associated with the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before the last elections was seriously hoped that Lukashenka, who had left on the basis of the changes in the settlement in the elections with debatable progress in 2006 and the quarterly renewed its presidential mandate, would "consent" this time in Parliament to open a number of opposition commitments.
The ODS also left from the previously considered boycot.
In the background of the observatory expectation, in Russia, the economics still stronger dependent on Belarus - which has continued to reduce the impact of the Russian import of land and has contributed to BelTransgaz, the owner gases of the country, in Russia, to improve the relationships with the European Union, in which the Beltransgase policy is valuable as antidemocracy and the further higher position of the policy is not sufficient to enter into force.
At the previous release, OBSE showed that when the preview campaign was evaluated, the preliminary campaign focused on the position of the movement, and none of the lack - such as the prohibition of the candidate for the third opposition candidates.
The Monday OBSE news report has already been eligible for the campaigns during which the opposition candidate could in principle not appear in printing, especially for the fact that opposition cannot be present to the vote calculation.
In addition, the opposition can be felt in the political system only improvement: Politicians were released to freedom and Minsk is willing to travel with Moscow and to the smaller confrontation, when it continues to refuse to recognize the Georgia South Osetia and Abchasia, whether Russia, with which the Belarus is designed on the Union's paper, considers these two territory as an independent month.
"We've made two steps forward and one of these, but the most important is that he started dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said our letter Alexander Milinkeviƒá.
According to the advisory candidate from the presidential elections in 2006, it is demanding that this remains, even though "the power has been emphasised to leave the unimportanceful parliament of one member of opposition."
In view of the results of opposition, it does not plan protest action, but it is trying to give the electors a message on the need for economic reforests.
"In this way, of course, we have many problems, the opposition lists we have to print in Russia, the distribution of the transactions of the local authority, and so I see that the change supports what more people, even among elders," Milinkeviƒá said with the indication that the Luka≈°enkov's regime, which considers its greatest success to create social security, does not constitute the right or officially the most supported level of travellers.
"For the debt of the country and the growth of trade deficit, it is just a question of the time when social security will be injured by 'bounding silence rubbits'," judges Milinkeviƒá.
The Russian observators were determined as democratic.
The leader mission of the Community of independent states Sergei Lebed, Russian rapporteur agent Ria News, said that "humans don't believe in words but acts," so the absence of opposition is nothing else than the evidence of the growth of the white-wheelders.
Brunetta: "From now's dinner before work"
It's first in the history of the Pal√°ce Chigi, which was introduced by the turning door at the arrival and leave of employees.
However, since today, this new measures against ungling people are going to work, against those who are swift and then go to coffee at work at the time.
The news against the lents has been presented today to the Minister for Public Administration, Renatam Brunetta, and to the Secretary-General of the President-in-Office of Maur Masi.
"The turning door - says Brunetta ‚Äì are a tool for better jobs, higher performance, more presence and more services," states the Minister.
"The new period of responsibility and transparency will now be opened.
It's about reform," says Brunett still.
The Chigi palace will complete the introduction in all the constructions of the Council's presidential.
For Masi, "the choice of turning doors is also important in symbolic view."
The Secretary-General assured that the workers had no meetings, "It was a joint process with the work and cooperation of all."
Soon, no breakfast in the work at the time; no coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "It's nothing better than a hard cappu in seven hours."
During one of the high schools for public administration
In Rome, the Minister will finally notify that in three months, the in presence of public employees for diseases was reduced by 50%, which means more than 60 thousand persons annually in work."
And it adds that it is necessary that the Italian public administration becomes more executive
"their payment dynamic ‚Äì explains the Minister ‚Äì has doubled in the last 8-10 years as regards the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage."
In the meantime, thousands of public employees were meeting to refuse Brunett's decree standards in accordance with the request of supported Codacons.
"When the Minister for Public Administration today represents the numbers relating to the low absence in the work of disease ‚Äì writes a group for the protection of consumers ‚Äì the nation of 'fill lenox' is still growing.
In Italy, there are thousands of productive and correct employees in the public administration who have been endeavored to declare the war of illegal standards set out in the decree."
In Taru, it will be protested in particular against the exemption of a relief to a disease that depends on activity; the extension of the period in which it is possible to verify the time limits of control visits and the final standards included in the new Ministerial establishments.
Workshop, Napolitano: "Resolutional prevention"
Each day, in Italy there will be 2.500 employees, three persons will die and twenty-seven remain invalid.
Inail values confirm that in 2007 we have an estimate of ‚Üì00 died by the result of work taxes.
These values testify the seriousness of a sign that remains one of the main elements of death and causes at least a double death in comparison with murders.
In order to resume the attention of institutions, social and information boxes on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th national day of the victims of employees set on the second week in October.
"The inquiry data extended by Anmila and the same tragical reports of these days confirm the significant issue of work security," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in the report sent to the President Anmilu, the National Association for Municipality and invalidity for work, Petro Mercanda.
The head of the State expresses its live interest in a continuous common effort to security at workshops, to protect vulnerable workers, to help families of victims and to participate in public changes."
"Natively a rebellious 'success' has been brought up, sincerely divided faces in the face of tragedies, which is in its range of disturbances in media and age of public opinions, but every day's abilities offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamic."
Napolitano doesn't hide that "only there is a problem of resources: it is decided to invest in education and information.
A special importance is to gain many initiatives made in school so that young people who hold the world of work can get clearer knowledge.
It is necessary to warn about this event, not to look forward to its concernful social seriousness, to apply and improve legislation standards.
The President Gianfranco Fini, from his side, stated: "When the death of the dead results of the rate of work creates absolutely critical social status, as it causes the knowledge of each of us and brings all institutions to a convinced effort to end this status."
"With the facts of work, it seems that they show a certain position of turn, however, it doesn't prevent the dead end of the job of the rate is as alarming," said President Anmilu Pietro Mercanda.
"They didn't want just that this "snake of decreasing" leads to less attention, because just at the moment when the attention is rising, the tragedy will blow out.
"We believe that generally it is still a little bit to stop the problem of the race and there are many activities that can have effect on this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion, that Mercande's highlighted ‚Äì to increase controls and inspections, but also stronger in the training of workers, and soon from school.
"There is still needed another effort - added ‚Äì as regards communication and participation in public changes.
But it is most important to have a sense of responsibility from employees to the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social effect."
Finally, Mercanda stated that it was about progress and degeneration of the right to the deficiency of the victim's work and the "support of support" to which the system has been obtained in recent years."
"The purpose is, therefore, to return to the assurance guarantee of the employee - added ‚Äì because the judgment of those who are hurt cannot depend on spontaneousness or dealing time from the time of the lawmaker."
Mp3 players have been accused, have a risk hearing
Listen to a longer music voice and use of transmissible music devices as Mp3 players can cause persistent damage to the audience.
According to the present publicationd notice of the European Commission, which, in one of the official reports extended in Brussels, refers to the amendment to the Committee on Health Risices that have been recently established and identified (Cssseri) Eu.
"From this deep view ‚Äì we read in notes ‚Äì shows that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years by means of transmissive musical devices, a week more than one hour a day and maintain the device for high volume, risk the permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I'm concerned that so many youths who often use transmissive musical devices and mobile phones at high acustic levels can unconsciously hurt their listener in an inappropriate way," admits Meglen Kuneva.
"From decade detections, the leader continues to rise, and it must be reacted.
The most important is that we need to highlight the consumer and publish these information.
We need to continue to check the already existing control systems in the light of this detection, so that they may become complete and keep a step with a new rubber."
Brussels requested on the independent Committee that this problem be examined in view of the high use of transmission of musical devices and the increased number of young people expressed by this puzzle.
"Scients - concluded the Executive Officer of Eu ‚Äì confirm that it is necessary to take care of, and the European Commission now will check together with the remaining members and parties who have raised the problem, which measures would eventually be made, and so better protect children and young people from sharing the sounds that are transferred by musical devices and similar equipment."
At the current time, there is a European security standard which limits the volume of transmissible music devices to 100 dB, but there is anxiety about the damage of the service that can be caused to overcome the exposure of similar forms of sound.
It is very possible to limit these damages by seeking solutions as a reduction of the level and the duration of the exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that the transmission of musical devices, if they use music voice ( more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will overcome the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum allowed sound on the work.
Those who listen to music in such signs after a longer time risk the permanent loss of the listener after five years.
This problem should be affected by 5-10% of such devices and their quantity can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
I say, Germany leaves the Commission free transition for the future of the main city
We'll start today, in March, we'll close, in June we'll have sums.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers "the Commission for the Future of the Master City of Rome", which has meet today in his new seat behind Caracall's woods.
In six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will set up a mandate for Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Giunta and the General Council of Assessment of Analysis and Projects will be closed in June so that they may represent a strategic plan for Rome with the "official investigation" Campidoglia and his counselor Giannio German.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all political, social and cultural thoughts ‚Äì wants to highlight Germany ‚Äì It will have to ensure the development of Rome, which will finally use the political decisions remaining in Giunta e General Council.
It's not about any change, but only about the effort to have a place where to process a large project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then will be released because this institution must have a precise time term.
In June, the Officer notifies that we will represent a strategic plan and use the work that the Commission has made for the future of the main city of Rome."
To those who accusate the Commission of independence, because its reduction is binding, the German sector will say: "All depend on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their opinions.
If they are quality, as we are by the Commission of Attali, and so I am still in Rome, its contribution will be decided.
Policy is too often addressed to daily problems and advantages that will come from time to time.
Instead, we want to look longer and further, in the deepest perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and his future.
Moreover, the elder of Rome wants to highlight that "This Commission is not even an unfair business or blaf: it is totally free, Roman citizens or euros and serves to think and involve the best intelligence that the main city has."
For Germany, in fact, "the strategy needs to have as a standard point, not definitively or in moveable, so that our city may allow an access to the level that is necessary, and think of the united spirit of his future."
The future, which, expressed by the elder of Rome, "see only to the current general border, but will look for much further" not only in the option of the future metropolitical city and its legal status of the main city, but "this also includes the role that Rome can and must be performed as the main city of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The anti-American president, he knows why.
One known American President wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be a second anti-American President."
It was Jimmy Carter, who decreased the US economy by his decisions and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks against Obam are just growing at the time when the election date is close.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
But obama has a worm: He thinks he will get to the highest post of a nation who had all the two operators and five black senators."
At the time of these attacks they do not say much; these are the attacks of the racial powder and they do not answer the question of the electors: will be a good president? And then we have a warning; everyone say that Obama wins and with a great shock.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not by the brain.
One of the newspapers from Mississippi, from the south of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the election cabinet we know well who gives his voice of the American patriot.
It's going to go on one page of the American mentality that remained shit until the last time.
Tell what you want, finally, we'll take care of itself, who's gonna worry about whether Obam or McCain."
There are people who swear: if they should win Obama, they're gone from America.
It's things that have never been declared yet, it seems to be almost certain of the success of the black candidate.
However, through all these views of democracy, George Bush's main weapons.
1500 people asked: What error did Bush do during his mandate? Eighty nine percent answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with a bathroom in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost life, and the Americans haven't been forced to break up.
Yet, Iraq became an Iraq for Bus's weakness.
Whoever goes to Georgie W will have to make a big job.
The United States Economy Colaps also felt: in newspapers there are a period of survey, and many accused the Internet, "building" pressure.
The Research Center was asked about five hundred journalists for their professional status and for the presence of future.
Today, almost all pessimist journalists are about their future.
However, the question was not openly said that they had less anxieties about confidence.
It doesn't feel the isolation like ever.
The problem is for American newspapers of money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis in 2008 is a devastated economic model.
Despite these newsrooms, in the room where editors work to give newsgroups, they are a major problem.
According to the questioned journalists, there is a problem that should be resolved whether we do not want the traditional journalism to change in principle as it understands large publicity.
The American journalist's progressive, but complex pessimism.
Six of the ten pressure journalists and executive elders are convinced that a newspaper is a wrong way.
In the local area, an executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
Increasing delivery is going to the Internet, which many people say, as "builder" pressure.
"Economic pressure", on which journalists warn, has increased to 79%.
Five hundred questioned journalists have admitted that they're going to √Ça in √Ça, that they're "doing something good for their newspaper."
The biggest ruin in the American newsgrooms is among those who drive newsrooms ‚Äî that means leaders ‚Äì and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are certain that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value is decreased by 23%.
This has something to do with the "true work".
The leaders who believe that they lose work for three years are 47% at national level.
As regards journalists, they move to 30%.
It's about "fair work" relating to the personal (on our editors, ndr) in America is still on a day order.
Only 13% of journalists are working on the composition.
In such a major nation as Usa, with three million people and thousands of newspapers, journals, dimes, television and Internet employees often offer what they want, so it is the question to take or leave.
The leader is eligible for major payments and editors can also produce ten thousands of dollars a monthly free of money payment and guarantee.
As regards the authorised, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a number of days after the third year to the arrival of fifty days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own knowledge, are often sick during one year.
It's just a climate question.
UNIPOL: SOUD in Rome, DANIL COPPOL IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Court of Justice of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse the consequence of the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who requested to be moved from his city, Grottaferrats, to the residence in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankrots in relation to the anti-professional sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process on own costs, the last week of release from household, which was changed to a needed permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, requested that a reality businesser can change the place of residence from the foreign city to the main town.
However, according to the Court of Justice, this movement (with which pm has been issued) would allow him to influence his company and to gain evidence that are accused of him.
Elity in danger
This show has already occurred a few days ago when the Commission of representatives voted against the salvation plan for 700 billion dollars to the White House presented: a significant part of the Americans was more interested and interested in the resort of Wall Street than on the salvation of the economy.
It also confirms yesterday New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis is divorced by the Republican side, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, the smaller, coherent to federal institutions and business, and their new soul, which is to preserve, enemy's face from Washington, and the world's finance, especially strong in states in the central part and south.
The soul that was arrogantly shown by the vote I spoke at the beginning.
However, this just sensitive thing is only an example of changes, large changes that the current economic landing already shows: not only in the United States, but at all of the west and perhaps not only here.
Like in Usa, this crisis seems to work as an accelerator of raw animals already incubated in the new climate and finally exploded into light.
In the context of these animals, the renewal, the exceptional survival of the market, the double category of the State-force in relation to a certain regeneration of the economy.
The crisis is, in fact, the crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong benefits in the ship, but in particular in the largest way of the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one country.
What has now created a political problem for those who lead him: it means how to respond to the poisons and protests of people and families that are other than the electors.
The short crisis appears to be economic worldwide, but political is almost extremely national.
Political internationality seems to be essentially outside the game or has nothing to add: a clear evidence of the European Union, which is divided between different interests and different state strategy, which cannot be decided for one common policy line.
So everyone expects the principles of the Government of each individual State, salvation plans, market survival, new rules and mainly the distribution of funds: at the moment when we get quietly, only the states of economic ability, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to make everything right.
And also their own needs and permissions to use them: two sources of unpair values, in certain circumstances which may not have any market and any international organization ever be able to be available in the same way.
This new emphasis, which causes a state-national crisis, is finally in absolute consistency with the further expertise that is trying to judge the last economic progress to one factor associated with it: border responsibility.
Paradoxally, while we were convinced that we entered into the Kingdom of Network, still more sophisticated, imaginary, while we were convinced that the world funds had already been predicted to rule the world, we had nothing to realize that our future would still have to be more to cope with such small non-ternal things like water, oil, oil.
All things that would have been said can be transferred from one place to the other, but in any case, absolutely, to the area of the Space, are connected.
So whoever becomes their rulers, it's probably a lot more painting in the hand than anyone I'm not eating, and who's able to live in the place, without oil, and without water.
I'm getting to the second newspaper, however, which predicts evil.
Whoever speaks about the territory, state, government, is inevitably speaking about politics, so the leadership.
With regard to the economic crisis, it seems that two convergence indications are created.
On the one hand, notice that it is objectively necessary for authorization, request for someone who could be capitated.
On the other hand, the wheel is discredited against existing leadership, especially the economic, which has shown the same unexpected and full of dark places.
And together, something more deep and in a certain sense of disappointment, discreditation, impatience, feeling of incapacity and inappropriacy that are trying to control the entire government class in more western countries.
It seems that it is still more spread in the wide mass of the population of conviction than that their actions are the same as the thoughts of an annual elite, as their feeling and residence, as their culture in the right sense of saying that Elita has already convinced its time and is anxious to the views of adversity.
The request for governance is quickly survived from underground, but the strong movement to remove government classes and traditional political arrangements is shown in recent election ‚Äúreferences‚Äù or in unexpected changes of collective injuries in the last and last time, from the conservative approach in the Russia-Bavors to the fall of American congressors in Greece, to the resistance of the American congresses against Bush (you may have to do the rights of Italy).
We have the idea that traditional elites, their sides, their programmes, but also their ceremonies, their news, their credited intellectuality, someone would say their format, have still more problems to understand, so to represent, which, not since today, is created in deep western companies and that the economic crisis rebuilds, grows, potentially excites.
Before this, it would be overwhelmed to talk about the persistent mass rebellion.
But we can't say that it means to have very open eyes.
Super lepidle to walk after walls
Convince gravity laws thanks to super lepidle and in the future walk by walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of different American research centers, and now the four teams of institutions are very close to him.
Scientists were able to maintain the stokilogramme body attached to the vertical wall using only 2.5 centimeters of quadrimeters.
STUDIUM ‚Äì American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers in Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute and Air Force Explorer.
The material that has found the team of researchers is the development of materials already existing that use the special carbon structure, named carbon traps.
‚ÄúWe can imagine as a series of trumpets placed as an arranged hop of spaget‚Äù explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute in Atlantic.
Scientists were inspired by the feet of a gecon, covered by microscopic boys that allow animals to ensure perfect completion.
The tests carried out on different materials, such as the glass, Teflon and the nice paper, showed that the new lepidle is ten times stronger than the feet of these plastics, and at the same time they are simply blowing from the wall,‚Äù explains Liming Dai, the Engineer Faculty University.
CHODIT TO THAT THIS material could be useful as a provisional lepidle‚Äù adds Liming Dai.
Hope to walk in the walls like Spiderman? I hope yes, but researchers think of a far less fascinating use as a connection of electrical devices, because the long-term carbon tubes are heating and electricity.
Others could be related to aircraft space engineering .
In the past, no super herds.
Next RESUM ‚Äì The University in Berkley, California, is also a research of a new lepidle.
In one article of the magazine American Chemical Society, the Californians represented lepidlo formed from micro-flakes as hairs that are cleaning themselves from the powder moves on the border to remain perfect.
Medicines: never with juice
Take care of the grip, pomegranate and jabble juice.
If you take these drinks that are mainly consumed in the soil, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-free medicines, their use changes the strength or reduction of health-severity results.
To David Bailey, professor Western Ontario University in London, highlights the risk of juices as well as prepared, so fresh in combination with use of some medicines, at the 263. National meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, it calls a new challenge: enough is one graphical, poor and jabble juice to reduce the needed life of some protecting medicines, to cancel their successful effects and the health of patients.
The Grep Juice has already been accused that it is responsible for increased to the toxic effects of some antiarithmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological medicines.
ARTICLES IN RIZIK ‚Äì Reported itself the Italian Medical Agency in the information bulletin two years ago and burst the doctors and patients not to appreciate the dangers resulting from this mixture and to give attention to what they drink if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEW GRAPEFRUIT ‚Äì According to experts, the potassium and jabble juice also contains substances that disturb the medicines.
Long list of rubbers of throated grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruby's call, Director of the National University of Milan: "These discoveries with the most different international and national medical agencies, which eventually provide and exchange information for medicines.
Thus, read illustration of the medicines you receive and if you get to something unexpected, do not be disappointed, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for a clearing‚Äù has explained an expert for the Agency.
Nobel for the Economy of Paul Krugman
Nobel's price was assigned to Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the location of economic activity.
Krugman is the 55-year-old Novoke≈àan, who teaches at Priceton University and is a known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in relation to Bush's administrative, economic and political steps.
A few months after the atents in September 2001, in the days of Enron, Krugman foretold in one comment issued in New York Times that the second event will be, in the meaning of investigations on the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
Reply, which called a polymenic, which was calculated after a year, but that was apparently accurate.
‚ÄúI am surprised and shocked, with which the collapses such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest, Krugman declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenza Biniho Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is "the economy of great importance" but also the popularizer who has"velope aggression, especially critical against the forces of the Liberal Administration of Bush".
Open Office, we have the third version of the package "anti-Microsoft" here
It's the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, open source package, which aims to get to more, from home to office, professionals to public administration, as a freely known Microsoft Office alternative.
After an annual work of volunteers controlled by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office shows wide publicity with various news: to welcome the screen and to revised and improved opening windows are added further, far more basic, as compatibility for operations, Apple Mac OS X system and supporting the new ODF format (Open Document Format) , the last ISO standard version.
The presentation is also co-operated with Office Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document and with the new Microsoft plugin (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are special models such as that allows PowerPoint to reduce the dimensions of the presentation of PowerPoint, for example useful for transmission by electronic road, or the option to transfer the PDF folder to the model of graphical performance and to keep the side view.
We can still create documents "PDF hybrids" from this view, which are like the typical graphics of the Adobe format and have the properties of the table processor or the text program.
Cooperation is a element that has gained many improvements within application programmes: in the excellence it is possible to work between different holders and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text programme, one color is assigned to each cooperation to the comments to make clearer identification in the review phase.
Some companies also work on the transfer of some Open Offices to the Web (on the cloud), and in the next weeks, the final result should be stopped.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, was added to the rational version that is located on the mirror from the fifth.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the package is also available for operating Linux system.
The installation cd may also be sent to request at home or at work.
And if the issue of freedom can be an extension to households, just on the business of Open Office has a lot of packages and can already be calculated with the various projects performed in the public administration and schools.
And there are no training offers, constructions and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could be opened by business perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main models: Writer, for video write replacer Word; Calc is a table processer that replaces Excel; Impress for presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase is a program that allows to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and when we consider that we are at least 3 million and 600 thousand today, with the issue of a new version it is possible that this estimated number can be convinced.
The results of Kohla are also positive, it's the fourth case in a
New post in the last case of the Tour de France: this is about Rakuering Bernhard Kohla, from Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the best top trick.
The report was sent to the L'Equipe journal pages.
26th anniversary Kohl is the fourth leader to call on Cera, Epo third generation, after Italies Riccard Ricc√≥ and √ÇPepoli and Germany Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the blood samples of Kohla fall into those performed in the last weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Mala.
If the control analysis confirms the positiveness of Cera, Rakushan will lose the third place on Tour and will have to take place for two years of disability.
The Cohla's position report on Epo third generation confirms the French Antido Agency's Chef Pierre Bordry, who announced the Press, that he already informed the outcome of the Russian Government authorities.
In 26th year, Rakushan was located at the gradual wins behind Spain Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evansema, and also received a pointed trick of the best top.
IMAGINE: New York Team, is it ITALIA RASISTO?
Italy "as the country of immigrants only changed in the last house to the primary goal of the promotors" adopted with opposition.
It changes a beautiful country to a nation of racists? So it is questioned in a long article of New York Times, which has updated this article on the subject of racism in Italy, and started with the case of young Abdula William Guibre p's of Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milana, because he stole the box of the box.
This case seems to see what New York Times define "paradox north": the north are at the same time those in which "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-private thoughts in the country and the strongest support of the North Life".
In order to confirm the increased attempt between Italy and the promotors, NYT refers to the cases of intolerance from Mil√°n, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturn.
Not just that.
The new legislation requested by the law, which is attempting to enforce the promotion and facilitate the exemption of illegal promotors, is also quoted as an example of climate change in Italy.
Tendence expressed as papa, as the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after he met Benedet XVI in Quirinale, requested the state and church to work together on racism destruction."
Students of lovers of lovers - up to 900 euros per room
Finding land for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to the latest research of Sunia, the Competitive Boards, the student can find a single room in Milan to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Neapoli 650, in Rome 600.
"Eve has already achieved such dimensions that all levels of students have lost the right to study because of the total too high prices that their families have to bear ‚Äì explains the leading offices for Sunia study, Laura Mariani ‚Äì in this town, a great request from students deformed the market in such a way that it has increased the price growing process to the residents."
In most cases, the proposal contains a number of crimes: with free way, not registered, without limited income, associated undertakings.
For Sunji, there is an exceptional principle that could be regulated by the tax review.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milana, in Brianza, the need for one hole of approximately 450 euros, for a single hole room is paid from the minimum price 650 (> Bande Nere) over the average value 800 (> Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum 900 (in Vittoria area).
In Florence there is one liver in the average of 350/400 euros, one room around 700.
In Bologni, where students concentrate in near university areas, there is 250/280 euros for a dog in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single cart.
In Romania, in the Central University Zone (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want 600 euros for a single cotton room, 450 pounds in a double cotton.
The values are lower (550 euros for single-coat) in areas near the final university (Ostiense and Cinecitt√†).
We're looking for the only time if we move to perifers: 300 euros for liver and 450 for a single hot room in Prenestina, Centocelle, and similarly.
In Neapoli, there is 300/450 euros for room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in Polyclinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, they want for 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single hair room.
In smaller cities, prices are extremely lower, but more beneficial impacts on citizens' economy.
In towns such as Perugia, where the most common evidence is for students outside the European Union, there is finally another anomalie: the increase of 25-30% of the payment they want for students in comparison with the Italian.
By the old cine Paradiso, towns break historical rooms
Kinematographic historical sales are closed in multiplex's benefits.
"The city without kine is like blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the Regissor Giuseppe Tornator has successfully documented what happens in large Italian cities, but also in foreign cities.
The process of limitation of cinema, the birth of big multishalls in the area and the follow-up of monosal in the central areas of the cities is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and unrestrainable, but also has all characters of true cultural crime.
Often the historical place of the historical place is as when they came to a friend, a known person with whom we had shared a road and a lot of emotions‚Äù, feels the register of the New Chinese Paradiso, a film that has received the Tornator Oscar 20 years ago and the great price of the rates in Cannes, which has announced the poesie of a worldwide cinema and distress for the way of life that is likely lost forever.
The values obtained by Aneca, the main association of operators, speaks to: In the last five years, 316 kines of the traditional type were closed, and the highest sales were payed mainly in the most important cities: about 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milana, Neapoli, Bologni and Romania, 6 less in Torina, 5 in Palerma.
Amilia-Romagna is in the first place lost 82 cinema sales followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And the evidence that the first responsible for their mistakes is a multi-exemption, are just these three Italian regions that registered the highest number of new Chinese multisale: 195 more payed in Lombardia in the last five years, about 81 and in Toscana, so in Emilia-Romagna.
‚ÄúItalian process has developed irrationally‚Äù says Paolo Protti, President Anecu," it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure that those already existing survivals are, since when one cinema in the city is closed, not all of his visitors are willing to move to a multiplex.
Then we do not even talk about an inadequate income to the fund in the benefit of operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
As regards moral and ethical, the government does not respect existing laws.
For the support of the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed annually.‚Äô
Interesting is the Bologn case, the first Italian city, which cares with closures and decided to find the east signature of the protocol between the communities and Anec, the first of this type in Italy for protection and propagation of small Chinese and historical centers, so in the area.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax impact in the benefits of operators and the benefits of the public in relation to movement: the winds will be able to be a year in a limited transport area and will have special prices to stop and some parkings.
‚ÄúI like this initiative‚Äù says Giuseppe Tornador, and I hope that the remaining cities will follow the example of the Bologly implementing other measures.‚Äù
However, it is sure that to be able to stand against the great power of multiplex, traditional sales must improve the quality of sound and image because today's public is more important.
The defense of the traditional cine was the subject that was actually important: the closure of Super cine in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adultery, was a surprise that convinced me to put up "New Paradiso film", which I thought about for 10 years.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I go through before the already closed Rialth or Quirinal in the street Na¬§, where I shared so many emotions that I shouldn't look at the records of the nice work, I'm turning to the other side.‚Äù
Connection between political and the Mafian 'ndrangheta' group, senior Gioie Tauro in the processing
"Starosta from Gioie Tauro was willing to adapt the elections of the city office according to the interests of the Mafian Group of Piroma."
The accusations that the Guide against Mafia in Kal√°bria reported against an age and age Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone and Rosarna Carl Martellim's business today for external cooperation with the Mafia's organization are difficult.
In the railways also Gioacchino Piroma, an old guard between the clan and the public administration, and his uncle of a lawyer, the name of the boss, already accused of the mafia crimes, deceived to 10 million euros.
"Ignore all legal and moral standards, as well as healthy understanding," writes the State representatives when two local administrations had the desire to pay the consequences of the lawyer to Piroma.
"The Mafia group would allow ‚Äì the judges ‚Äì officially enter into the town offices and facilitate the so significant options of control and administration of public administration."
The President of the Californian Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that " secret agreements between local institutions and organised crime underlines are in its country much: "There are a lot of mafia concentration in which the mafia is stronger than in the remaining, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local policies that have the effects of the "dranghetes, herds who are still unclean."
The prisons from today follow after the prison from July last year that the police showed that the Mafian Group of Piroma had final principles .
Since the end of April last year, the Civil Council of Gioii Tauro has been released since 1991, and there was also the proposed connection between organised crime and local administration - the local policies were released by general administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, president of the Christian Democrats, who at the moment of dissolving was chosen by the head of the right middle coal after the extreme election in May.
He cried to the scandal when Prefecture ordered the General Council to release.
He called for the responsibility of the Minister inside Marca Min ÃÅ‚Äô and charged him that he had all been based on political debts, but the judges of the Rule on Prison signed today explain that the Mafian Group has grown so far as she requested the change of the draft A3.
Out of the other votes made against Dal Torrion, writes the public complaint, has come out "the desire to move the commitments of businesses, the representative of a very close group, as generally known, to Piroma, and to adapt the elections of public administration to the interests of the Mafian Group."
When energy is born from the wall, those big are in the game.
It's an unnecessary lodge that covers over 70% of the surface and now begins to discover great world energy society.
Wools, pumps, throats, disorders are the new sources of unexpected energy on which the cholose looks like Chevron, who is now trying to stretch up the hands on these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for over 100 years, and the research was intensified in 70 years in relation to the first brutal crisis.
When the price of the rope was decreased about 1980, the idea of the use of marine energy came to the side, but now the ecological organization and the new increase of the price of the rope gave a new impulse to the sector.
World Energy Council (ECC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 per cent of the world‚Äôs electricity waste could be covered by using the wheel motion of the sea.
this amount would be a double range of energy that is currently produced in nuclear centres.
Moreover, there's also broadcasts and throats and dishes.
He's gonna attack.
Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to establish equipment in North Portugal.
When this purpose was announced, it seemed to be a major revolutionary step.
After two years of maritime energy, there are still more companies that are seen on maritime energy than traditional energy.
"Chevron studys the Ocean Energy -- a speaker has been held to one company that is linked to the United States' race, in the economic day news of Wall Street Journal, and thinks about the possibility to cooperate with us."
The cooperation we consider is to obtain the approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary for the breakdown of the project for the use of marine energy on the Alaska.
We cannot subestimate this signal, especially when we take into account that just on the United States Alliance is still more difficult and the President Bush has recently arrived with a plan for a new turnover.
Besides Chevron, they follow the trail of marine energy and Ver > Power Inc. from New York and the Ocean Power from New Jersey and then invested sums, even though they are not detailed, they show interest in observers.
Technology, it's needed to be developed.
Experts are talking about ‚â•a, which is still at the beginning, because they don't know what impact the use of marine energy on life.
During the time of the aircraft in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and it does not seem that it would cause great ecosystem problems.
For more energy production, however, it is necessary to use with a higher impact on the middle.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the system of fears that are connected.
The force of the wall that moves with fights up and down is changed by the help of wars and cylindres to hydraulic pressure within these fights.
The pressure spreads the turbine that adds energy to the generator.
Energy gets on the edge of subseaker cabs.
During the projects, four devices of this type are expected only for federal approval and part of energy can be served for military shelves.
Instead, Ver--Power is currently produced energy for the middle and parking by using six pd-sea turbines in the non-East River.
The water movement during the combustion and smoking causes turbine turning, which makes the generator live by this turning movement.
Ver ¬∑ it was estimated that it had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisation for the possibility of use of this energy.
By the wheels, after the throat and after the throat.
Specific interest is at this time the potential of impact and depreciation, as they say in the Institute for Electrical Research.
Although there is an independent factor, the inflation and the dilution are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the wheel, and the fall is even more flexible as the energy source.
Just to the energy of the incidence and exemption of States such as New York, Alaska and other regions have already invested 7 and half a million dollars in 2008 and have invested up to 35 million dollars for 2009.
