In China and the region, two men ended their life with self-mord
Earlier, one of those who were pregnant has already been trying to suid.
On 30 October, approximately 1-00, in the village of Lugo, the man was born in 1947.
It is known that he had already committed an attempt to suid.
It's not that a man's moved in such a step.
On 31 October, 11-50, a 41-year-old man, Kinesma, had been inhabited by life.
No signs on the mortality have been detected, reporting the MO MVD press-service "Kineseman".
You got a black box in your car?
Until the American road designers are trying to find money for the reparation of the shift road systems, many begin to see a solution in a small black box that is correctly equipped on your car.
These devices followed by each passed car and transmitted this information to the officers are in the centre of the modernization of the anticipated system of America's car magazines, which were undertaken by Washington and the State's plans.
Normally, the nice planning area of car magazine has unexpectedly generated intensive debates and color allians.
Liberians have joined environmental groups to provide the Government's right to use small boxes to follow the number of miles you passed, and perhaps even where you're going, and then use this information when collecting tax accounts.
Moving the cheese in the shock.
The American Union of Civil Freedoms is also deeply peaceable and raised a number of issues of private life.
Although the convention can't be agreed, it can't continue or not, a few states are not going to wait.
They think about how they can go to the system in which the drivers will take every miles of the way they are going.
Thousands of cars have already been tested by these black boxes, part of which have a partnership.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the question we may have the right to choose,” said Hasan Ihratha, the Executive Director of the Association of South California Governments, which will prepare plans on the beginning of the follow-up of the state authorities of miles passed by each California car, until 2025.
It will be changed in how we will make these taxes.
There's already technology for this.
This requires the absence of funds in the Governing Fund for the construction of sex roads, which are accountable for taxes that the Americans will make on the car replacement.
Americans haven't buyed so much gas as before.
There are more miles to one gallon.
The federal tax, 18,4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Policy doesn't want to increase the tax even to one center at high gas prices.
"Bengine tax is simply not able to keep," said Le Mannich, a transport policy expert at Minnesota University.
Its state has recently been installed on the car of 500 follow-up devices for the testing of the wrong payment system.
"This will be the best alternative in the long-term perpetue," he said.
It is called the wrong user.
It is not surprised that this idea attaches citizen Liberals, since taxes can change the nature of poez to reduce the risk of the road and emission of the gases, for example.
Planned bodies in California are attached to this system in a time to achieve the objectives set out by the laws of this State on the fight against global warming.
However, a member of the palace of the representatives of Bill Shuster (resp, Pen·vania), the president of the Road Transport Committee, said that he also considers this system as the most long-term alternative.
The free market committees in the Reason Fund are also concerned that the drivers will be able to take each miles.
"This is not just a tax to go into the black roof," Edrian Moore, Vice-President on the Political Affairs, said.
People will be directly responsible for what they receive.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who invited the assembly to move in 2011 for a wrong payment.
The United States Senate adopted a pilot project for 90 million dollars in the past year, which would take part of about 10 000 cars.
However, the heads of the palace of the representatives rejected this proposal because of the threats of agricultural legislators representing electors who are often going a lot of miles in the world to reach or to the city.
A few states and cities, however, are going on this way in the same way.
The largest enthusiasm is shown in the State of Oregon, where 5000 leaders are attached to the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon take the state for miles of run in place of gas charge.
The pilot project in Nevada is already closed.
In New York, he's looking at it.
Illinois will test it on the basis of car rental.
A Coalition I-95, in which transport departments are 17 states of East-East (including Maryland, Pen-Vanania, Virginia and Florida), examines how they can do these changes.
This concept has not received a general recognition.
In Nevada, where approximately 50 cars of volunteers had recently been based on these devices, the drivers were convinced that the Government could follow each of their steps.
"The "great brother" and such things are a big problem," Alauddin Han said, "which addresses and manages effectiveness in the Nevada Transport Department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were completed, the American Union of Civil Freedoms in Nevada warned on its website: "They will be increasingly increasingly converted into the full-scale sequence.
There is no need to create a huge and weighty technological infrastructure, which will be unable to keep records on all-day movements of certain citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult searches are carried out in a delighted technology that would allow the authorities to take account of the cars passed by miles, but without information about the time and time.
If you can do that, Han said, the society will feel more calm.
Searching for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
This company was particularly not involved in the collection of State taxes.
She was trying to go out to the developing market of the type of auto-security, where the drivers would be running on the basis of a run.
But the devices that it tests have attached the way of designers because they do not use GPS and provide a periodic number of information threatened by the modem.
"The people will be more able to do this if you do not follow their speed and do not follow their position," said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
There were several big errors in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much less lovers and less reliable ways to do so.
The designers in the Orgon are experimenting with the providers of various options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely reject the device by determining instead to make a fixed collection based on the average number of miles that all the people of the state passed through.
In other places, it is hoped to sell the idea of the careful public by providing the devices to make more than less than less.
In New York, transport facilities are trying to deal with a taxable device that will also take a payment for parking accounts, provide "payments as you go" to the assurance and collect a bill of speed data in real time from other drivers, which the cars could also use to avoid tests.
“The automatics will contribute to the participation of the advantage they would propose”, states the gradual projection document.
The designers of transport systems, however, are concerned about whether I do not have any mistakes on the wrong payment only by a huge decline factor.
In the town transport Commission on the San Francisco valley, the officers say that the assembly could be very simple to overcome the confidential Fund for the construction of sex roads, taking taxes on the benzine.
An additional single or annual tax could be taken from hybrid car drivers and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of benzine to make their right part.
"No need for radical interactions when everything you need to do is to accept aspirin," Randy Rentscher, director of the Law-Accessibility Commission and Public Affairs, said.
If we do this, hundreds of million leaders will be concerned about their private life and the ability of other things.
The EU will prepare measures to support Ukraine for Russia's economic pressure
The Union has a reserve plan for Ukraine to ensure gas as well as to achieve an external credit agreement with the UFM if Russia will take any measures in response to the possible signature of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine on the Wilnius Samen.
The MVF is negotiated with standby credit, and another EU factor, directly involved in negotiations, has added that their aim is to conclude the agreement in the nearest time.
In addition to the potential credit from the U.S.U.U. can receive 610 million from the same union.
Analytics requested by Rayter doubt that Ukraine and MVF are able to overcome ancient differences on the conditions of dealing.
It does not believe the possibility of reforms for aid, and the international S&P rating agency, which was reduced on Friday to the Ukrainian summer review at one stage - to "B" with "V".
However, EU representatives say that the MVF can demonstrate deficiency under credit conditions, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
Furthermore, the EU's financial support plan is a reserve option to ensure Ukraine with gas, which is a part of its supply now and from Russia.
It may be gas from the North River or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to the rulers, is the most acceptable and most acceptable way if Russia is "isolated" Ukraine.
Analytics believe that such a way of reverse supply to Ukraine can be used only for several weeks and probably lead to decrease in other regions.
"Med EU countries and Ukraines are negotiated on how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added Reyter's source.
Russia outside the fight against the pollution of towns by cars
Strengthening to solve major urban transport problems was observed in most world megapolis from the second half of the XH century.
It was usually about their rehabilitation and enlargement of the magazine, or about the attempts to reduce the question on the cars, the number of cars and the time of their use.
A broad example of Singapore, where a severe quantity of private cars has been introduced, and the right of their acquisition is purchased on aids.
His price may exceed the price of the car itself two-three times.
Property of the towns, including London, have introduced a road in the center of the city.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgarte, the so-called green areas are included where only a vehicle is allowed with a certain ecoclass that also uses high quality fuel (including biocarbon or electricity).
The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 the "Pinty-year air plan" of approximately 250 billion Yuanians (environ 40 billion dollars).
As the "E" Director for Transport Reduction of the Municipal Environmental Protection of Pekina Li Quinshing said, the main objective of the five years is to reduce air pollutants to 20-35 per cent to 2017, the increase of private cars until the level of not exceeding 6 million (only 5,2 million) and the increase in 5 per cent of the use of fuel in one vehicle.
According to this agency, the car transport in Peking is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of general air pollution.
Including the main measures of the programme, the use of car transport and the introduction of additional taxes for auto-governmental authorities.
Furthermore, cities of "Green Five-year" includes the use of an older vehicle (including the creation of anticipated financial programmes of old car replacement in hybrid or electricity), the development of electricity (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
The number of car innovations in Pekina is also prohibited for all private cars to move at the fifth round (all in the CNA capital of six) one day a week (in the corresponding information contains the number of vehicles) and the issue of registration signs for cars based on lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of registers of private machines in Pekina was only third of the 2010 volume).
According to the programme " Environmental Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 138).
According to Min Natura, in 2011 the "previsible sources" were 41 per cent of all emissions in the city's atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, the emissions from the car are ten times higher than the industry, and in Sankt Peterburg are nine times.
In the RF, they are still starting to think about the possibilities of car management in the towns.
The Director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy of the U.S.A. Michail Blinkin considers the administrative and physical measures aimed at enhancing the request on the car, which is not aware that they can be adopted by the society only in the case of their fullest university.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its car park, where two classes are sensitive to any regulatory effect - the workers and the staff of the car, as well as the "private" users, whose total number is at least 200 thousand (approximately 5 per cent of the total number of Moscow autopark).
In the days of the ECOM center, the Urbanists prepared an investigation in which an analysis of the city territory balance between resident building, road covering and transport quantities is analysed.
Basic results of researchers: The centre of the city provides roads in two times less than required, and most of the cars in the centre do not use the cars every day, remaining on a long time on the parking or just on the e.g.
Consequently, it is not to build parkings, but to expand the car stocks, but to reduce the transitional part (in order to make the streets more friendly to travel), as well as to use and location of personal transport within the territories of the history centre (a total of approximately 3212 g areas covering a number of center areas of the city).
Traffic for non-sencionated trade in Vollogda will grow in time
According to urban authorities, the increase in the sizes of the traps will help to set a range in Vollogda and free the streets from natural palaces and bottles.
Most customers do not have taxes, the production they have made, often is not a corresponding health control.
And that means that the health of a hostile is threatened.
Yes, the lower range of profit for citizens for non-sensioned trade from November increases six times from 500 rubles to 3000, reporting the press-service of the Wologa Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the main economic growth driver in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily the crisis of non-payment for unrequired consumer credits and mass reductions.
Our main concern now is not that growth has been disturbed, but the structure of this growth.
Recently, he has been completely entitled to consumption that almost doesn't make trades," said the main Goldman Sachs economy in Russia Clemens Grafe, representing a quarter report on Russian economy.
Now the nominal payment increase in Russia is about 10 per cent.
Inflation in 6%, he will be able to ensure the future consumer question at the current level, expected by Goldman Sachs.
But the rental of the Russian companies is falling, so they will, mostly, take care of the optimization of staff costs.
Today, we see the growth of the payment in the PIB: if the payment is 10 per cent, the PIB is only 2 per cent, explained by Mr. Grafe.
Companys were decreased by the reduction of rentability.
If it doesn't grow, it can lead to freedom and growth.
No payment of Russian business can not be taken, commented by the Main Economy Barclays Capital in Russia and the SNG Vladimir Pantushin.
Without historical minims, the competition for the staff is high.
In order to overcome or maintain the current employees, payments should be taken by the employees.
The need for subder in Russia is also a very rapid growth of use.
Mr. Graffe considers that this type of credit is not due to extremely high rates for consumer's multiplying effect on the country's economy.
"We haven't seen the benefits for the economy from the growth of consumption, the money is not divided by the economy, but are returned to the same banks in the form of percentages," said the economy.
But the problem in another -- in Goldman Sachs, is expecting an increase in unrequired credits.
They will primarily take non-profit people who have nothing to provide for them.
Assessments are high.
As a result, they are not often returning," said Mr. Graffe.
Therefore, the second threat of economic growth in Russia is the non-payment crisis.
The U.S. Basiley Slowk's Director of the Bank's Institute has already seen the signs of the emergency bank crisis.
Small credit organisations, without access to the resources of the masters, have been required to attraction the resources of the population under higher percentages.
In response to the group of wars, the masters went out and began to decrease credit rates - the economicist continues.
Small credit organisations can't give interests under the same percentage, otherwise they'll have negative percentage margins.
If the gentlemen do not reject demping, Russia threatens the valuable bank crisis, the Basiley Slowk.
A number of bank licences in the last weeks of economicists considers the proclaimer of mass pain.
"The only gentlemen will not have such a situation: the system of contributions has not been considered to the system crisis," warns the head of the Institute.
But the growth of consumption will also be deteriorated without a non-payment crisis, and they believe in the investment bank, because they refused the index of ladies and military payments based on the current version of the budget.
A part of consumption attack will be mixed by natural monopol tariffs (and, as a result, reducing inflation).
But only partly: if investment is not grown (and the preference to this is not yet aid), the growth of consumption will still be disturbed, confidently in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin from Barclays Capital has not yet seen the advantage of the pessimist scenarios.
"The main risk is the still falling in the price of oil," he says.
Following its assessment, the Russian economy will begin to reduce the value of nitrogen under 90 dollars/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the BC could not be able to reduce the rate of rate in the economy.
It is observed that the inflation was decreased, and the banks began to raise taxes.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that declared the transition to the inflation tariff," said Clemens Grafe.
The percentage of the Bank's market rates does not affect, but only affects interbank credit rates.
"For the CB it's the end of all hopes," evaluated Clemence Grafe.
The money received on CB aids are not used to credit the economy but to manage their liquidity
As long as the tax is reduced, the currency changes the currency, it means that the funds are trying to avoid speculating against the rubble.
"CB will be able to realize that this is not working," Mr. Graffe said and once he said that the State planned to put the rubble into the "free floor" until the end of 2015.
But it's supposed to do it before, or to raise the key BC (5.5 per cent), he believes.
According to his assessment, the rabber course is now experienced by 10 per cent.
I'm just running one road, that's what the expert's outcome.
But if the NCB is injured in the midst of doubt that the liquidation of the currency is not a part of the rubble weapons policy, it can reduce the rubble much more.
In Chelabinska, the second combustion of the peoples of South Ural passed.
Forum is advised to the Day of Population, the 400-year restoration of the Russian State and the 20-year adoption of the Russian Constitution.
In the neighbourhood, delegations from all cities and areas, representatives of national-cultural unions, religious conferences, legal and executive authorities have participated in a total of approximately 350 people.
Curs ́for' is aimed at strengthening the international agreement.
Here we can show an example not only to other regions but also to other countries.
We have no differences and divergences.
"We live in full understanding," says Feo, "mitropolated Chelabinski and Zlatoustowski.
A number of issues were discussed at the meeting, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
After that, the neighbours adopted a resolution.
The neophoral part of the forum continued in the theater of oper and ballet.
There have been opened the exhibition of national-cultural units in the Chelabin area.
Snowden ready to cooperate with Germany in the issue of the United States investigation
Edward Snowden, the United States investigator, stated that he was ready to go to Berlin to witness to the German Parliament, if the United States National Security Agency and his director Kit Alexander were not able to answer questions about its activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Christ Streobele met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was delivered a refuge to discuss his witnesses in Germany.
In the letter of Mr. Snowden, who deputated the MMI in Berlin on Friday, stated: “Although the results of my efforts were clearly local, my Government continues to do something different as to change and is trying to criminalize political statements by voting accusations without any protection.”
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to reject voting commitments against it.
The accusations submitted by the United States Justice Minister included spionage and furnishment of public property.
Hans-Peter Fridrich, Minister for the Internal Affairs of Germany, reported the Time Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officers, we will find ways to do so."
The relations between the United States and Germany have been pressured after the fact that the NCB had been listening to the phone of the Officer of the Angels Mercel.
Thomas Opperman, deputy, who is headed by a parliamentary group who is a curing communication, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without undertaking his dangers and not being completely distorted from the United States", it should be used.
Mr. Schroebel, deputate of the parliament from the Green German party, described his description with Mr. Snowden in its Twi.
During his visit to Russia, he was conducted by two German journalists.
Mr. Schroebele said that Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he had gone.
If Mr. Snowden had given witnesses in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there “in safe”, the deputate said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had been with the "great and continuous" persecution campaign, which urged him to leave his house.
However, he said that he had been encouraging in the world's reaction to his "political statements".
Citizens throughout the world and high-leaving factors, including in the United States, have covered the disturbance of an uncontrolled system of integral coverage for society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.
Frontier Airlines will take a hand-place
Frontier Airlines plans to take from passengers up to $100 because they carry their hands on their road.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up $100 for a hand and $2 for a coffee or gas, although their statement in the middle of the airlines claimed that passengers would be able to leave the whole bank.
The new payment for the handplace is extended to the stocks in the baggage areas, so the small amounts set under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said that he would take $25 if the collection was paid before, and $100, if the travelers were going to make it just when they were going out.
Frontier Cate O'Mellly said that the payment of $100 had to make the passengers care about payment before.
"We don't want to take it for it," she said.
Aviation companies began to take the first and second baggage in 2008.
Passovers trying to escape these assemblies are buying as much as figs, in the hands of the baggage areas, which often do not have enough places in these areas.
The congregations are one of the ways to make passengers less to the board.
O'Mellly said that this new collection isn't actually for money.
The fact is that the most loyal clients of Frontier state that the finding of a place in the baggage areas is more difficult.
Passeers who purchased the tickets on the aircraft site will not be required.
This means that one passenger at the outcome of the Frontier road can be able to carry out free, while the passporter can pay $100 for the same sum.
O'Melley said that the change of procedures on the website and on the staff of the Frontier registration was called to ensure that passengers would know about the collection before they would come out of the station.
The new Frontier collection will not begin to take before the aerodrome, even though the date is not set up yet.
Passovers often complain about the baggage and other assemblies, but the aircraft firms love them.
They claim that the baggage is worth money, and the passengers who need this service must be for it.
Many in Wall Street consider the addition of baggage collections as a sign that the aircraft is taking enough money to cover the aircraft rents after several years of aeroplane.
Yet, most of them were not packing the assemblies for hands.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for three years ago, and another Allgiant Air dealer followed her example later.
The only other aviation company with this collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said Jay Sorenssen Aviation Advisor, who carefully follows additional collections.
After its evaluation in the report from December 2011, the assembly for hands offers Spirit $50 million per year.
Sorenssen, the former tool manager Midwest Airlines, was recently flying by the Spirit travel, and he was interesting that he would find out when the passengers met with an unusual spirit collection in the handsite.
He said, "The process of labour was the worst of what I saw for my career in the aviation company."
I expected to see the teeth cross and the outcome of a drag on the station.
He said, “And the plane has passed straight.”
Frontier also followed by Spirit with respect to $2 for coffee, tea, gasing or sugar.
Frontier stated that passengers receiving gas or sugar can leave all the bank and that the cafe café lift will be provided freely.
She's still going to split water free.
US Airways tried to take a drink in 2008, but from that after seven months after the passengers began to complain, and no other major aviation company followed her example.
The Frontier's initiative to take for hands when passengers do not buy a bilingue directly in the aircraft, it is following a measure to take customers on their website.
Aviation companies are online sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sale ticket.
This has encouraged all aircraft companies to encourage passengers to buy billets in their places, not to turn to the online agency.
Frontier, however, went further in this area.
In September, she began to give two times less bonus miles of flight passengers to customers who bought billets through the online tourist agency.
In the middle, it cut the mile to 25 per cent of the mile of the train.
Yes, the 1000 miles from the Frontier acquired by the online tourist of the Agency would be allowed to get 250 miles.
Moreover, passengers can choose a place before, only if they purchase a ticket directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal customers in Denver's home city, but her business is reduced and becomes increasing.
The exhibition was decreased by 9 per cent, and the annual opportunities were reduced by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, the financial outcomes of the Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct the Frontier within the sale of a flying company.
NCB is guilty of internal error, not of hackers in the interruption of the site
The Occurrent Secret Agency of the National Security Agency stated on Friday evening that the interruption of their website for a few hours was a technical fight, not a hacker, as was stated in the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight because of the internal error occurred during the planning update”, reported the investigation agency in the Official E-mail.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The statement that the crime in 日 was determined by a determined attack of the type of “release in service” [DDoS] is invalid.
The network monitoring systems of servers have been registered earlier today that the NB site was not working for at least six hours, and the site is still not available for some users.
ABC News reported earlier that the internal secret network of the Agency was broken.
No secret information is in danger, reported by the representative.
At least one online group of hackers claimed that it was responsible for the outcome of the NBB site with DDOS attack.
The DDOS attacks are decreased so that the target site is traficked until the servers are surrounded and the site is out of the building.
Hacker tactics are simple, and attacks are not intended to enter the internal target system.
The previous secret NCB, which had ever received the "Not Such Agency", has occurred in the past months in the center of public attention and criticism after the opening of its extensive programmes of remote and inside of the country, all this is the reaction to the secrets of the NCB stolen by the Agency and the disappointed by the former NCB Edward Snowden.
The growing area around the Agency has so much expressed that today's incident was the result of the targeted hackers.
The arrival of Bombardier is decreased with the fall of the aircraft and the number of orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft manufacturer, reported on Thursday to reduce clean arrival to 15 per cent under the effect of reduced number of orders and supplies in the third quarter and the problem of contracts in its railway-related division.
The Bombardier company in Montreal had also not listed any data on the aerodrome of its newest CSeries aircraft and not for new information on whether the plans for the introduction of the aircraft will be implemented to the commercial exploitation of September.
After the first flight of the aircraft experienced model, which was about half months ago, he was only three times planning, asking questions about whether the graphic trial stage.
The results did not correct the prognoses and led to the fall of action more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Foundation.
Cameroon Doerxen, the National Bank Financial analytic, reduced its rubber on Thursday from the "over midnight" to the "middle-night" because of the conviction that the growth of action is in the nearest quarter or two.
“The reduction of the amount of aircraft supply was totally predicted, we have certainly been disappointed by the transport indicators”, said Doerxen in the consideration of the fund market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as long as the programme continues.
However, if new orders are not declared in the next months, we assume that the market will be more sceptic to the programme.
Bombardier's company hopes that CSeries' family will allow her to take place in the lower price of the market where Boeing and Airbus are now located.
The first experienced model of the aircraft was presented in March, and the first time the flight was made in September after several months of delay.
However, the CSeries firm orders are not too much than 177, since the purchasers are expecting the results of the annual experiences to check the company's fuel efficiency and the potential economicity of the new layer.
There are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
The Main Executive Director Pier Boduan was sure that Bombardier would take its goal to 300 firm orders until the first flight will be launched in the commercial exploitation.
On Thursday, the analysers and the MMI also assured that the programme would be moved on the basis of the plan.
“The air test model was not longer on the earth than expected,” Boduan said during the phone conference, adding that the planning of the planning planning for the simple aircraft and renewal of software has been planned during the simple aircraft.
All manufacturers are planning tests differently.
We decided to carry out the first flight and break up the update, so we did.
This will happen during the whole programme of age trials.
The second of the five test patterns must fly in the next week, and all the rest of them will follow him as the company reported.
However, the analyses are strictly related to the statement that the first client would be able to access the CSeries aircraft operation within 12 months after its first flight.
The Bombardier company stated that it evaluated the time of introduction in the exploitation and would provide new information for several months.
"There is a long time of aerous experiences - even though it is visible and corresponds to the internal graph of Bombardier - supports the point of view that the introduction into the exploitation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerxen.
In the third quarter, on 30 September, the clean income of Bombardier was reduced to $147 million, or 8 cents per action, with $172 million, or 9 cents per action last year.
The corrected arrival to the action remained 9 cents older.
The lower income was not significantly reduced from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analytics expected the arrival of 10 cents for an action and the valuable income of $4,56 billion, Thomson Re日s I/B/E/S.
The fourth in the world on the plane manufacturer reported that he was at 45 aircraft courts for a quarter of less than 57 years ago.
The total number of orders falled from 83 to 26 aircrafts.
The portfolio of the airport with $32.9 billion per September 30, without changing from 31 December.
"In the field of airports, the results were in line with our goals, but a small number of commitments and the common market conditions became an inappropriate factor," said Boduan.
The aircraft income has fallen by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest feed producer in the world, reported that the wheel income in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent — up to $2,1 billion.
A portfolio in transport division with $32.6 billion per September 30, which is a little above the indicator from 31 December.
The income of the transport department has been negatively affected with the implementation of several major contracts.
Ru said that in the fourth quarter, a new development plan would be presented.
Bombardier's action, which also declared that the main financial director of the corporation of Google Patrick Pichet ́s in the Directors' Board, has 8.5 per cent – to S$4.83 on the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third in the world of a commercial aircraft producer and the closer competitor of Bombardier, reported on Thursday that the quarter income would be reduced by 10 per cent.
Sony calculates the lower annual arrival
The Japanese electronic manufacturer, Sony's corporation, completed the past quarter with a pure rent of 19.3 billion yen, or 197 million dollars, reduced the prognoses for the current financial year.
The results of Sony from July to September 2013 were more comforting than expected by the question of the Japanese production computers to be asked on television, video cameras and personal.
The Television Business Sony, in the II quarter of the first three-year operational arrival of 5,2 billion yen, again falled up to 9,3 billion billion in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronic market takes difficult time, especially because the television question is reduced.
And while the competitors are trying to find out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main co-operators of Sony, Panasonic corporation, recently summarizes accents on industrial computers: the sales of companies will be high temperatures, especially because of car systems and environmentally clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year, which will be ended in March 2014, Sony considers that 179 billion billion billion of operations have arrived against those expected before 230 billion yen.
Thoomson Re日s said that the analysis assumed that the indicator would be significantly above and represent 221 billion yen.
In trying to get out of the crisis, Sony expands the product line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of "smart" hours from the Japanese corporation was announced, which would allow to be released from the need for 100 times a day from the smartphone.
After Sony had decreased the annual predict on arrival and release, the operations to Tokyo tomorrow lost more than 11 per cent in the price, laying down to the level of 1668 and one action.
Gentleman was a Synaps education stimulator
Scientists from the University of John Hopkins and the Medical School of Mount Sinai found a white, using Foxp2's "general" function, stimulating the education of new relationships between neurons.
The study was reported in Science, and its short content can be read on the journal site.
Gen Foxp2 is the first gene, which is the function of the function with the Âa.
Its role was made in 2001 by discovering a family of several persons who could not speak correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
The scientists discovered that the family members had been forced to work with the Foxp2 gene, but how he performed his function, it remained unfair.
In the new biolog study, at least part of its functions, Foxp2 is a stimulator for the education of new synaps in the brain area, with the forming of things.
It's about it, thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The last was found by searching for factors that stimulate synaps education.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, and Foxp2 was only for its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 actually affects oxygen, the scientists have confirmed the muscle experiment.
When the gene was experiencedly reduced by animal activity, they cried less when divorced with their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of sounds was also restored.
Before the mouse was also shown in relation to Foxp2's oxygenation.
Lives introduced by a gene copy were more active and less frequency than normal mouse.
Until these couples, however, scientists don't know whether the Foxp2 work is and, accordingly, the SRPX2 controlled with clean "mechanical" characteristics of audio education or more tone processes.
A Cocain Dependence Justice, which warned the Chairman of the Crime Group on Police Research
42-year Basharat Ditta has provided information to the criminal authority of Nilu Scarboro
The lawyer feared that his secret drug dependence would be discovered
It was sentenced by the King Court of Liverpool for three years.
The prestigious one, which reported to the drug on the major police investigation, because he was afraid of disturbing his secret drug dependence, was locked for three years.
The 42-year Basharat Diet transmitted to the criminal authority of Nilu Scarboro secret information on the investigation of his activities on illegal drug trafficking after it had been threatened because of its cocain dependence.
A lawyer who received the call of Bash and called among criminals "Crash" was arrested at home in 2011 after the police office for Scarboro, which he had previously represented in the court of drugs.
The officers noted that 32-year Scarboro left three packages with cocain in the town of Blackbern of the Lancashire, until he was at the dinner of a lawyer association with colleagues.
The consequences showed that Ditta “regulated” drugs of class A, after the tests showed the tracks of cocaine in his hair, his papers and credit cards.
During eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information on the arrests of two persons on the order of Scarboro and one of his members.
All four suspicious were at that time under the monitoring of the police in the framework of a major investigation of the crime organization on the emergency of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Mercisade, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
More than 32 people were closed after the police had spent heroin and cocaine in a range of £1,5 million and more than $200,000.
The 42-year-old Ditta reported information to criminals because of fear that his cocain dependence would be discovered.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Diot, who works in the court of Forbes Solicitors, which is located in Blackberne, has been covered by an offence after his recognition of his fault in two cases of derogation by the court on the three-week court in the Court of Liverpool.
He recognised the conservation of cocaine at one of the previous trial meetings.
The judge's divorce occurred after the police investigating Scarboro's activity discovered that he regularly spoke with Ditta on the phone from February 2011.
Two children followed the suspicious and discovered how he arrived to the house of Dith in Blackberne and placed drugs in a 60-percent cleanness in a black cup for golf under the murder boxes of the jurist.
In the course of the transfer of Scarboro, he was multi-fold contacted with Ditta, who was at the football station of Ivud Park by the Blackburn Rovers team.
The judge returned home after drugs; there were nine.
The Court recognized that Ditta had “regulated” cocaine after the tests found the tracks of the drugs of class A in his hairs, hairs and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but he refused to use cocaine, said he spoke to a suspicious diler because he was his customer, and insisted that their communication constitutes a "advocate secret".
During his detention, Ditta took his paper and tried to extract several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he had also taken a wheel model.
At the police question, he said that he had a house office and customers at his home on legal matters.
However, the Court was agreed that after important arrests, he called the major parts of the illegal trafficking of drugs that he had previously represented in the court to tell them what the children know about them.
In Anne White's accusation, he said, "If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, it is for the matters of vote."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misuse of its position on votes, since he has entered too close with certain customers.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug trader, but a drug operator who has a drug in his own own.
Of course, it will be legal because he was theirs.
However, this has exceeded significantly the limits of ordinary and customer.
He prevented police investigation as much as possible in order to allow this person to continue his crime activity.
Mr. Ditta wasn't reading his profession, but he's kidnapped her.
He was too close to certain customers, especially Scarboro, and allowed to doubt his independence.
Ditta didn't recognize the fault and said, "If I was corrupted by the one I didn't do, and I would like to give Mr. Scarboro information, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, I would do it immediately."
But after the meeting of the senior officer Le Holsted from the police of Lancashira, he stated: “Mr. Ditta has been converted from the voting acts to a vote criminal as soon as it began to obtain drugs from the representatives of the organized crime.”
The cocaine's attractiveness has made it unexpectedly complicated and vulnerable for the main criminal groups, which ordered him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
The lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and give the society confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta gave this confidence and tried to cover his profession.
The investigation on Mr. Ditta has made a department of Lancashira on the dangerous organized crime, which has already been sentenced to him on three cases of cocaine conservation, and now on the contrary to justice, demonstrating our desire to obtain a righteous penalty for criminals.
Let this matter serve as a warning for criminals that no one is outside the law.
We will find you and take the responsibility of the judiciary.
Sam Scarboro was sentenced for 14 years after the recognition of his fault in negotiation with the purpose of supply of heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 persons, involved in the mixture, were sentenced to 153 years for crimes with drugs.
On his website, Ditta organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers that he said that the work of his minds is the one who represents the customers with a rational sentence in America, the ideal company for him in the dinner, Mohammed Ali, and the motivation in the Âe is an inequality.

The number of objects is reported, but the quality of transplants is often deteriorated.
The criteria of the expert must be two: the first is the reduction of the time of transmission, the second is enjoyment.
Before all, the possibility is to change the type of transport without getting out of the rain.
In Moscow, however, the TIA is at the same time in turn.
A light example of the ADN.
Previous buses from the Jaroslavian Chess at the screen before the main entrance in the NCB.
Their residences have now been transferred to the opposite side of Jaroslovakia to the Cosmonavian Street.
Further than metro, significantly far away from the monarch, so closer to the homes.
The gift that the people did not want the carvoxal under the windows and claimed all the institutions.
The capitalists in Moscow haven't done any conflict.
The first of them began to build five years ago at the Planner's metro.
The project was called to be a model.
And it was actually made a pattern of the transplanted host for the redemption of investors to a banal trade center.
No, there's perrons for buss, so that they don't go from the metro under the rain, and three stage of the cars.
True, the chemical trolleabus No.202 and No203 in the Moscow TIP place did not have the principle.
They've been thrown away from the metro.
So there's been more places under trade.
Only a clothes of 32 magazine, and there are almost everything from zoots to the car.
Well, actually, who of the bus passengers will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TU, we always get a trade center.
The situation has recently reached its final log when the part of the carriers decided to market.
Now on the third stage of the "Planer" TCP among the parking areas and the fighting trade.
Sights, speeds, Chinese Genes, Nerusian knifes, and protectors, who are badly looking at our graph.
The cross-seed host became a baser.
The thing is that the Planner's metro was a market before, but it was thrown up.
And in the prefecture of trademakers, they were welcomed and laid on the overcast park of the cross-border host.
Still because of high prices there is always empty.
It's the most funny that the market's down for building a new aircraft TV on it.
That's a rockery.
The metro of the Caluge race was 50 meters from the newbuild meter to the bus, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of a trade center, like TIA, the race increased up to 170 metres.
To sit in the bus, we need to go through the whole trade center.
After 22 hours, when he's closed, he's going to run him under the open sky.
Instead, the "Planer" and the "Caluge" will soon be shown by flowers.
Meanwhile, in September, the Middle-Agricultural Commission adopted planning decisions for the first eight capitals of the TCPs.
Four of them will be 25 feet without considering two or three underground jaws.
The main monster will grow in the Tushino metro, there will be 418.70,000 kilometers of the area.
The representatives of the RVD railway wallets responsible for the TWU building at metro have already told journalists: stores, hotels and apartments have been distributed in the future multiple stages.
In this case, the factors assured that the multi-virus parkings have a mute from the third to the half of the area.
Let's take for example the "national" garages.
Let us say, the garage of 258 machines, which recently built on the International Street, has a range of 8015 kilometers.
So, for the parking of 2,6 thousand cars at Petrovsko-Razomski, 80,000 "quadrates".
It's less than the third of the machine they're going to build there.
Let the one-day stage go to the bus stage.
It remains at least 150 thousand kilometers of commercial inevitability.
And this, for a minute, is nearly two gums.
If the TPU capital is built by railways and oxygens, the rest of the metropolitans will be enhanced.
They also promised that there would be a lot of " functional assignment objects", including guests, offices and even sports.
Instead, in the Moscow city's property department, the journalists have recently reported that they are developing a project of establishment that investors have to be able to take part in the TIP to the stakeholders.
No competition.
Because I prayed that transport issues for the city are priorities.
The ideal TU is, for example, the Harvard in Boston or "Spayne" in Toronto, sure Alexander Morozov.
Trollevebus and tramways fall down under the ground at the level of metro and race of the metro weight to the tramway is only 50 meters without going out on the street.
There's no rare trade around.
But the Moscow chiefs are throwing out.
Or we're not going to build anything or we'll have 25 stages with offices and apartments.
Esther will compare to the extremism of the patriotic feelings
For the legal protection of the patriotic senses of citizens against Russia's provokations and the "Russian Justice" responsibilities, it will be compared to the adjustment of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish it for five years.
As reported by the Newspaper, such amendments to the Legality prepared forward by the Energy Committee on the Michew Oleg, are already intended to be concluded in the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendment to understand the emotional relationship with a citizen who is a citizen whose love for this country is responsible for its judgment, respect for his history and culture.
As Micheas indicates, in the patriarch law there are sanctions for the consequence of the formal characteristics of the State authority - flag and herb.
In addition, as the parliamentary opinion, the protection of the Russian whose feelings may be taken to the public symbols and other manifestations of disrespect to our country, there is not enough in the Russian legislation on the matter.
As an example, he leads to the rounds every year to the Day of Conquerment of Discussion when some medical staff allow themselves to doubt the heroic movement of the SSR people in combating fascists.
The Chapter of the National Party - The Day of Victory of May 9 - has been distorted annually.
In exercising the astroum and the "alternative view" of the history, some publicists are thinking that, desirablely, the Cultural Germans did not have a wild Soviet Union!
I believe that this is absolutely unfair in the country where the city of history remains the main "the spirit force" of the nation, "Oleg Michew.
In addition, Micah said that patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law claims that the feelings of those who believe and that patriotic feelings can be practically unpunished.
According to the people ' s opinion, it is necessary to compare patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to translate the relevant penalty in Article 282 of the Code.
The draft legislation provides a penalty for patriotic feelings: from 100 months to five-year-old conclusions.
The Earth was held on Thursday, 31 October, in the Coquimbo region in the central part of Chile, and the Agency was transferred to Re représentants.

Dmitriy Medvedev: Greenpeace's case will be considered justly
Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev reported on Friday that Greenpeace's activists would be considered in strike with Russian law.
France may not be doubted that the consideration of the matter will be carried out in accordance with the law of the law, and we hear all suspiciousness.
"We can guarantee the follow-up of laws," said Dmitry Medvedev at the meeting with the Premier Minister of France Jean-Marke Ero.
In the middle of the detained Greenpeace activists, there is a citizen of France.
Pieru Pizanya, as well as other activists, has been pronounced accusations of irregularity.
"I asked if we could wait for humanitarian greed against a detained citizen," he cites Mr. Ero.
"Our country cannot support the activities that may cause environmental damage, no one can violate the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said in his order.
His statement, the activities of any structure that are trying to affect technically complex and insecure processes, including energy supply, are dangerous.
He highlighted that these objects were "as a raw boat" and on what was happening in the Mea Cana Island, "Ria News".
The United Nations declares new objectives for the transfer of poverty
The United Nations should immediately access to the new completion of tasks to replace the Millennium Development goals, which have been formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
The Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of the "dual development targets" for the change of the CCT, which expires in 2015, until the United Nations sustenance development Sammy beginning in Rio de Janeiro at night.
They were included in a final document, which will sign world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the same time.
The Secretary-General of the UN Pan Gi Moon said to the parties of Sammith at night that now the time has come to “be above national interests”.
“I am glad that the United Nations Member States agreed to launch and take the process of establishing universal objectives for sustainable development,” he said.
These CURs will face our progress in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and they will become an increasing part of the development concept for the period after 2015.
I will apply all efforts to use the powers granted to me by Member States to enhance our view of sustainable development objectives that are addressed to the successful implementation of the CRT.
The security in Mozambique increased by the conflict of influential people
Under the top of the statue of Samarie Mashel, the president of Mozambique, thousands of people were gathered in the centre of Maputa to scan the world's lozing on one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace return; we want stability," Vanessa de Susa said, the Executive Director of the Investment Company.
In danger of the future of her country, she changed the business costume on the football, which was elected by the "We need security" in Portuguese, and joined the multitude on the Stage of Independence on Thursday.
During two weeks, the annual reports on the conflicts between Governing Armies and Renamo were one of the worst stakes since the conclusion of the confusion more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was sometimes a resurrected movement supported by the white authorities of Rodesia, and then by the Government of the Southern Apartment Epoch in the efforts to destabilise the independent Government of the country.
After 1992, it became a opposition party.
Analytics believe that the country is still going back to a full-scale conflict, but the recent events have made foreign investors and residents deteriorate.
High levels for fast growing economy, since the opening of great gas-shelf stocks and the north-western high-western areas can be more than $50 billion as investment in several years of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The Governing Party of Frelimo, leading political power since 1975, and the Renamo party accused one another in the created pressure.
The Partie Renamo approves that the Government has become the finalist of the last conclusions, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional retribution of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the rebels would then be spread when the Governing Army attacks of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the leader of the group, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazango, representative of Renamo.
The Government is guilty of Renamo's initiation of commitments, accusing the party to attack soldiers.
The President of Armanda, the Gabuz, tried to develop threats on instability.
Gebusa stated the AFP, the French In-Education Agency, in the middle that Mr. Dhlakama felt a "incapacity" and used "all that remained from its force to try to prove that he could make his own decisions to the Government."
Like Frelimo and Renamo are insisting that wars want to escape.
However, the threats were increased after the report that Mazanga had stated that Renamo was refused to reject the peaceful agreement of 1992.
He reported the Financial Times that he intended not to comply with the Party of Frelimo.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all the seriousness," said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between parties have been made little to reduce the pressure that strengthened the series of consequences this year.
"These are two powerful men (Gebus and Dhlahama) who are bound by the lumbs," Joseph Hanlon, the teacher of the Open University and the expert in Mozambique.
No one of them is a good negotiator, nor is any of them ready to go to the attacks.
The Partie of Renamo, who is trying to achieve election reforms, has already stated that it would boat the municipality of the elections appointed for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for a year.
The commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt to get income and financial bonuses from the Government.
The part of the votes for Renamo is decreased since 1992, while the new party — the Democratic Motion of Mozambique (MDM), which, as expected, will improve its indicators on these elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Gabuza, who should go away from the year when his second time is finished, wants to deal with democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multipartial democracy, he doesn't want transparency choices, he doesn't want peace because he does not want to leave the President's post," said Mazanga.
Not clearly, how Renamo can be able, but she has already discussed and stressed the attacks on police parties and the key cars leading from the north to the south.
Most of the sticks were located in the province of Sophala, which is in several hundreds of kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Bairu, the port of the bowling company, including Rio Tinto and Vale, is used to export the angle.
In June, Rio stopped the use of railway roads about a week after Renamo threatened the attack on the railway.
Mazanga was inclined when they asked him whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Partie of Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the activities in Mozambique were not very good," said Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the government's deficiency, and many people also concern corruption, long development and recently involved defense, says Fernando Lima, head of independent Mediacoop media company.
“The people think that the responsibility for the future country is to be taken by the Government and the President who must also find the solution of these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultuan, a demonstration party, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to restore the world, they want free access to the ways," he said.
A series of premier films " Arth-Minster" in Moscow
The series of films "Art-Mainstrum", where the lookers have seen one Russian and four incaused films in a few days before they go to the procate, prohibition in the Rolan film theater from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA "Novacy" with the project organizers.
Opens the French Regisher and Reim Carrici's actor's "Parys of any price" program.
This is a story of the worker in the French table of the model Maye (solo Carichi) which is deported to the family - to Marokko because of a vize problem.

Children should consider myths and ends as “the model of life”, says the author.
The statements about Torah could show that “the gross force cannot win the deeply heavyness” and that the Ends of the King of Artura are important to have a mind.
As many myths are being “too wild, too scandal, and in some cases too inappropriate for school education”, Crossley-Holand is a ‘covering election’ for the age of texts.
"I think it's wonderful that I'm a part of education in America," he said.
I expressed their introduction into the twenty-year education programme.
He added that the "three moralization" of the authors and teachers "seems interest" for children, and the main ideas are "complimented" in historical stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from English-Saxon, as well as wrote "The Norway Myths Congregation" for Penguin and the British People's Stories," said, "You may certainly have a ambition, but you better keep them at your own."
Perhaps the great difference between adult authors, and adult authors, who write for children, is needed to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy end, but it is necessary for a long time to understand good and good.
And this must be supplied; it is discovered through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle is to show, not to tell.

Vitalius Mutco: Waterhouse?
I think we've been back for 15 years ago.
The Ministry of Vitalie Mutko expressed his opinion on the destruction of the tribes during the Court of Ruses of Shinnik, Spartak.
I am a member of the response to all this: clubs, liga, RFS.
But we see they've taken a strict position.
They're waiting for someone from the side and to order.

Siberia shouldn't be a vegan: a warm tomatic will not replace the sugar
Why vegetarian is not suitable for life in Siberia, the RIA News Correspondent explained.
People who rejected the products of animal origin must not live in Siberia.
The winter will not be transferred here without a loss of health, and no heavy polymers will compensate them, considering the demanded Penalty of New Siberian Diologs and doctors.
Drink oil with litres
Increasing vegetarianity, not only meat and fish, but also milk, milk, eggs become a modest way of life.
However, the doctors of Diotologists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, there are a serious food standards, such as at least, not for health.
The full refusal of animal products is.
Animal whites contain an imminent aminocil, which is very difficult to compensate.
We need to include in the ration at least milk or egg," is the sure diotheolog Marina Bogai.
It provides for example a fish containing an immediate green acid of Omega-3.
The richest oil they have is linched.
"In order to need it for human quantities, you need to drink litres!", says the diotheolog.
The doctors are convinced that the inhabitants of Siberia must give rational attention to the winter.
In this season, vegetarian is particularly concerned.
In our terms, high food requirements are provided.
To do so, it needs a higher calorie.
"If a person is going to be on animal products, he does not have this calorie," says the specialist.
This is the doctor of Olga Posnak.
It adds that transport fruits and fibres are no outcome.
It is better for humans to eat pre-products produced in the region of living or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed for the best use and recycling of these products.
And the winter people do not want to whistle, but the bitter sugar or something more seat," explains the doctor's position.
According to her words, there may be vegetables, which are actually different, crowns, bobs, fruits, eggs remaining in winter, frozen oil.
But this is not enough for full-valued food.
According to the doctor-gastroenterologist of Claudia Arifolina, the vitamin levels are sufficient only from the middle of August to September.
The full transition to vegetarian in our natural conditions, when temperature can be changed to 30 degrees and the snow is increasing.
Organism needs energy for life, and this is primarily the harvest," is the medication.
Doctors note that the vegan is especially → for children and nurses.
Children, they need a building material, including an aminocyl.
And keeping veteranity, we give them unworthy.
It also needs a higher content of bea, vitamins and microelements in the menu.
"They do not receive any of them," it is God's sure.
Arifolin says that an adult is willing to choose everything he wants to play in the games that he wants.
He's already made a body, a squelet, a bodies.
Yet, children need to eat fully.
If parents only have some micro-elements or aminocyl, choosing what he's going to eat, it's just a violation of the child's rights.
"The lack of those or other things for the development of the brain, the view, the bones you will not restore tomorrow," she says.
All requested medical specialists are in view of the low quality of winter growing in the heat and transport fruit and fibres.
It contains less quantities of micro-elements that we have to be brought to us than in the open foundation.
"The quality of products is not that," says God.
Arifolin also notes that transport and heavy fruits and fibres are far away from ideal standards.
Some of the desires of producers to collect a big hazard causes quality damage.
"The eggs do not become roots on the screen, the swimming and dancing rapidly, the unusual and iromatical middors," adds the medical examples that they are, mostly, pressed by excessive quantities of advantages.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
This is not the introductor of the Siberian physician and technical Institute of Agricultural Problems, the Science candidate for Vera Petruk.
It states that in the proper approach and fulfillment of all standards and requirements, it is possible to produce full fruit.
If they are trying to evacuate more from a square meter, they will, of course, become more frequency, and overcome the mineral feeding.
For example, when too many asotic bearings, the middors are quickly, they are great but waterful and weak," she explains that the quality issue is in the first place depending on the consciousness of the manufacturer.
The Court has stopped the implementation of the decision on the "Stop-y-off" in the New York Department of Police
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal stopped the execution of a court settlement that requires amendments in the programme to stop-y-off the Department of the Police, and removed the Court from the case.
The Appeal Court of the Second United States Department stated that the implementation of the decisions of the Court of Shira Shandlin will be suspended before the results of the appointment given by the city.
In August, the judge claimed that the city had distorted the constitution in the implementation of a programme on different detentions and investigations.
The city made a claim for its decision and settlement of corrective measures, including the prescription to design the controller to help the police to amend work and the training programme with it.
On Thursday, the Appeal Court heard the commitment of the parties on the proceedings of retention.
The Appeal Court stated the need for the court ' s release because it violated the code of the conduct of the U.S. Courts and did not consider the need to avoid the demonstration of prejudice, partly because of the interview series in SMEs and of the official statements containing public response to the criticism of the court.
The judges claimed that the police officers had violated the rights of tens of thousands of people, unbasedly referring to the Black and Latin Americans on the programme "stop-y-obscate".
She designated an external controller to monitor scale changes, including policy, training and control reforms, as well as launching the pilot program for testing videocamers in the police parts in which the majority of detentions occurred.
In August, New York decided to stop the storage of names and addresses of people who were interrupted after police checking.
The town's appointment should be held after 14 March 2014.
"Stop and Research" tactics were criticized by civil rights.
The ‘absorption’ has been in the form of several decades, but the number of documented residues has strictly increased in the administration of the independent Measure Michael Blumberg, in 2011 with a absolute record of 684 330 persons, most of whom black and latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, gave collective requests to the court.
Parts of the changes in the programme "Stop-up" in the New York Department of Police say that these changes are the end of the non-conscious issue, form a more reliable and effective police service and may affect how other police departments are being able to carry out this issue.
The opponents claim that changes will be reduced by the fighting spirit of police, not by crime, lead to unnecessary money traits, and will not solve more globally the problem of policies complex because of decreasing the number of officers for a few thousand in the past decades.
The Court noted that it did not stop the "stop-y-obscate" which corresponded to the constitution, but changes the way New York police remains.
In the Tertiak gallery area, a transitional area was opened
In Moscow there was a new past area.
It is located in the Tertiakov gallery area and participates in two miles from the metro "Novokuznecay" to the Booth area.

Coulson's accommodation for the phone to check the confidential message
The former editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson predicted “the phone, the lamp and the opposite” in trying to confirm false information about the Romania of Clark, who was at that moment of the Minister of Internal Affairs.
The prosecutor, Andrew Eddis, reported to the Court of Audi, that in May 2005 the newspaper News of the World received an incredible news that Clark was met with his "appeal to a special adviser" Hana Polby.
The Gazeta ordered Glenna Molkeir to breathe the voice of Polby and warned her at home to interview, but Coulson also called her and the rest of voting messages, “the court heard.
"The accusation believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now a not-W editor, is not a person who will stand near someone's house, hopeing to stay a person in disgrace, he is a person who loves to offer the story of people to see what they will say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that the news of the World was three ways of historical investigation: telephone broadcasting, lighting and opposite.
The editor is personally interrupted in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the layer, he just needs.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone browsing?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yeah!"
The Romanians of Clark first took attention to the News of the World when the source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polby, said, "Not lose time, it is with Property."
The cassette with voting messages received from her phone at least three times was exempted from the house of Molcair in August 2006.
The supervisors also found records on the private child's computer in which Mrs. Polby and her sister figure as “Projects”.
During the period when she was under the ladder, the grandfather and the grandfather Mrs. Polby received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about it, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, the former main reporter Neville Turtlebek and the former reporter James Wezerape controls the loop of Mrs. Polby's previews.
By leaveing her a voting message on 18 June 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to make tomorrow and I would like to discuss with Property."
Mr. Edis said that Colson's participation in this history was the same scenario as with other influenced people, such as the former Minister for Internal Affairs David Blanket.
The jury heard that Coulson entered the conflict with Mr. Blanket on the conduct of Romana with a married woman while he met himself with Rebecca Brux, who was at that moment married.
Coulson and Brux refused to interact with other people with a view to telephone breakdown between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulqueir, Turk, and Wezerape were recognized in the phone.
Snowden states that it is ready to communicate with the FLG authorities on the matter of hearing
The CIA Ex-cooperator Edward Snowden expresses the ability to come to Germany as soon as it appears to be a legal opportunity, and to meet the representatives of the FRG authorities, the RIA News.
The letter of the former CIA to the FBI authorities at the meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was deputed by the Bangladesh Hans-Christian Strubel, by which Snowden sent a message to German authorities.
The Snowden was in Moscow.
As a result of fire on the Trust Street, four people were lost
As a result of burning in the college in the centre of Moscow, on the Twer Street, four passengers were lost.
As the Interfax reports with a source in external services, one of the losses is hospitalized.
According to the source, the transition of the fuel was lost in a devastated subterranean.
According to RIA News with the head of the Department of Food Energy of Pavle Levin's Master, now the electricity has been completely restored in all houses on the Turkey Street.

United States of Trade for Poor
P's food for families of four people is reduced by $36 per month
Since fifth in the United States, the financial guarantee of product talents as "fudst" is reduced, since the respective public programme is completed.
For the sustainable benefit of the family of four persons, there will now be 36 dollars per month less than before, the Office states.
This will take 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to the Agency of Rayter, the financial year 2012 was a total of $133 per month.
The expenditure for food assistance in the United States increased up to 80 billion dollars per year because of growth without food and prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans are confidenced in the free food assistance issued by " footsteps" which had such a name since the past time when they had a form of paper buffets.
When the current economic crisis was started, the programme was extended to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Responsibles in the Congress require further reductions to be made for the programme by claiming that it should be added to help those who need more others in it.
Manufacturers of the trading stores throughout America are afraid that reductions will lead to decreasing consumer costs.
The United States Congressmen continue to discuss how much more the Government is able to reduce.
Zard released 19-year-old free
Studyzzard freely released its form of 1994 Blackthorne on the PC.
That's what WoW Insider reports.
According to his data, the game was available in Battle.net in the classic games.
However, some gemmers note that it is currently possible to be locked only by users whose accounts are related to the American part of the service.
The game is not available for Russian users.
As before SMI, the version that has been released on the PC is not different from the original game option.
Soundtreek to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne Platformer, which has been released 19 years ago, was essentially on the SNES console.
His events were spread on the Toul planet, whose people were divided into dark and light Kingdom.
One of the dark rulers, Sarah, decided to kill the light King of Vlaros and become a single ruler of the planet.
The main boy of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending to the earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tule to fight Sarlock's hosts and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the study released after her rename to Entertainment.
Before this, she was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was the Interplay company.
In the Moscow Metropolen, new cars will appear.
But they will not be for money but for meetings.
A rate of valuation in 30 rubles will be a potential passport at 30 meetings.
The number of meetings will calculate the special device using modern technology, reporting ITAR-TASS to the Press Service of the Russian Olimpia Committee.
The first equipment will be established on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new billets, the President of the Olympics Committee of Russia Alexander Jukov and the Olympical Champions of Alexander Nem and Elena Zammock will be adopted.
The recognition of the National Security Agency strengthens the paranoid corporations in relation to the State Layer
On the end of August, the German police office was low over the United States Consult in Frankfurt, the German financial capital.
According to the Federal Service of Constitutional Protection (BfV), the Internal Review Services of Germany, it was to photograph the figure of the United States representative, which is less than 5 km from the Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German SMEs say that BfV had hoped to find antenes for listening devices, and these actions were held for negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
In September, James Clepper, Director of the United States National Review, assured again that the United States did not use the possibility of the external disclosure “for the elimination of commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of the American companies to increase their international competition or to increase their arrival”.
However, from the cases such as Edward Snowden, a contractual officer who has made a discharger, began to put up his secretary of the United States, the Peace Governments and the Ru company's secrets are not more confident that you can believe the Director in the word.
The report that the United States National Safety Agency monitored the Brazilian Petrovas petrol company and received access to the data stored by the U.S. cloud services providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoid corporations called by the State at new heights.
The last chapter was aware that the phone of the phone of the Officer of the Angels of Mercel was probably heard about ten years.
If the most powerful person can be a mixture, of course, I will also be business leaders.
Snowden has made an evident intensive cooperation between the United States and the Companies.
I think these data are probably used with mutual benefit.
“The Germany must wake up”, says Oliver Growne, President of the BITMi Assembly, representing the small and medium-sized IT company of Germany.
German companies are convinced that the United States now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial spionage and data dilution, the investigation carried out in July by the EY Consular Agency.
In all documents discovered by Mr. Snowden, however, there were no evidence that the United States had transmitted commercial secrets to foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicals expressed empathy because the EU was not enough for certain incapacity technologies and the Internet, and said that it should try to reduce its dependency from the United States.
Businessmen are strictly related to this.
Someone in Germany's parliament says we must create a German Google.
I can just close the eyes and open them quietly again...
“This is not an option”, says Gaso Plan’ner, the President of the German SAP programme provider.
If it was necessary in the powerful IT industry, it would not have been allowed to lose more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidied in Germany: from angle to cars and farmers.
Everything except IT industry.
However, the importance and technical development of the United States spying agencies, which had been made by Snowden's revelations, appeared to be a shock for some companies who had previously thought that the largest risk of low risk was China.
A great decline occurs in cloud technology, where the Peace companies better realized that data in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to the research carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance Trade Association, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants rejected plans and use of the services of the U.S. ' s clothing of the American programme for the intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Snib, one of the Executive Directors of SAP, said: "We see the users behind the new question that has not occurred a year ago, namely where my data are stored and if you can ensure that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction."
Many Germans say that the last reports are only under what they already knew: the powerful States want to steal their most precious secrets, and therefore these data should be protected by any price.
What happens to the economic spionage is unusual.
He always had a place.
"This was the subject of discussion for many years and has not been changed in the current field," says Kurt Bok, the main executive director of the BASF company.
Americans will spy after us at a commercial and industrial level, and we also are spies behind them, because this is involved in our national interests -- to protect our commercial business.
Corporation leaders usually do not like to deal with the responsible measures they have undertaken, as it may provide an opponent's advantage.
Great companies have already thought that to take a free puzzle on the exhibition or leave a notebook without watching the hotel number is at least invisible.
Ulrich Hakenberg, member of Audi's Audi Car Director's Board, says that it's a standard pro age for many years to collect the phones before the meetings of the Government so that they can't be used as listening devices.
The Federal Service of Protection of the Constitution recommends that companies consider the possibility of use of remote mobile mobile phones in the time of safe poezes because of smartphone vulnerabilities.
Pre-payed mobile cells have recently been released.
However, there is anxiety that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to breast-feeding.
In Germany, many such companies are the leaders of the world's market in their specific neck.
“Small and medium-sized companies often do not have experiences, and financial resources to protect corporate secrets from non-satured access”, warns BfV report.
The United States warns their own companies about economic spying from other countries.
In February, the United States National Research Countries placed France and Russia and Israel in the second range of injuries who are in harker for economic disclosure, after China, states The Washington Post.
The Board of Directors of the German Prestigious Company confirmed that, when speaking about the economic spying, “France is worse to all”.
Bernard Scarsini, an ex-room of the French Internal Agency for the Internal Review Agency, as reported, stated in the interview this month: "The services are well known that all countries, even when they cooperate with terrorism, are spying for their unions."
Parents of a growth from Georgia, who died as a "small accident", believe that their son was killed
The parents of a growth from Georgia, whose body was found within the middle-country mother in the middle-school room, believe that their son was killed, stated to the family on Thursday.
Candrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mother at the back of the tribs in the Middle School.
The supervisors of the Sheriff of Londres' circonscription concluded that Johnson died in a trace of accident, but the family of 17-year-old growth disappointed it.
"They are absolutely sure that their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, representing Kenneth and Jaclin Johnson.
They never believed he died as the sheriff says.
"They believe that it would be contrary to logic, physician laws, and healthy meaning," said Kramp.
They think that it is a cover for human or human protection responsible for the death of their son.
He said, "They sent their son to school with a cup of school, and they returned him to their dwellings."
The American Family Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation of Johnson's death, noted that several key issues remained without answer.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of crime?
The Muir made a statement of the press-conference on Thursday.
I'll study all the facts wherever they are.
My goal is to know the truth.
He said, "I believe that there are sufficient holdings" for an official investigation, he said.
The Mure told the reporters that the original secret showed that Johnson died as a result of the "local Office".
However, the second conveyment, according to Moura, showed another cause of death.
“There are several questions to be resolved or clarified” he said.
The Mure added that if he finds a sufficient opportunity to need Johnson's death investigation or civil investigation, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Sheriff of Londres was not available for a comment when they returned to him on Thursday.
The Court of South Georgia in the middle of the authorities had prescribed to repeat all video records of the monitoring cameras.
The adult parents said that they hoped that video records contained the key to recall how he was dead.
"Spartak": For information about IAHs which have been identified by the fascist symbol
On the official website of Spartaka, a statement of the Moscow Club was made in the Jaroslavle of the Fascist Flag.
"Spartak" on the kitchenmate, "Spartak" 30 October, the non-professors at the stadium in Jaroslavle demonstrated a fascist symbol.

On the other hand, in the cat 1/16, the Coube of Russia Shinnik, "Spartak" was breaking several times because of the devils in the courts.
A fascist symbol has also been demonstrated in the Spartaco disease sector.
In the view of the chastisement of Spartak, there can be about three fats without lookers.
On Friday, the Committee's responsibility will be held again.
If you have information about the person who has translated and brought this symbol, please make sure you are with us.
The control and profile centres of diseases have issued recommendations for schools with children's allergies
In the middle of the control and profile of diseases, the list of recommendations on the control of food alergies in children in school.
This is the first number of similar recommendations that the Government of the United States issued, while the number of children of school age suffering from food alergy.
One of the 20 children in the United States has now a food allergy.
The control and profile of diseases have been discovered that the distribution of food allergy between children has increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
Ru includes information for the school about how to increase the knowledge of teachers and the service officer of food allergy in children and how to provide assistance in case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends schools to keep adrenalina reserves — most often uses EpiPen’s automatic medical screen — to assist in the potential mortal anafil.
The laws of the State authorities have recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make adrenalina reserves with less difficulties.
The notice also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "a feeling like something's going into my tongue," "a feeling that I have hair in my tongue" or "the speech of the bottle."
Intersexual Children's parents may choose "unspecified"
Germany became the first country of Peopea, which recognised the third half of children born with the internal sex bodies.
The newborn will no longer be obliged to register husband or woman.
The new law does not require parents to call any of such children by allowing parents to specify the field as “unspecified” or “instaled” in their birth certificates.
The objective of the Law was to delay the pressure of parents who could make successful decisions on the adoption of sex newborn, and to oppose discrimination of intersectional people.
One intersectional man, BBC, said many years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm gonna be made by doctors of a bullet with blue and shirts.
About one of two thousand children, born every year, is not a boy or a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological states that fall under the diagnosis of "soil development" — a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, genders (e.g. or seeds) or increasingly developed by armed sex bodies.
Wellis Simpsson maybe was an intersection.
The general identity has not been studied until this point, but most experts in the United States say that if it is not defined, it is better to use the whole inhibition and to allow it to wait and follow the psychology and physology development of the child before the operation, if it happens.
The New York psychiater, Dr. Jack Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr., which is specialized on the issues of gender identity, said that the new German law "sounds as a good idea".
Intersexua children create a ethical dilemma.
"There are some people who have a threatening life that requires operational interactions, but most of them do not have," he said.
You can provide a field without operation and then see how the person is developing.
The science of how a child will discover any gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this happens.
It's like a mystery of why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the Committee in 2011 describes intersexual people as a difference from transsexual or transgenderous, since they have no respect for the gender but to their biological building, which does not correspond exclusively to male or female sex, and typically for both, or not characteristic for any of them.
These characteristics may be shown in secondary field characteristics such as muscle mass, inflammation, breast and body; primary half characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalities, or in the structure of chromose and hormones.
The report also provides a common presentation of discrimination with intersection and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as the level of pressure, violence and crimes on the ground of prejudices.
Boys with gender rejections have a special camp now.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put a man, woman or "three" in their official documents.
In June 52-year Australia, Norry May-Walby -- the first person in the world recognized as "less" was in the court to maintain the "unspecified" half status for the whole life.
In the report of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in German passports the third sign will be used in addition to M and F-X, which is intersectional.
Gender issues in neighbouring France are still addressed to the opposite of France, which is a new report on France 24.
In 2011, the decades of French legislators, this clearly expressed catalogue of the country, signed five of the exhibition of the "gender theory" from school teachers.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed non-concerning with the German law, wrote that “in the situation where the world is involved in a new part of the world, where the field is an object of choice, and the sexual activity is not, we turn on two other columns of civilization”.
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to establish a field at birth.
“To enjoy a child is quite hard and without additional performances, especially if you don’t know the half of your child” she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and confidence.
History children who were born with male and female bodies were called Hermaphrodites, named a beautiful Greek god who had the signs of both sex.
And only ten years ago, the medical community accepted gender as a sheet on which everything could be watched and then drawn again.
But now, many are spending the ethics for the operation, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and sometimes the doctor makes an unfair choice, unless the child knows how he will take the field to him when he grows.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "unfavorable psychiatric case", said Drusher.
When such children were born, you called no psychiater — you called the chirurg.
The dominant theory of how to handle children with the genitality of the intermediate type was proposed by Dr. John Many from the University of Jones Hopkins, who believed that gender was easily changed.
He introduced the term “generic identity” and said that the signals of the environment, including the characteristics of the parent of the child, were interacting with genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would be a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, as John/Johann, his teories were subject to the question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was injured during an unfair circumcision, to castrate the child, to remove his eggs, and to hold it as a girl.
"Mani had the case as a successful example of transition, but it was not true," Drusher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he repeated a boy and married a woman.
But in 38 years, he committed suicide.
Drusher said that some doctors are still "using this model".
But in the 1990s, with the Internet's arrival, people who survived these sex change operations said, "only with a result."
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with men's XY chromosomes, but the genitals of the intermediate type.
The doctor could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitor or a small penis, and they were convinced that he could never live a "valuable life" of men.
Thus, after he was born in 1976, the external half body and Bruce's eggs were chirurgically removed, and he was grown up as a girl.
He began to give female hormones at age 12 years.
"I knew I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunate, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
In 18 years, he was appointed a vaginoplastic.
But when he was in depression and realized that something was wrong, he needed a medical document.
What he knew was terrible.
I was sterilized when I was born, and no one told me about it.
Bruce was born with the disturbance of sexual development, which did not give its body to produce sufficient teststeron for normal genital development.
When he learned the truth, he repeatedly repeatedly made a man with a testosteron and removed his breast.
The operation made it unfruitful.
Today, it provides the protection of others in the organization called Interface Project, trying to bring people with intersection.
But Anne Themar-Mettis, the Executive Director of the Californian Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is convinced that the German law “promotes the eggs and the reach”.
“Multiple activists are concerned that the German law will urge parents to make a successful decision and give the child a "unspecified field"," she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to the employment.
We think it's better to give a man or a woman's field and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will show us, so everything we can do is building imaginations.
Themar-Mettis said that it supports the Australian Law, since “He allows adults to choose for the benefit of the third sex”.
“Augling people must have the opportunity to take their own decisions on formal sex belonging”, says she.
The German law submits her adoption when he was born.
This is a fight in which little children should not be involved in this stage.
When they grow, they will be able to make decisions of their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Baratz, mamolog-rentogenologist from Pi'sburg, who has a daughter with the disturbance of sexual development and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law will "support" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Kathy, was born with men's chromosomes, but she has a semi-development named "syndrome of full insensitiveness to the anthrogens".
Since her ANDRA receptors work incorrectly, Cathy has developed women's characters.
She's got a shot, but there's no mothers and jackets.
Now, in 29 years, Cathy's married and passed by the Orthinature on the psychiatric at Pen-Vani University.
Despite its unfruitfulness, she hopes to become parents through the creation or gestational surrounding maternity.
"The Law gives the parents time to not take successful decisions to themselves," Baratz said.
He gives them time to make some analysis and to discover the situation, as well as time before they write "man" or "women".
In that case, you’re okay, you’re a child, you love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joyful.
We don't have to make an oper that is unnecessary.
“It allows the members to participate in the decision and eliminates the concern that moves to parents because they do not feel that the progress is correct,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what he or she are more comfortable, and it is wonderful.
This provides the opportunity to make decisions in the same way.
The Chicago's brother Nicolai Habibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard on training.
At the last two meetings, Habibulin had spent six sheep from Tampa-Bay, and then four of "Ottyva", and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth lost shib.
We need to play well, and in the last two games I haven't done this, the CSNChicago's words of Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, probably, to approach them as a game, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and overcome the deficiencies that have been.
There's a few small components I need to improve, but in training I feel very pretty.
But something after a few -- it's all turning into some snow com.
Maybe I need to get a little funny.
Friends - I don't think I'm the one - always trying to play a perfect game.
If I'm missing four, five, six, I'm not looking at it.
It doesn't matter what happens before my doors.
I'm still working on myself so I can't lose so much shib.
It's amazing that my colleagues support, but in principle, it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games are not all the season, but I wanted to do them much better.
But what happened.
I have to put it on the side.
I'm just gonna try to play a bitch better.
The travel bus was turned to Altae.
In the Rubsian region, the travel bus was converted to the PAZ.

The Energy of the Dane-Peteration began a unique salvation programme...
In the old age to bring to the court of aists, the villages on the high column set a wheel from the telephone, and the heavy neck was well held on it.
Such special oppositions have no longer been placed, so the aists have been accused of the electro-transmission columns - the cross-border boxes are on the driving, and the true house is trusted.
A grandfather Anna, near the village of Ivanock of Petrikov, who lives in the true family for twenty years, began to note how the nidge is inhabited, despite all the efforts of his people.
The birds put the top of the new boxes, and the lower layer has already passed between the leaders, so it's going to move.
Of course, the family of aids who were disturbed each year at the coasts were carried out and covered for three-four birds in a year, but it does not want to remain without light.
Soon as the birds fled to the warm side, Anna's grandfather called the Carichanian RS, whose opposite belongs.
And I didn't even expect to react there so quickly.
When our specialists came to Ivanowk, they were surprised that the nido was still holding, - said the DTEK Technical Director of Deneprovolenergo Sergei Berezovski.
In fact, inside the neck, 150 to 200 kilograms, it has been started to be corrupted.
At any time, the birds could be lost from the electricity.
Yes, and the inhabitants of the risk remain without light because of the injury.
Thus, linear motors began oper for the salvation of the nine, but not for the first time in our case.
Scientists-ornitologs from the National University of Dnepropetrovs, who have been able to carry out the nine transfer scheme.
They also conducted training for regional networks.
Known Daily Ornitolog Alexander Ponomarenko Advisory of Energy at all stages of the Niz River.
For the beginning, it was estimated that more than 50 true "quarters" are in the area of a disaster.
For their floor, special metal forms were made to be recorded.
The foundation was covered by the birds, and then the old nidge was transferred there.
According to the characteristics, it is enough to put old bottles as a basis for the birds to know the nidge and return to it.
Then the aists will have their own apartment.
A month ago, in the village of Novomoskov, the first nidge was found in the village of Novomosk.
The electricity and the electropore have set a new iron table and set a form on it with an old, already inhabited jail.
The whole operation was spent with nine thousand insurance.
In the days, the same new village was located in the village of Ivan, the city of Petrikov, on the coast of the grandfather Ana.
The formula was set up here on the former term, and it was only added to the conduct.
Ornitologists are convinced that cautious, conservative birds will not even note the weight that their " apartment" has fallen into capital replacement.
Before the end of the year, the river expects four other necks in the Poker and Kingdom areas of the Daneprofederance.
Moreover, while some of the rare birds are saved, others are unfortunately killing them.
On the day, the whole area of the floor is a newspaper in the village of Ust-Commenc of the Apostles, on the day of the opening of the fashion, the bridegroomers had shot the Lebeth family that lived in the cup.
The birds were not afraid of people, but the inhabitants of their foods and they did not hurt.
When the shooters heard the shoots came to the woods, the four beauty-leavens had already been lying on water.
Now the apostle’s Milition’s Division is explaining who shot in the birds recorded in the Red Book.

Communication: Obama's pre-selected stab considered the exception of Bayden in favour of Hillary Clinton
The New York Times reported, the nearby advisers of President Barak Obama in secret considered the possibility of replacement of Vice-President Joe Bayden's candidate by Hillary Clinton in the election list of 2012.
This opening is the most clear sentence of all the expected book Mark Galperin and John Hayleman on the 2012 campaign "Double: Game has changed 2012".
The Times received an example prepared for the outcome of the book and reported on Thursday evening that the next president's assistants had conducted “mass investigations in the focal groups and public opinions at the end of 2011” to evaluate whether the exception of Baiden could help to raise the hopes of re-electing Obama.
According to the report of the political observer The Times Jonathan Mar, the book provides a detailed description of the tentatives of high-instructed representatives of the pre-elected state and the White House, namely the former Chapter of the White House, Bill Daily, to evaluate the effect of voting by the former secretary of Clinton Vice-President.
The potential replacement was a secret, firmly protected in the Chicago pre-election station and in the Ovulal Office.
Only six closer advisers of the President, including Daily, the former Chair of the Presidency of Obama Jima's son, and the elders of the White House David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew that the replacement was considered.
The Duplicate Book states that Daily was an initiator of the tentative to replace Bayden, despite their "nearest characteristics", but at the end, it was rejected when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the electoral list would not "build the opportunities of Obama".
In the interview with Martin Daily, the administration had actually considered the possibility of replacement of Bayden Clinton.
“I was actively expressed for the consideration of the facts, and it was one of them,” said the Daily newspaper.
You should remember that the President was in a terrible form at that moment, so we thought, "O my God, what do we do?"
Although Daily warned the investigation as a "necessary check", Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-selected staff was sufficiently involved in the study of whether this stage would bring the vote to the vote.
"Predependent staff shall not lose such amounts of money on question and focus group, if they do not consider anything serious," said Martin in the AK 360 programme.
It is not clear, however, that Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told the CNN that he asked Daily whether he knew his timely boss about the possibility of transmission.
Although Daily said he was not thinking that the President was “in the course” of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration recognized that Obama knew, "no"
Martin added that "Double Steps" does not give a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political divisions were reached to the table of Obama.
Cooper asked Mar ́, whether he believed seriously that Obama was not aware of the investigation of the possibility of avoiding the Bayen from the choice.
“It is possible”, answered Martin.
Do you want the light in the darkness of the dark?
The British undertaking created the first world lighting in the darkness of meat.
Francis exposed the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animal to divorce the light food.
He came to this idea by reading the Scientific article on Mediums, and convinced the scientists in China to rebuild chemically a lighting white.
The wheat reacts to the language of a man who eats it and increases the pH level in the white and makes it light.
Chris says that since the fat begins to light when he reacts to the warm mouth, it means that as much as you lie, it becomes lighter.
The foundation of the company on the production of the frozen, "Lize me, I'm cool," says, "This is a wonderful thing, but still at the main stage if you talk about production, so you'll get about 2 £200."
The white that we use in the wheel is in response to your language in neutraal pH.
So when your mouth burns the white, it will increase the pH level and the mood will begin to light.
We tested it in the past few months, and it seemed perfect to place it in Halloween because it creates such a wonderful lighting effect.
This may be the lovers of what I did, because the luminosity of the medium is four times more worth of gold.
So every shot is about 140 £.
That's why it's pretty pleasant for a cuss.
The experimental company, located in Bristol, was recognised by its inhabitants, including bird, syringe, bowling and sugar gold.
But his creation must be even more amazing.
He said, “I want to describe the invisible thing.”
It's not because of the fraction of ice cristals from which it is soft, but I think we're going to find a way to do it.
It uses fluorescent properties of medus synthesized by Chinese scientists

They've all seen the first time of the murder against the Metallurga.
The game was performed for, and the account was 2:0.
They've lost the bullet in the division, and in the third period, they've been wronged.
Regarding the hardness of the game, he didn't see the meaning of the binding of protectors.
We need to defend the whole team.
Now the "Avangard" long home series, the mads go on a day -- the team's buried the wrath?
All teams are in the same terms.
The main thing now is the issuing of its moments and the implementation of the playing task.
Hockey is a emotional game, if you do the installation, it's not so difficult.

We and our sister have been allowed to eat confessions, not to lie down to sleep and make a mask for our area.
I'm looking like a screw now.
I have not been invited to deliver confidence in my apartment in the last two years and, mostly, I will not be this year.
However, the statistics show that I am the white wheel of Hellovine.
According to the National Trade Federation, most of the Americans — exactly 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and totally have 6,9 billion dollars on confections, costumes and improvements.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Trade Federation proposes that $1,2 billion of $6,9 billion on costumes.
This year, on the sex mode of sexual matters are unexpected.
Women are no longer required to be representatives of sexual professions; they may also be sexual food, such as pizzze, hamburgers or mariners.
What's going on men, I think we'll see the zombies thanks to the "God dead" and I'm sure the cosmonaves in the Daft Punk group will fall into our Instagram bands this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are looking for most often are zombies, Bethman, pirates and wheels.
Please, there's nothing wrong in the traditional approach.
We arranged our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not only.
Moreover, the National Trade Federation, the Americans will take $330 million on the costume for domestic animals this year.
This means a lot of fun dogs.
When the matter comes to the continent, we're not laughing.
The Americans will take 1.9 billion dollars this year, Nilsen's company.
It's about 600 million pounds of the Hershey chocolate, ice, Milk Duds, Twizzlers, and Clark Bar baths.

Moreover, we will buy and we will not be lying — we will eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we do not want to use is the confections in the form of sugar cereals; however, the National Conduct Association of Contracters is sold by about 35 million pounds under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion separate cucurrors.
It's a mystery I'm still supposed to talk.
There's nothing like Halloween's house with a vision.
They have the names such as the "Free outside the walls" (which is, in the present case), the "He and the cry" and the "Shock House".
Moreover, in America Haunts, there are 1200 officially recognised houses with advantages generating about $500 million and those income graphs where you almost described what your friend has exposed on Facebook, and you can't remove, and then the guy you like will see this graph and remain comments like "classical expression".
And finally, we'll talk about the tickets.
Brown met us with the Great Tick, when we were children, and Jack's lighter is as the wrath of the birthday hedge, what we do from the wedding.
Happy for us, the child's mode was just started in the past year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up by cutting these tickets instead of sitting in them.
According to the Office of the United States Records, the Americans will take about $106 million per year.
Jack's lighter, quietly sleeping on your wheel, probably came from Illinois State, who has grown 542 million pounds of tickets in this year.

Her ladies, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old Becky Hall friend, were located at the fleeppit carrier in Denholm in West Yorkshire to join Ruby and welcomed the fire-free service of West Yorkshire.
They solemnly looked for their crazy dog and placed trafficking on the web sites after she fled to the carrier after a small airport.
Approximately at 14:15 in the middle of the star room, Ruby noticed that he had 50 feet [50 feet] in the carrier.
The Technical Rescue Team of the Fire of Clekhiton has rapidly reached the event, descended down on the beaches to save Ruby, and put it up to the top of the decline.
The Officer of the Officer of the Officer of Andy Clayton said, "He was in a dangerous situation."
She was right in the middle of the middle of the wheat, 50 feet to the top and to the earth.
She didn't move a muscle during the salvation, she was completely silent.
But now she's okay.
Then she's a song.
It was a very unusual call.
The fact that the dogs have noticed is incredible.
The Officer-specialist saved Peter Law's officer said, "Ruby was very happy to save her."
It was likely that she could get a very serious trauma or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinary, and it was established that it was okay with it, with exception of exhaustion and disorder.
Mrs. Hall from Galifax, West Yorkshire, said, "The watch of salvation was `.
I couldn't believe she was there.
It was wonderful when she was once again on our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she had lost her conscience, she would, mostly, fall.
The fires were beautiful.
It was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely thankful.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added: "We feared that she could fall, but she remained there."
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she's about it.
Mike Jagger says he didn't play with Cathy Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview in the Australian Road this week, Pop-star stated that she was a bac-vokalist for the song of Jagger 2004 Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a rock-veterin and said, "He played with me when I was 18."
She added, "This was a long time, and he was very good."
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of the seventy-year-old Jagger said that “the category refuses that he had ever disappointed Cathy Perry”.
The representative added: "It is likely that he will travel him with someone else."
Perry was among artists who appeared as a guest in Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new Prism album is worth the first one of this week.
George Kerevan: Disruption with Property gives Scotland's choice
Another day, another income on independence.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland should be joined to the public free move zone as a EU membership conditions.
There is a series of stories on pass control in Berwick and the border with a cross-border cross-border to the Adrian's wall.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper has economic benefits from more free movements to the rest, although it was not in the titles.
No one also pointed out that the EU Member States have lost a lot of time to repeat their rules as appropriate.
Since Scotland is not now in the Schengen zone, the continuation of the unconformity of the requirements will become a deep step for Brussels, instead of what he really wanted from Scotland.
So that's not a deserving attention to history.
And it was so old that it was converted into rockyness: first I heard a "subscription" about "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Yet there's an interesting moment that's lost when the old story is overwhelmed.
Why should independent Scotland comply with the proposals?
Why to change London's yarm to Brussels' yar, especially now?
Here are these news: a great successful plan to join the end has been suspended.
With the crisis, the project "Ev" is officially dead.
In all cases, the Parties against the EU or by rejection of a single currency are forced.
Even in Germany, the "Alternative for Germany" party, which was only this year, came from nowhere and received approximately five million votes on the federal elections in September, thus pressing the "Free Democrats" (Liberal Democrates' analogue) from Bangladesh.
There was always an internal opposition to the establishment of the federal plan.
However, the current economic crisis at a breakpoint moment.
The serious economy measured by Berlin and the Central Bank, and the eye on national economy by maintaining one currency, brought many people to think that the Ev’a project was too far.
Crisis -- a little -- because national governments work in excessive budget deficits, it was just just for Greece.
In fact, the blocking system of its members on exchange courses for German exporters is that German policies and want to maintain.
Without the possibility of depreciation of the national currency, the south is in the early unusual situation in comparison with Germany.
The only rescue means to cut loans and public costs actively supported by Berlin.
The current issues of the budget and currency are the depth of the productive ways.
As a result of the "green" energy measures introduced by Brussels, the encryption, which represents the subsidiation of French and German energy companys in the account of the consumer, will be two times more electricity and four times more than in the United States.
This is a paralyzing price conditions, as we have already seen in Grandjute.
No payment in the world will remain a disturbing winning of the U.S. solar gas debt over the Peace oil industry.
As a result, the rebellion, particularly in France, is ever the worst EU side.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a means of obtaining political stability, and he has already linked its own economic policy by leaving the disrupted economy of France in a disaster.
Results are the right of the Marin Le Pen 'National Fort against the EU, just wined the decision-making elections, with the third part of the socialists' governing party.
“Front” is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of votes — a timely warning to the British libarists of the fact that it comes from the idea that the railways between the rights are automatically used for the use of the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newly identified population among the French white slave class?
She wants to take elections in the EU in the year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against one currency.
If this is very probably aid against the EU party to these elections, such blocks will first take a dominant position in the House.
This is my opinion: Immediate constitutions against the EU and against the single currency are sold in a military way to make it possible.
The EU will not decline, but it will again become something like the "Ev's (super) nations" that liked General de Holly.
Germany and several economics dependent on it can maintain, but France and South will restore their own currencies.
I guess that the United Kingdom is disconnected from this project, hopeing to draw close to the United States.
Nevertheless, the interest of Washington to the Pacific shows the probability that the United Kingdom remains without attention in the Atlantic cold.
In what situation will this remain in Scotland?
We can choose to be the region (in fact) of Small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, besides, sending Berlin and Brussels to the shirts.
I understood that Scotland would be able to succeed in the more free Peace agreement when we would keep our currency.
Cooperation with other individual countries will be easier in the non-federality of the nations.
In contrast, we should consider the possibility of resuming the experience of Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scotland National Party in Scotland is, as well as strangely, the most successful political movement in the area of the heavy economy, which has received a majority of votes in 2011 through the reactions against the reductions of the costs proposed (and called) by the Leaborist rate of Alister Darling and resulted in the coalition of the two and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now be uncomfortable to vote for independence only to take measures on the heavy economy of Berlin and Brussels.
Earlier sex: Age before
The African and Latin Americans, as usually, have reached the half growth before their white coasts, have been studied.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual growth is close
No evidence of hormones or other chemical arts
Experts believe that heat epidemics may be one of the starting mechanisms of the early sealing
The tendence to early half adults is not so exposed to boys
The former co-respondent CNN Pat Eterge is a journalist specialised on family health and questions.
Should the mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form the beginning of the milk iron and grow the lower hair in 7 or 8 years?
At the annual Conference of the American Pediatric Academy on this week in Orlando, Florida, the Endocrinolog Dr. Paul Caplavitz explained that these early physical changes were sufficiently distributed among the American girls and represented a new standard.
"I'm going to take a lot of time to relax your parents -- it usually doesn't mean a fast acquiring of the full-sized growth," said Caplavitz.
The evidence of development, such as breasts, lobby and mixed hair and body dishes, appeared before girls.
But there was only a small movement in the age of me (the first measurement) during the last four decades.
The average age in the United States was 12.5 years and was decreased in comparison with 12.75 in 1970.
“When the breast begins to develop, it is at least two or three years before me”, said Caplavitz, as well as the author of the book “Laughter sex in girls: how to cope with this disseminated problem.
The time is the most precise verification of how sex creation will progress.
It is discussed that it is the fact of the semi-violence, but it is considered “pre-temporary” when the growth of the breast is increasing to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will be disturbed or stopped is that the pediater can follow carefully.
More rapid progress can be served for an endocrinolog analysis in order to avoid serious problems such as powder or ox.
There are procedures in order to maintain early meals and to prevent another consequence: the preliminary age of the bone, which finally can lead to the deterioration of growth and low growth in adults.
Recommendations on medical or hormonal therapy are based on age of child, development, growth and emotional growth.
Psychossociation is also important.
Caplavitz is aware of medicines, but it recognises that “the deterioration of the seal may reduce the behavior problems and feelings of girls that they are different from the neighborhoods”.
Another big problem is understanding: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have mistakes.
“They are concerned about the risk of ambiguity or even how they are going to cope with the hygiene issues”, said Caplavitz.
“It was a shock”, recalls one woman whose daughter has started in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about me, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from a scared and disappointed school because she was the first of her friends.
There are a lot of theoretes on the reasons of early sealing.
Nevertheless, there is no consequences of the fact that hormones have been committed in milk or other food products, chemical nutrition in the environment or sex have been sent to mass information.
Boys — as well as girls — have sexual growth before.
Caplavitz states that the preferences, which have the greatest weight, are the epidemy of the heat.
In 2001, he helped girls to investigate from 6 to 9 years, which relates to the number of grass in the body with a period of half-breeding.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute.
In this country, the African and Latin Americans have usually reached the half growth before their white coasts.
There are different explanations.
Over the world, the earlier sex creation, of course, affects everything: from economic and climate to genes.
More mystery: Although the boys have hair on the face and on the bottles in a younger age, the tend to completely bearing sex is not as much as girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP Conference have confirmed the complexity of this issue.
Even young children and children of age are met by the appearance of the hot and the lobby hair.
"We must be aware of how we determine the real term of sex," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, an endocrinolog in the Hospital of Goreab in Mr. Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be disturbed to receive guidance from the child's instructions about how to talk to their child.
“It can mean more early than expected,” explained Caplavitz.
If you keep calm, your child normally reacts well.
The girls who are blowing early need to be understood that even when it happens before it, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing held in Lithuania is ready to flee
The aircraft of the United States Airport on Friday, 1 November, will leave the city's aircraft at 8:30 at Moscow time.

Reacting aircraft producers injure the width of the seat when large orders on the horse
Among the leaders of the plane manufacturers, the width of the tourist class's seats was spread by a tone to the Dubai Airport for this month.
The speed turns around the width of the seats granted on the next trip to the economy class passengers whose interests are not always in the centre of aircraft attention, while the amount of space for them plays a key role in the efficiency of the last aircraft Airbus SAS and Boeing Co Airbus.
Airbus was invited to introduce a growth standard that would provide the width of the seat at least 18 cm (46 cm) in the economy-class salons, but its main American competitor Boeing says that it should decide the aircraft.
At the time of the sales of aeroplane producers with more larger versions of their two-motor remote aircrafts, and for 17-21 November, potential recording orders are expected.
The backcomposition of the plane, especially if 9 or 10 persons are in a range, takes the central place in statements on the economic efficiency of new "min-aeroboys" projects.
Boeing approves that its updated 777X will place 406 persons from the seats in the economic class more than 17 degrees in the width of 10 in each range.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 persons in the economy of the class at the seats of 18 degrees, divided by 9 per row.
Aeroplane cycles are often exchanged by technical injuries using the advertising in professional press.
Now Airbus is directly referring to the public before the airport in Dubai, where 777X, as expected, will become leader with more than 100 orders.
She was recently a demonstrator, which could be the beginning of the new reklame war, showing the diamonds of three people in the restaurant, called "Will you agree to this?"
“Boeing will be a long-term airmaster at seats lower than in regional tourist airlines”, said Airbus John Lihi selling.
With changes, racial foods are weighted, but aircraft seats have not changed cardiacly.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the broadcasting Boeing 747 set standards for modern remote travels, and the department of the United States Health Department has increased by the age of 40 to 49 years.
The volume of the median American man in the 21th century includes 39.7 d.u., based on the statistics of the United States Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor is holding the concept of the 1950s of seats when the average range of the taxes of those who have recently been called "reactive P" was already.
Airbus says that an investigation that witnesses that the additional pound in the width of the seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing sprays the Airbus numbers by the sizes of the seats and says that producers should not be involved in the decisions on how the aircrafts are found in a balance between tariffs and benefits.
According to her, investigations suggest that the benefit of the salon depends not only on the width of the seat.
"All is actually due to the delivery of aeroplanes and the possibility of doing what they have to do in their opinion to succeed," said the expert Boeing on the Kent Craver Salons.
They don't want us to decide what will bring them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
The question for passengers is increasing the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is more often a factor that may affect the arrival.
In this context, the plane for aeroplanes estimated at least $700 billion per catalog prices in the next decade is sufficient to change the proportion of the American and Peopean export.
As the first reported in July, the Agency of Rayter, the location of seats is exactly that the fight between the newest reactive aircraft is to be covered.
The Airbus and Boeing state the 20 percent increase in accessibility on one place in their last two-motor remote models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's characteristics are partly compared to 10-local lines 777X with the original 9-local composer of the 777-local resolution.
The winning in detail is decreased in comparison with the 10-local composite currently used.
"The reason for Boeing to do this is to press more and make his flight more competitive in comparison with our times," said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort.
On the other hand, the analysers say that the salons with a full 10-local range for 777-years show that many passengers prefer to the fleshly distribution that can be handed with lower tariffs.
"The width of eighty-twenty pounds would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that Airbus's proposal has been threatened by 777 models," said the specialist on the interview of Mary Kirby, the base and editor of Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't set a chair, but they have a directory of suppliers from which a flying company can choose.
Those who travel worldwide sellers of reacting aircraft even carry rockets in order to check competitive planning.
By praising the comfort, all manufacturers also have aircrafts with a very fleshly compound for budgetary aircraft and regional flights.
Airbus is A350 with 10-local rows, but he says she has not sold it yet.
Airbus has recently highlighted the need for additional salons modes, with larger spaces in some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major modern aircraft manufacturer, as the experts say, calling it to a new growing standard if it is “flow”, but it may be aware of the sale of model 777X.
New antimicotian vaccine can stop the process of smoking of satisfaction
Scientists had a anti-micotian vaccine that could stop the fucking cigarettes of satisfaction.
One dose of vaccine was thrown to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence for the whole life.
The need for further tests before the beginning of people's experiences is required for several years, but Professor Ronald Cristal from the Medical College Wayle Cornel in New York stated that the first results were hoped.
“We hope that such use of the vaccine can finally help millions of bulkers who tried to leave and test all the methods on the market today, but have discovered that their notional dependency is sufficient to overcome it with these modern resources,” said Professor Cornel.
The new vaccine contains no virus, which was diluted to bring genetic information to the production of anticotine anticorps.
The virus is selectively infecting the vine cells that then begin producing a stable antichell flow.
Anthony follows any molecules in the blood by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the obtaining of nicotine screen.
In the tests, the vaccinated mouse, which later gave nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the muscles that did not give the vaccine were "smocked" and that is the sign that nobody came to their brain -- the researchers say,
These experiments are described in the Science Translatation Medicine magazine.
Previous tabacco vaccines had failed because they had antenites.
In order to maintain the high level of anchor, the areas were to do so often that they were lover and unprotective.
But the value of the new vaccine will probably be much lower because it converts the cells in antender factory.
Professor Cristal said that if the future vaccine was fully safe, it could be given to Â ́s before they had the desire to try a cigarette, preventing the nicotine dependency.
But more probably it's going to be used by the puzzle to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they begin to smoke again, they will not be satisfied from this because of a nicotine vaccine, and that can help them to get free of this habit," he said.
The British scientists said that the results were interested, but warned that the investigation would be supplemented.
Oleinic: Third landscape Submovies
Vice-governmental Governor of Jury Olaynik stated that almost three landscapes in the Moscow area I have been completely awarded
Total contributions from the region's budget are obtained by 187 inhabitants from 288.
In 2013, 187 inhabitants from 288 receive assets from the regional budget.
A detailed amount of contributions in the 122 income budget increases 50 per cent and 83 per cent.
In the budgetary framework of the regional budget, 25 billion rubles are directed,” said Olaynik.
The vice-governmentary also noted that only in three cities, Vitisz, Unicoco and Pushino, the amount of budget income is more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
Income in many areas of rural villages less than 3 million rubles, "it's totally not enough."
The expenditure for the content of the administrative equipment in 88 villages of the Submoscow is more than 70 per cent, "the reduction of service quality is observed," said Olaynik.
Earlier, he ordered the heads of the Municipal Schools to consider what places are needed to be assembled, united in the city area or changed the administrative management system.
These proposals will be made from the end of January.
Before this, the Governing Board of Moscow stated that in the framework of the administrative reform in the Submoscow, the number of landscapes is planned to reduce.
Moreover, in Mosambique, Cashire, Solne Nuclear, Column, Luberts and Cotellers are requested to enhance municipalities.
The discussion of this issue will be started in November in cities and regions.
The Chairman of M’Igory Brinals also stated that the next admireform plans for approximately 30 landscapes in 12 areas of the Submoscow.
This relates to that from 178 landscapes in Submoscow, at least thirds have a "acceptable" financial basis and 100 rates.
Diana Arbenin released Hellowin with her children
Diana Arbenin does not hide what a great pleasure she receives from the education of her children.
Despite the fact that Arbenine is currently giving the creation and public activities much time, she still finds the opportunity to go with Martha and Artham, not only to take time for their training but also to distract how possible.

Tripody refuses to have the impact of Obaida
The former Ministry of the Work of New South Wales Jo Tripody will be the investigation of the anti-corruption supervisory body of this state.
The former Minister for the New South Wales Jo Tripodi rejects the amendment to the order of the maritime objects on the request of his political teacher Eddie Obaida, who has secretly owned parts in three objects of independence in the State country.
The independent committee against corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation on Friday to whether Mr. Obaid had several ministers of the State to extend the arrangements on Serquilar Ki, where the family of Obaeds belonged to two restaurants and coffee, without prejudice to the tender after the duration of their action in August 2005.
It now investigates the fact that Mr. Tripodi knew about the secret participation of Mr. Obaida in the objects of inevitability, after the evidence of the former head of the administration of Mr. Tripody Linn Espoul on Thursday.
During several years of discussion, beginning in 2005, the Government insisted on the open concurrence.
Arrangers were against it, and they wanted more longer than the airport.
In 2009, the contracts of firms on Serquilar Ki, which brought about $2,5 million per year, were extended without exposure to an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially expressed open competitions.
But he refused that changes were made at the request of Mr. Obaida, who, as Mr. Tripody recognized, urged to make changes to the government's arrange policy.
The ICAC submitted phone decryption was introduced in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeidom, Mr. Tripody and Steve Dan, the higher officer, who came to the Port Ministerial after working under the leadership of Mr. Obaida in fishing.
"As there a question discussed in the course of these phones, the development of the trade policy?" asked Commissioner Anthony Willi, Mr. Tripod.
"No," Mr. Tripody answered. —
I can't remember what I was talking about, but it was certainly not that.
It's definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to the high-leaving officer, Israeli military aircraft attacks the goals within Syria
The high-level administration officer in the Fox News Interview confirmed that the Israeli military aircraft had been attacked at the Syrian port of Latvia on Thursday evening.
The facter did not point out that it was for the purpose, but he said at least one.
Assoshiade Press reports that the Russian production rackets were targeted.

External slaves on sub-class 457 may be expressed for “depreciation”
The ‘defence’ test for foreign slaves in the class 457 visum is considered by the Government, as it intends to extend the repressive measures.
This test will, if it is adopted, apply to the criteria aimed at preventing the use of the 457 visibility of the class to comply with unqualified debts or as a laze for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The document presented by the Government to discuss today was repeated while the former Leaborist deputate of the son discovered the Government ' s ritorium of foreign slaves, saying that it could be abused of the neighbors of Australia.
"The Great statements of the type "foreigners at the end of the end" and "sna > the Australians" are a very uncomfortable turn to the time when the professionals needed a protected work market," she said to the Institute "Australia - India" today.
It was historically meaning that the white work had to be protected, and if some of the region saw the votes of this historical artefact, I would not be surprised.
The document presented is 12 measures, which were previously considered as former immigration ministers by Chris Bowen.
The Brandan O'Connor Immigration Minister, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met the official counterparts of people, has already produced five of the recommended changes, and the rest are in the stage of consideration.
If the criteria of ‘adequacy’ are adopted, the applicant may examine the subject of ‘ whether the candidate is present in the condition where the candidate is a family or a nearly known owner or a person with regard to the qualification of the undertaking’.
Undertakings may also need to be reported by the number of owners in sub-category 457, since the undertakings intended to sponsor a small number of persons and then accepted a hundred.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lanki, seeking a refuge, died predictly from the infarct after the arrival of a ship with refugees to the Christmas island this week.
The killed nine-year-old son of this man led him on the road to Australia, and since his father's death in the middle of him, he supported a twice-old brother, who was also on the board of the ship.
The Australian authorities quickly sent a man to the Hospital of Christmas, where he died.

The Government of the United Kingdom announced an investigation aimed at enhancing the economic effect for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project provides for the opening of a high-level report with Scotland and North England, starting the first stage in 2026
The Minister for Transport of Baronesa Kramer noted that the project “United Britain”.
The Ministry of Transport of Scotland, Kit Brown, said that he was “in exquisite” from the worker on the plan with the Government of the United Kingdom.
The first stage will be in the building of a new high-speed rail line between London and West Midland.
When the second stage is closed, the lines will be proposed in Manchester and Lyds.
In June, the Government reviewed the valuable value of the high-level building between London and North England from £32.7 to $42.6 billion.
The Government of the United Kingdom, which has been negotiated with the Transport of Scotland, ordered HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the traveling capacity and reduce the duration of poez for North England and Scotland.
This should include the opportunity to overcome the way from Glasgo and Edinburgh to London within three hours or less.
"Our objective for HS2 is to create a current national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other."
We develop HS2 because the benefits it brings are great.
Without him, we will face the crisis of transitional ability in our railway network.
But also about the transport of cities; throughout the United Kingdom, 18 cities, including Glasgo and Edinburgh, will receive a better message by HS2.
The Shotland Secretary Alister Carmackle added: “There is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Switzerland Government, Kit Brown invited Mr. Carmaycla to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-tree road has all opportunities to bring great economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for the high-economic railway road throughout the United Kingdom."
Therefore, we are pleased to work in partnership with the Government of the United Kingdom to consider the areas of the high-sized railway building in Scotland, the establishment of benefits for everyone and the continuation of Glasgo's railway line, Edinburg, which is already planned by the School Government.
I hope to consider the results of the study with the British Ministers during the year and the joint decisions on the steps.
Tory is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments in the countries of the world continue to think about how to ensure energy needs.
The burning of waters (where they are) negatively affects climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy is covered without and otherwise, but the rest of the mass of the delightful in the waste.
Recently, the scientists have noticed the second - another radioactive element of the Mendelejev system.
He is meeting throughout the world, and, as specialists have approved, his expansion will not remain in the losses to be maintained for age.
Rules for electronic aircrafts in Australia until it remains in force
The passengers of the Australian airports will also need to disable their plans and smartphones during the aircraft and station, despite measures in the United States for the reduction of device data.
The United States Federal Aviation Management allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, see videos or play play on their devices during the flight and station in order that they would stay in the Ravimo Airport.
The passengers can do this already during the main part of the flight, but many disturb that they have no access to their electronic books during the floor and the station.
Australian carriers consider this decision that the American aircraft company needed to carry out a large number of work in order to comply with new requirements, but indicated that they were not planning to change their procedures in the nearest future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they considered this statement, but stressed that the use of electronic devices in the critical phases of the aircraft remained in Australia.
“The civil aircraft safety management now does not have rules for regulating the use of electronic devices in the aircraft”, stated it.
The question is regulated by the rules required by the air carriers to ensure security maintaining at any time and by passengers to comply with the safety rules of the equipment members.
The Virgin company, who had already discussed the Civil Aviation Safety Office for Enhancement of the use on the board of its Wi-Fi dilution system, was not against changes, but stated that it would follow the ruler's orders.
"We would welcome reviewing the Civil Aviation Safety Office for the authorisation of the use of electronic devices, because we really think that it will improve the quality of customers' services now when it is on our plane," said the press secretary.
Qantas stated that those who are at the present time would be held.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices can't be used during the floor and station, and at the next time we're not planning to change it," she said.
The FAU is extended to American aircraft companies.
However, we are always interested in regular changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly consider carefully the FAU decision and the reasons that it has caused.
For the US carriers, the impact of the installation will be broken from the aviation company and depend on the age of their airport.
The carriers should prove that their aircraft is sustainable to mobile devices and revision of facilities, training materials, manual station standards and passports.
“When the aircraft will check and confirm the sustainability of its float, it may allow passengers to be able to be portable, electronic equipment, such as planches, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” said the FAU.
In rare cases, the emission will provide indications to passengers to disable their devices during the installation.
Furthermore, the group ' s recommendations should be deployed in sevens or in the seats of the baggage during the floor and the station.
The Chapter of Dagestan hears the extremism's notes in Cuban's middle
The football much between Angie and Cubanya was cast into a political collection between the authorities of the Cross-State and Dagestan after the hospitals burned the Dagestan flag, and the guin Cubani sounded differently.
The Chapter of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipo, on Thursday, proposed to the Response parliamentaries to return to the court, because the Hymn of the Crossnodar Country as if he would call for international differences, in particular, calls for war against "basurmans".
Take the Hymn of Krasnodar, this has been confirmed in 1995.
It's the same shame, and no one's doing this.
"Remembering you here as the mother of a family, on the basis of the basurmanin, we go to a battle" - that is why such words are to write in the gimn, to travel some of those who believe in other believers," he expressed solidarity with the Abdulati president of the parliament of Hizri Shichsaids.
Straightway, it was an unconsequence for his friend Asada
Now, it's news because of the ocean, that's from Syria, where, as we have been facing today, Israel's attack on the Russian production rackets, which, according to the reports, were designed "Hezbolle".
Today, Syria has fulfilled the importance - to make its production of the heat by 1 November.
This was made in the framework of the agreement, which was made in the media of Russia and which allowed the United States to not carry out military opponents to which they had entered in this year.
More details about the weapons and that all this means for the Syrian President, our main co-responsor Richard Angel will tell us.
Washington stated that Asa's regime would be punished for this.
More than 1400 peacemakers, including hundreds of children, have died in August from the gas-free gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the American bombs, but in the form of a transaction that a friend of Asada - Vladimir Putin built.
Syria will be rejected from its him’s weapons to the middle of the year.
And today's an important thing.
The Group of Experts reported that Syria has brought from the building stated chemotherapy factory.
The more long-term and harder task is to make the tone of the air and components to it.
As we understand, it's about a thousand tons.
Vasington said that Asa's days were counted before.
I think Asad should go.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when it will happen.
He's not anymore and he's got to go.
But Azad's staying.
And he feels more sure.
His army still uses artillery, rackets and napalms.
His opposers are dismissed and are badly armed.
His people have to leave their homes, many hunger.
Some have to eat with sheets and kitchens.
Many believe that Bashar Asad has avoided punishment for mass murder.
The arms agreement calls the success of the diploma, and the Nobel Prince of the world condemned them, and Azad himself made an impression of a person ready to cooperate.
Today, the United States staff in Syria had to answer direct questions in Washington.
When the child loses the famine, his mother is worth more than that he was killed by the him of the weapons.
Asad's still holding.
And he changes the weapons to power.
The President of the RF has established the Ministry of Construction and the ICH
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, created a new Ministry for building and JKH and proposed its ex-governmentary Governor of the Ivan area of Michail Menu in the process of personal meetings.
The Chairman met Michael Min in the residence in Novo-Ogareva, and Min refused to revoke the new adventure.

From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Menn was the Governor of the Ivan area.
The owners of the lombards in Singapore do well, while the medium class tries to be difficult
In a lombard in the trade center of Bendemir in Singapore Janny Amirhaling, the golden brushlet, the ring and the series are placed in order to pay school training to his daughter.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money are placed there," Mrs. Amirthaling says.
Although she is employing S$3000 ($2400) per month as a manager and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
In fact, the question in the various parts of South-Eastern Asia is where the debt of households is that ValueMax, where it is conducting its deal, at this week, the third lobby, registered on the Singapore Foundation.
It is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in case of Ms. Amirhaling), but almost the same thing as the unsecure bank credits.
In Singapore, generally, the rate of 17 per cent of the annual rate of the United Overseas Bank is more than 15,4 per cent of the creditor of the branch in the same trade center.
However, the lobbys have the advantage that they do not require creditability checks or proofs of the payment and may grant credits faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are in a lobby, since families feel a pressure because of the increase in life value and the rapid increase in the debt of households and consumer debt.
After five years of sustainable growth followed by the world financial crisis and the debt credits, the request for free monetary policy in developed economy countries, families with low and medium-sized income income in order to compensate the reduction of income as the growth of their economy.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency, showed an increase in the family credit box, mainly because of the growth of the hypoteque, as a risk factor for the risk of the creditability of the Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest relationship with households with a wheel internal product in Asia.
Malaysia highlighted this list with 80 % of the PIB compared to 60 % in 2008.
Economys have also been emphasised by a high level of consumer in Thailand, which has come out of the technical recession this week.
Thursday, data showed continuing reduction in the export and weakness of the consumer question.
“It is that, with the increase in human prices in the average and lower [income scales], they will seek ways to fill their incomes where they just go,” says the CIMB economy of the Malaysia bank, Song Seng Won.
Recorded high prices for gold in the past two years have strengthened the speed that people put on their own things, since they use the possibility of receiving money for their family currencies.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the materials set out in 200 lombards of the cities of the city, I'm made by gold.
The people say, "The golden grain looks good, let us put the golden cup of the grandmother and get it back in a month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney's largest lombard operator observed the increase in the number of customers used in the last months to 20 per cent.
The growth in a lower bishop is that ValueMax, the operator of Bendemire and 15 other in Singapore, plans to extend not only in the neighboring Malaysia, where he has four magazines, but also in the areas of Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, Executive Director ValueMax.
The company will expand by using 60 per cent of S$66 million in this week in order to place action on the Singapore Foundation.
While some creditors have made a fire of criticism because of high rates, Mrs. Jeah says that the lombard does not only make more low tariffs than other creditors, it also does not increase directly.
"Clients have the subjects they have already, and the mobilization of different assets does not increase the debt of households," she says.
The record is obliged to make more public recognition as a means of receiving a short-term deal.
It is not only the category of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
The rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax by putting golden clothes or Rolex hours, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase values.
We see clients from all the levels of society.
“They include a stated person who needs to take money for a short time for commercial projects or investments, or a small business undertaking, which must overcome temporary daily difficulties”, states Mrs. Jeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not important for the population to be a number of names and their status, but for the quality of medical assistance.
The implementation of the Programme for the Reformation of the Health of the Turkey for 2011-2013, allows the reorganisation of our city's medical resources to create a optimal structure for medical assistance to the population, including genealogic diseases, genealogic and birthdays.

During the implementation of the modernization programme, a substantial improvement of the material and technical base of the family home was apparently a modern equipment corresponding to world standards.
For these years, there were approximately 8 million rubbers for the capital reparation of the areas, which received 112 units of equipment for 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment constitutes an intensive post for newborn.
In the operation of the caesar of the caesar, the "Sell-Saver" equipment is used to collect blood from the operational ran and after special reference to its birthday, avoiding transfusion of extraterrestrial blood.
The modern equipment has also been identified by clinical-laboratory diagnosis.
In the women ' s consultation, the electronic register works, and the introduction of electronic cards and history of patients is quickly planned in the future.
The development of the media has been possible for consultation of geneological diseases, breeding, birthdays and newborn specialists.

Package of measures of 325 million for the health of Tasmania
The Federal Government insists that the package of rescue measures for $325 million for the sustained health system of Tasmania will be supplemented by serious conditions that guarantee that the Government will not take the means to be lost.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Community takes “temporary measures” to prevent the crisis of the older population of this island, a higher level of chronic diseases and systems.
The decision of the deputy was adopted after the Government ' s consultations with the independent Deputat of Tasmania Andrew Wilki.
"The prosecution has proposed a package of extreme rescue measures which, we believe, will resolve specific problems standing before the state," Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The pack of $325 million includes $31 million for a planning campaign.
Further 2600 operations, including ortopedia and disappearance operations, will help to overcome discharge.
There are also money for a clinic that takes hospitals without preliminary record in Hobart and London to increase the quality of login after the stationary, training of medical professionals, health protection services and the introduction of personal medical card systems in hospitals.
"These investments will come to the stated predecessors of ideas about how to help the Tasmanian health system," Mrs. Plibersek said.
The Minister claimed that the Government of Tasmania would work in a close report and responsibilities regime.
The State will need to support the current levels of deployment in order to receive the Community's money funds, and to consider each month where it will treat these additional funds.
The Commission of three persons will be established to ensure that the State provides services as more effective and more effective.
Mr. Wilky stated today that $325 million would not decide anything, "if they were not followed by a true reaction that would set the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable basis."
However, he thanked the Government for the answer to his request for urgent assistance that he first turned to the Prime Minister at beginning of May.
"I hope that the Federal Assistance Package will significantly contribute to the outcome of the health system of this state from critical status," said Mr. Wilki.
According to the State Government, these additional election procedures are significantly compensating recent reductions.
However, the Federal Opposition Representative for Healthcare Peter Datton believes that today's statement is a "decision, an analogue leacoplaster".
“The reason for which we are here is that the Government of the State has expelled $430 million from the health system,” he said the ABC TV TV.
When the State Government has almost half billion dollars and the Community contributes to 300 million, it is to conclude that it is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Mr. Pliberseck to ensure that no dollars from the package will be lost to additional bureaucracy.
The ecranization of Giom Nicole Romana Danny Didro can be exhaustive and historical details, but it is also more difficult than it should be.
The film, which occurs in France in 1760s, relates the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocratic, sent to his family's monastery.
When it begins to rebel, it is experienced by the extreme violence of the sadist-master and becomes an object of erotic taxis for others.
The film is never going to pass or sentences — and it is all the problem.
Because of its serious complaint, the report is risked to be an exam of the type of inscription and for the audience.
Syria has made its means of production of the him’s weapons, says the group's observation
Syria had the main equipment for the production of hymney and gas-free products, stated the international supervisory group on Thursday, while the emergencies were in the north of the country, nearly one of the objects where they believe that they were keeping it.
The Syrian activist group also stated that more than 120 000 people were killed from the beginning of the civil war in the country about three years ago.
The declaration of the Organization on the prohibition of the weapons was made for one day before
the final period of 1 November, which is established in the Gagaga Organization in order to "do not succeed" by Damask all means of production of hymney and mechanisms that allow the chemical arts to mix with the receipt of gas and to fill them.
The finality of what is at the main stage of the Implementation is a significant delight in the amber graph, which aims to make all the damaska arms up to the middle of 2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can't produce a new chemical weapons anymore.
Nevertheless, Damaskus is still going to be initiated by the Demanding Weapons and Reserves.
The country, as they believe, has approximately 1000 metrical tonnes of chemical arts and weapons, including bitter gas and nervous paralytic gas.
This statement was made during the wounded fights on Thursday in Safira, in which experts consider that there is an object for the production of hymney, as well as the place of its store, reported by the Syrian Centre for Human Rights in Britain.
The group of activists who followed the loss through the network of activists in Syria stated that 120 296 were killed on Thursday.
From that number, as stated, 61 067 I are civilians, including 6365 children.
From the Government, the group stated, 29 954 people I are members of the armed forces of President Bashar Asad, 18 678 I are managing fighters and 187 libanes of Hezbolla.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2202 military overseers and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to the United Nations evaluation of 25 July, 100 000 died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number wasn't updated from that pool.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee from the country.
Asada's army struck a few weeks in Saphira with rebels, many of whom are with the Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims from both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fights highlighted the danger of the inhibitors on the him’s weapons of their mission to deliver Syria from the tox of the arsenal to the continued civil war.
The OECHO statement, which works closely in cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “accomplied with the verification and monitoring of all of Syria's claimed materials and equipment critically important for mixing/modification”.
It added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
This week before, the In-Agency stated that they had completed the first checking course, visiting 21 of the 23 objects stated in Damascus.
They were not able to visit two places of security, and they declared the in.
On Thursday, OZHO stated that the two places were, according to the statement of Syria, “the objects of the arms programme in them were moved to other stated places that were checked”.
Could not find out whether there was one of the two objects in Safire who were not able to be visited by the OSH.
Syria had a plan to complete its arms, which should be held by the Executive Committee of the OHCHO for a month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you all have demonstrated in the implementation of the most complicated mission of this organization,” said the Director-General of the Supervisory Group of Ahmet Usumju in the commentary of the OECD.

What other events occur, the member of the Centre of Rami Abdurrahman said that it was a middle explosion on the PSO object in the neighbouring province of Syria Latvia.
The cause of explosion is not, he said.
Anger because of the conviction to the terrorists in Bali
The rest of living and 202 families who died by the explosion of bombs in Bali in 2002 in angerous response to the sentence, you are the last of the consequences presented before the court and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Pateque, who had run about 10 years of running, as one of the most researched people in South East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of freedom for his role in creating explosive devices used during the teraks.
It may be released for 15 years if it gets a term-term freedom.
The 45-year prosecutor was recognized as a guilty of mass murders due to an attack on two night clubs in the Pope tourist of Kuta, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australian people, and there were more decades.
It was also recognized as a guilty of a number of other persons with terrorist accusations, including in the dilution of the Church's explosions throughout Indonesia to the Canon of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors need a lifetime, although they could be determined that a person called “subsidy” for its reputation of the master for the manufacture of explosive devices should be sentenced to a penalty.
This decision has lost the painful memories of the mother from Perta June Cortin, who lost his 39-year-old Neighborhood daughters Jane and Jenny in the terak, about Pattek and his partners about ten years ago.
She almost holding the laughs said that Patek had to be sentenced to the punishment.
"I really think he must follow the steps of other guys.
He must be presented to the disturbing team,” Mrs. Cortin AAP said.
“I must live every day, knowing that I will have no more uncles and I will not see my daughters.”
Sarai's club was dissolved when the massive explosive device was carried out in the parking board after 11 night, 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the Paddy bar, where the terrorist shooted the fucking explosive, just 20 seconds ago.
After that, he fell into whom and “dead” three times a month, being connected to the life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share three other members of the terrorists of the Jema Islamic cell, responsible for the blood fight, Amroze, Muchlas and Hawaii, who were punished four years ago.
Actually, this guy deserves a punishing more than all.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to keep his life on him.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and hurt hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last of the terrorists in Bali before the court.
He was hidden for about ten years, but finally was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad, where the American army killed the former captain of Al-Qaida Usam Ben Laden less than four months later.
In the course of the court, the FBI agent showed that the information was witnessed: Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in trying to restore connections between the terrorist groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up," Mrs. Cortin said.
In recent times, he did not regret the hurt he caused others.
The sentence was made before the 10th year of the terak, which will be noted later in Bali and Australia.
"This year will be a lot of layer," says Mrs. Cortin.
Patek can still blame his sentence.
FAU: "Awasting passengers can now use aircraft boys (but not call from the phone)"
Aeroplanes are able to use their electronic devices throughout the aircraft to read, work, play in games, watch and listen, but not speak on mobile phones, a long-term new movement principles held on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Management.
But passengers should not expect that changes will be done immediately.
As soon as this change is made, it will be severely dependent on the aircraft, said the FAU manager Michael Warta at the press conference.
Aeroplanes should show the FAU how their aircraft is responsible to new rules and that they renew their training facilities for members of the Agency Equipment and the rules on equipment to comply with the new rules.
The FAU stated that it had already received plans from some aircraft companies to enhance the use of portable electronic devices in the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the aircraft companies that had already planned.
“When we are able to approve the extension of the use of electronic devices very quickly” said the FAU.
The passengers are currently binding to disable their smartphones, tables and other devices as the door of the airport is closed.
They should not restart them until the flight has a height of 10 000 foots and the captain will not give a ‘*’.
The passengers need to disable their devices again when the airplane is decreased, and not include them until the plane is on the ground.
In addition to new rules, aircraft companies whose aircrafts are appropriately protected from electronic mixtures may allow passengers to use and use these devices during the flight, station and rolling, the FAU stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircrafts that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at large heights, as it is expected, respond to these criteria.
Laura Glaying, President of the Association of Professional Boards, welcomed these changes.
“When the new policy will be well-wide (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to achieve it), it will be an unexpected option,” Glaying stated.
We have clearly insisted on feeling "dejur at school" when the matter comes to this issue.
The Agency reported that the connection to the Internet for the service, the exchange of electronic letters, text messages or data loading will still be prohibited at less than 10 000 feet.
The passengers will be proposed to change their smartphones, tables and other aircraft devices.
Thus, there is still no “Work with friends” — the intellectual Internet game in which Alex Bolduin played on his smartphone in 2011 when the case occurred: Actor was taken from the American Airlines Airlines Airlines aircraft for refusing to disable the device when the airport was located on the station.
And more difficult devices such as the nodebooks will still need to be placed in the baggage, because they can traumatise somebody if they are flying throughout the salon.
The phone calls in the airport will also be continued to be prohibited.
Regulatory powers on phone sounds belong to the Federal Committee on Connection, not FAU.
The FAU may be prohibited by some electronic devices during the emission and layout
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transport Security Council, the CBS News Safety National Expert, stated that phones are still considered as a risk.
"Home phones are actually a problem, not only because they can be able to create spaces for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCS that they can create mixtures for the overall of the center connection when the airplane is in the air," Rosenker said.
The Advisory Committee, established by the FAU for the study of this issue, recommended last month that the Government allow the use of personal electronic devices to be more broad.
In recent years, the FAU pressure has increased in order to reduce their use.
Criticals, such as the democratic Senator of Missouri Clerkaskil, claim that there are no public reasons for the prohibition of security.
The monitoring of the performance is also more difficult to ensure that the use of devices has become global.
In the study, the third passengers have forgotten or ignored their engines to disable their devices.
The FAU began to use electronic device passengers in 1966 in response to the communications on the mechanisms for navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry out FM radio recipients, high-technological garages at that time.
New aircrafts are much more dependent on electrical systems than on previous aircraft generations, but they also develop and approve the FAU as sustainable to electronic mixtures.
Aeroplanes have passengers using Wi-Fi in the creation height for several years.
Aircrafts modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more sustainable to mixtures.
The longer majority of the layers have been added to broader use of electronic devices with new rue principles, said Warta.
Today's electrical devices usually decrease radio signals much less power than the previous generation of devices.
Electronic book reading devices, for example, are excluded only for minimum signs when the pages are transferred.
But the signals become stronger when devices are threatened or linked.
Amazon.com was among those who had received a mixture for the use of electronic devices.
In 2011, the company's representatives charged the whole aircraft by their reading devices for children's e-books and flying on it to check the problems, but they did not find them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee have expressed mixed feelings as regards whether the application of devices is any risk.
Douglas Kidd from the National Airport Association stated that it considers the mixture of devices real, even if the risk is minimized.
Other members of the committee said that there was only a report of pilots that confirmed that the devices could create a mixture for aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAU allow pilots to require the passengers to disable devices during the installation under the conditions of spectacular visibility.
The group of tourist representatives of the industry welcomed these changes by calling them a healthy step to meet passengers now using technology devices.
"We are glad that the FAU admits that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with security and protection," said Roger Dou, Director-General of the United States Association.
Schools are able to conduct tests for the receipt of driver rights
Emissions on driver rights are likely to take private companies holding their own computerized car.
This is the "Commersant" which is a project of the Government ' about the management of vehicles '.
As the newspaper says, there are only 30 autodromes that are now in Russia.
The students of such "privilegated" cars are supposed to comply with the results of internal testing.
The Goslavto Inspection will also carry out monitoring each half-year tests.
If more than 30 per cent of the theory tests and more than 20 per cent of the students are not first given, this school will have no privileges for a half-year.
Technical requirements for autodromes contained in the Government's establishment project shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training of bicycle technology.
Since 1 January 2015, the owners of the moto for the rights of category A must be tested under the conditions of urban movement.
Furthermore, since 5 May 2014, the company will not be able to take foreign leaders with foreign rights.
These will have to receive Russian rights after the exam.
A bird broadcast in the air to a safe place from the northern Sea, returned to the wild nature
The bird broadcast on the air to the Âg after it was found in the east state of oil in the North Sea, was released back to wild nature.
This water shepherd was placed in a holiday held in Aberdin last month, and then the Scotland Implementation of the Community for the Prevention of Vital Treatment (SPCA) to the Alloa Centre.
Colin Seddon's center manager said, "This is the water shepherd, mostly, a winter migrant from the North Sea, which has fallen into the area of strong winds over the North Sea."
It seems that the bird was sown and smokeed to find a refuge on the oil height.
He added: "He was not able to flee again, so they turned to us for help."

The Business campaign for Britain has been launched in April with commitment to collecting business representatives and to determine what changes the creators of goods and slaves wanted to see in EU events.
For this purpose, we have ordered the largest and most full question of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the United Kingdom, the Business and the EU.
YouGov's company requested more than 1000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the United Kingdom on size, sectors and regions.
The results of the question will be unexpected for many.
We have discovered that the suspicious majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities by giving attention to the countries who have modernization and will be held while the EU countries are in the west.
They want the Government to grant priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to take time to reform the EU institutions.
When they were asked about their opinions on specific political issues, from anti-monopolal regulations to production laws, most business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
The general deficit was present to the single market, while the representatives of the business claimed that the expenditure from the regulation from Brussels now exceeded the benefits of the trade area, even 40 per cent of major enterprises, traditionally the most proef of all companies.
The most evident is that our interview of businessmen has shown that most of them wanted the United Kingdom to make a course for the change of the agreement and for trade with the EU, not for politics.
This result watched between all sizes and the largest business groups shows that the business is a significant change, which will return the power to the United Kingdom.
Higher rates are the achievement of amendments in the Treaty and more advantages for the United Kingdom will provide a 16-percent voting movement for remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this question shows that the British Business supports its plan of revision of the United Kingdom membership in the EU.
He also shows that business expects that revision will lead to a significant movement in the current balance of forces to the United Kingdom.
The best conditions for the British Business are and become more consistent as the Zone reaches a higher economic and financial union.
The priority should be given to the workplaces and economic growth in the United Kingdom, and, as the results of our enquiry, this means to enhance the focus of trade and the change in the regulatory activities of Brussels.

The Russian bank has released a memory banknote in the city of Sochi, where Olympian games are already going to pass.
Nominal buyers are 100 robbers.
But bloggers have already been actively ironised on the basis of memory banknotes.
Following the presentation of the Olympical Buyer on 30 October, they noted that the snowboardist's picture could be found in banks.
In particular, the free storage of StockExchange was dated in 2005.
The same graph is used in the Photoshop lesson listed on the Russian "Megaozor" website on 18 January 2011.
Moreover, it was already found in the Review of Smartphones RugGear.
The Olympian banknote has been carried out in a blue-golb gamma.
On the one hand, a snowboardist flying over Sochi is a species of olympical stadium and Jar-Ptica.
The designer of the banknotes is Paul Bushuev, who wins the competition among the students of the Sankt Peterburg Academia of Arts of the name of Repin.
The presentation noted that a number of species were considered to be a powder, a fresh, and a trampline, but the snowboard was finally chosen because it was a very young species.
According to the source of the "Education" that is close to the CB, the regulator does not consider the public's large distribution of the Snowboardist with the Olympian banknotes, and they are now studying the situation.
And this is not too comfortable in Goznaka with the brushing around the Olympian banknote.

According to experts, the debate on the Olympics Buyer and all.
The recognition of the buyer is plus for its movement, is considered the Executive Director of the NP "Rus Brand" Alexy Popolicev.
It is sufficiently difficult to demonstrate a hundred percent of images on the buyer and in the banks, so the desires to promote intellectual property for this image are to be done.
The first Olympics banknote appeared in China - to the Olympics game in Pekina in 2008 was issued in 10 Juan.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
The law prohibited the Russian to drink less bird
The Russian birds have bad advice.
Following them, the consumption of birds in the country in the future year remains at the previous level, and it is in the best case.
Although businessmen considered significantly growth.
Because the current year has failed: 7 percent sales.
All of this was the Chapter of one of the major birds companys of the country, president of the Council of the Russian Birds Isaak Sheps at the III annual Conference of the Institute of Adam Smith of the " Creators of the Daily Question in Russia", which just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed by the government of the market.
Since 2008 to 2012, the Russian bird market has been reduced to 18 per cent, since in the last years, the increase in the management of birds has been observed in the part of production and beverage drinking with a small alcohol content, shepherds reported to the listeners.
No one of the world has such harmful beer markets that have no predicted introduction of all new and new non-logical prohibitions that are based on the fight against alcohol abuse.
The writer visited that many legislation prohibited to decrease the alco-use level does not have any impact, however, all new initiatives are always present.
More sick by the producers of birds, the birds that have been introduced from this year have been prohibited to sell the cotton in the kiss.
"We have lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Chaps.
Two predicts for the next year in the birds.
Optimistic is the one of the Sheps said: The sales of pen drinks will be maintained at the previous level.
Pessimists will fall on 2-3 percent.
In order to maintain their arrival, businessmen have to get out of the mass-consumer debts to the "premium" class: the beer will be less, but it will be worth more.
Instead, radical consequences from the fall of the sale with a small quantity of the spider are not yet seen.

In September, 600 people were released from the Ford Car in the University.
As they say in the promotions, all of the volunteers have received compensation.
However, more stressful than the problems of slaves is the question of reducing production in the region.
The Deputy of the Regional Zacsa Alexy Etmanov at the meeting stated that the Ford company in the University was reduced by 600 people.
According to his statement, this occurred in September, then, by a voluntary freedom program, which was held together with the organization, about 600 persons were departed from the campaign.
Workers who decided to release their own will have been proposed for " gold parachutes" in various areas.
Because of this, most of the deceiting majority have abandoned the workers of their own will.
However, Ethman's statement, such a number of people is a whole night change.
I don't think that's going to happen.
However, the authorities are not planning to adopt any programme of support for regional undertakings in the difficult situation," he explained, adding that the Government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction of slaves.
Ford doesn't repeat or confirm this information.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and, as soon as it appears, we'll have to put it up.
Conversations on the reduction of slaves in Ford's Ford in the University have been delayed for a long time.
So, for example, the company's plans to release 600 people were still in September.

Furthermore, aircrafts should convince the federal administration of the United States civil aviation that they are able to cope with the proposed effect of mobile aircraft and aircraft management.
This source, such as the United States, will also be revised in Britain.
For the "Russian Mafia" in the United States, the new name is "Bratski Circle"
This week the black list of Russian mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Financial Ministry introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israel.
One of the Russians was a song of Grigory Leps, which understood the transfer of money for members of grouping.
However, in the United States black list 22 persons participating in the Branch Circle, and six organizations associated with him.
However, many experts are doubting that this is actually existing.
"The statement of the Broadcast Circle" is more trying to join different crimes," said an expert on organised crime and Professor of the University of New York Mark Galeotti before.
His opinion, "Bratski Circle" reflects the popular "Russian Mafia".
"I didn't meet anybody in Russian legal authorities or anywhere else who would confirm that such crime organization," cited Mr. Galeothy, the American Center for the Research of Corruption and Organizational Crime.
With Mr. Galeothy and Professor of the University of George Mason Liz Shelley.
"If they and the community are increasingly like a criminal network, but not an organism," it states the Corruption Research Centre and Organized Crime.
In the middle of the past year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Bratski Circle" is increasingly closer to the Russian war in the Law of Aslana Usoyan, as Ded Hasan.
The criminal authority was killed in January this year.
Yes, the activity of Lashi Shushanshvili and Zachary Kalashov, full of the list in 2012, was close with Ded Hassan, and another part of the Spanish, Themury Myrzoev, was the father of Hassan.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some persons do not have any of Usians.
He believed that all of them had been united in more common financial and crimes of interest, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Among them, the scandal in the Bratski Circle of the Gregory Leps, the favorite song of President of Russia Vladimir Pu, took the attention of Kreml.
Of course, we consider that we will receive more information from our American partners about why it was taken in such a case, said the press secretary of the Chapter of the State of Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a CF citizen.
Like the interests of all RF citizens, his interests will be protected.

Two YMCAs have been accused of sexual crimes before accusations against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission had been sentenced
Two YMCA NSWs have been accused of sexual crimes against children before the execution of accusations in 2011 against the Child Insurance Institute in Caringbach Jonathan Lord, reported the King's Commission on Sex Violence against Children.
However, in the introductory statement of the Commission, it was said that “never had sexual violence against children within her organization”.
The Chief Executive Director Philippe Hayra asked on one occasion when the YMCA was accused of crimes of the pornography, and otherwise, when the sports officer in YMCA Caringbah Hall was sentenced for sexual crime against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayer told Gail Fernes, who showed the Commission assistance that he knew about the first case, but didn't know about the second.
He admitted that YMCA also allowed the Commission's incoming case an inefficiency, saying that " YMCA's external checks were recognized that YMCA is in the first lines for children's security".
The witnessing Commissions have said that the YMCA was notified that it had received the second of the four of the results of the quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hayer, who entered the YMCA, when he was 21, admitted that he and the underlying leadership had been allowed to dismiss by Lord and could not provide a clear understanding of the staff of his commitments, a report on the violations of the child's security policy.
Lord was sentenced for sexual crime against 12 boys during two years of his work at YMCA.
He was arrested at least six years.
But Mr. Hayer refused the opinion that the YMCA corporate ethics had interrupted the reporting of Lord's distortions in the field of children's security.
The co-operators showed that they had observed the disturbances, including that Lord was the only one with the children, cared for them personally, seized them on the knees, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his phone.
Daniel Okvell, who was under Lord's leadership and asked her to teach the protection of her children, because she was comforted by his behavior, witnessed that Jackie Barnat, the guardian of YMCA's children in Caringbah, was “a very terrible and often difficult to be available”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the explanations of the fact that they were not to report the situation to their high-leaving persons.
Their friendship with Lord soon led them from the idea of the need to report about him.
Mr. Hayer said that he had made the YMCA Council of the New South Wales its opinion that a lesson for the organization from the "currentship with Jonathan Lord" was not "submitting information" from the parties, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hayer stated that the decision to subscribe the confidentiality agreement after the accusation was adopted by the Director-General YMCA on the protection of the children of Liam Witley.
He said that it was called to prevent the proof of the facts, but that was “overcome” and that was the wrong decision.
YMCA of the New South Wales was not safe for the children of the organization during the work of Jonathan Lord in 2009-2011, reporting the expert Commission on the problems of the child's child Professor Steven Smallbone from the University of Griffith.
He said that there were “serious problems” in the setting, election, and employment, training and control of the staff.
The commitments have been repealed until 20 December.

Tony Blair said he'd be hoped for a chance to return as a British Prime Minister, but he admits that the return is unlikely.

Look at Jaka, who held a meeting at high level.
Experts of Connoporting activities that go to Cardiff to fight for the "Agenda's Breakfast" came to know that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready to appear at the three-year-old Penton of Kirkland.
Not even a schoolman, but just a few months before this, that little boy with his scepter, Toffy's pool, was thrown through three hours to easily take the main premises, and left 30 adults away behind.
This unseparable couple, the same growth, has received high extent, behavior and style on an annual competition, which is conducted by the centre of Sannibenk’s horse in Radry near Cardiff.
When he went out to the overall surprise on the background of men and women in the bullets, he throwned his pile and horded around the two-year Toffy.
The Courts praised Fenton for his no longer developed ability to treat the ships for years.
And Toffy got a higher Property for the outer look and character.
Phenton was given to Tophy on his third birthday in March last year, and he was working with the Switzerland Pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Tophy are a duate."
They had a lot of coppers, but these two went out with the golden cube and the wheat.
It was just his second statement with Tophy, and we were all at the point when he won.
Perfectly known people in the arenna believed that he was so phenomena that they wanted to photograph him.
This boy from the village of Nantigo, near Abb Wayle in South Wales, and by his grandfather Sharon Howels, who has made a lobby for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, "All the P's been wounded, and they were all able to approve the votes and votes."
He fled through the sand throughout the whole length of the aran, and, although he looked so small, he did his business.
Fenton without animals — he loves bowls, tractors and farms, and he has two circles that he forgets.
As he judged how he started, he would have already participated in the "Loshadi of the Year" - and I am sure he's going to do good.
The representative of this annual exhibition said, "Fenton is only three years, but he knows how to handle his pony."
But they're a different team.
The judges noted Penton and Toffy for their external aspects and how they had been on the market show.
They appreciate the compatibility of the pony and the leader — Phenton and Toffy were better on the market.
I'm sure Phenton's helped his attractive order, he really looked well in his role.

According to Savills' investigation, the prices in the centre of London continued to demonstrate a sustainable growth of 5.6 per cent in the year calculation, but they were actively developing the “othermark” with a comprehensive price in the southwest, north-western (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have made light on how the movement of the dog's wheat is with her advice.
More early studies showed that the dogs are swimming to the right (with the view of the dogs), while the affected dogs swimming in the left.
However, scientists now say that other representatives of the family of dogs can note these extreme differences in the wheel and respond to them.
Professor George Vallortigar, neurobiologist from the Trentic University, says: “Hor ́o is that people have the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in the forming of builders that call you or reject emotion.”
Here we tried to look at this and other kinds of things.
He added that as humans, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and the opposite, and two halfs play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how the dogs reacted to various side effects of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of the heart of animals and analysis of their behavior.
Probably soon we'll see why their weights are sometimes moved to one side and sometimes to another.
Professor Vallortigar said, "We showed the dogs videos with dogs, or naturalist versions, or potential, to be released from any other fashioning factors, and we could manipulate the motion of the hair and drive the weight more left or right."
When the animals saw that there was nothing to say that the dog was moved to the right (with the view of the wheat of the dog), they remained completely satisfied.
But when they noticed that the wheat was slow down at the left (snaps from the snow of the bullet of the dog), their hearts were part of and they looked as anxious.
Professor Vallortigar said he didn't think the dogs were communicated with each other with these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience of the movements they should be careful and not.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often the wheat of them in one hand with more friendly behavior and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give the owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal emotions.
The expert in the conduct of John Bradshaw, who was invited by a scientist at the British University's Veterinary School, said that it was not the first investigation to check whether it was important for dogs on the left and right side.
In the past year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln discovered that dogs turn to the left if they look at an aggressive dog and right if they look at a long dog.
And at the other Scientific University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “The dogs are more frequently understood to the dog-work when the wheat was moved to the left, not right, rather than to become anxious, is the opposite behavior of the Italian investigation.”
He said that the differences could be because dogs in different studies did not completely recognize animals in films or dogs as dogs.
He explained that it could be an investigation of how the dogs respond to the actual dogs.
"When there are sufficient evidence of that two half-might brain is used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified and dogs are not excluded," he said.
However, taking into account the facility that may be registered, we will probably soon realize why their weights are sometimes moved to one side and sometimes to another.

Pope Francesco will call the first cardinal in February
Pope Francesco brings new cardinal catholics to the Church first for his service on February 22, as he declared on Thursday Vatican.
Cardinales I'm the highest spirituality in the Catholic Church after Pope, and they're just choosing papa, so Francesco's first group of people who will finally participate in the election of his recipient.
Now there's 201 cardinal.
However, after a 80-year-old cardinale, he can no longer participate in the dad's elections, it is a prerogative group of 120 "cardinals-electors".
By announcing this news, the press secretary of Vatican, Father Federico Lombardy, said that before the ceremony of transfer to son, the congregation of all current cardinals will be held as a consistent.
"Papa Francesc decided to report his decision to make a consist in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the part of the cardinal from different angles of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero, from the Catholic Voices Organization, said that the number of cardinals-electors will probably be reduced to February.
He said that the dad usually calls so many cardinals as necessary to restore the number of cardinal electors to 120, as well as the number of cardinals in the age of 80 years as he wants.
The Consistency will have a great importance in the year ' s year, since it will be the first of the French election in March this year, according to Valero.
At this time, it is a kind of prejudice to the benefit of it, and especially for Italy.
“I would be interested in seeing whether a new cardinal father in other regions of the world will be designed to restore the balance,” he noted.
In South America, forty percent of Catholics are residents, but they are represented as no number of cardinals.
These will also be the first chosen cardinals since the French Cardinals Council, groups of eight cardinals from the world, who are ordered to seek ways to reform the Church.
In the past, my dad's decision was self-determined.
"Now Francesc has chosen eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it would be "completely possible" that Francesco would take care of the advice.
But we weren't in such a situation before that, all this is for us first.
Valero said that dads were usually leading to the cardinale of episcopes from major income, but the French “Polons of surprises — so we don't know who he's calling”.
GM reacts to a number of new pick-ups in the United States for the seat-up
General Motors Co replies to nearly 19 thousand completely new chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra model 2014 to remove the problems with the manual regulatory decline of the seats, in the reported on Friday by the U.S. regulatory authorities in the field of transport security.
Some of the picappes may have a defect in the breeding mechanism.
As a result, the seats are not conform to the federal standards for the transport of carryers.
“Before the car attack, the walker may not protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of receipt of traumatisms”, stated on the website of the National Road Safety Administration.
The repeated models were made from 1 August to 10 September.
The GM picappes started in June and represented the most important car rental in the serial production for the leading American car manufacturer since his replacement on account of the bankroot in 2009.
GM reported to the picaps owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Travel Safety Administration could not consider the notice to the owners of the 16-day interruption of the Government, which reduced the sale of car in October.
Sales of silverado and Sierra, modernized for the 2014 model series, increased by approximately 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 picappes Silverado and 16 503 picape Sierra.
The GM action on the New York Fund on Friday increased by 1.4 per cent before the marking of $37.47.
Depreciation of Obama's electoral claim
I voted for the President of Obama twice, dividing the hope of amendments
He stated that Obama had allowed the ability of the resistanceism to commit no effort.
The environmentalism cannot be addressed by the issues of the Reformed Reformed Health System, the attacks of pilots
Memories on the campaign of Obama 2008 I have been reminded of what could be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second school student of the Harvard University.
I'm reading a horrible book in these days.
I'm saying that this book will encourage me at the second course of the medical faculty and bring me a feeling of hope.
It is called “Feedback” and it is a memory of the Presidency campaign of Barak Obama 2008.
When I finish writing reports on my patients tonight and I lie into bed, this book returns me when politics inspired millions of people, and the expressions could take a spirit.
Victory on the elections of an emergency, and the leading news programmes made a pause to consider this historical moment.
My classmates were weeping from joy, and my parents had all the newspapers they could only find.
The white House had to come to the young team of the teams, and the people were ready to change.
During the entry in Obama in 2008, its support level was 82 %.
Then I'll close the book.
The revenge is now a deep wake as a deterioration of minds.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a remote memory, anxious reminder of the unexpected opportunities.
For years since I left my first electoral bulletin, changes really happened.
That was what I couldn't even do.
I grant Obama its great and different achievements, from the adoption of the law on available medical assistance to the outcome of our military soldiers from Iraq, the cancellation of the rule "Do not ask," the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the partial scope of blocking is too much attempts to move our country in front: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and closing the base in Guantanamo among others.
But after an innumerable number of times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting it from colleagues and companions, I had completed the explainings I could deliver.
I've reached the political point of disappointment.
The Ombudsman's resistanceism cannot explain the authorisation to listen to foreign leaders or to bring appeal to unfaithful persons in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of the Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of disfellowshipped persons who discover the unlawful acts of the Government.
He cannot explain the murder of the American citizen Anvar al-Aulaki without a court and a consequence or unconsciousness of the limits of public employment and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justifie the conclusions of the report, in which it states that the examples of the White House in order to put MMEs in silence me are “unique aggressive... since Nixon's administration.”
And at the last time, he cannot justifie that it is not able to describe the simple website for more than three years after signing the Medical Assistant Act.
I don't know if I had to wait for that.
Did I have 18 years of age to understand that the leadership could oppose the political campaigns that he had before?
It is obvious that the work at the election is not a predicted programme of employment, since our public dialogue will be formed by a oppositional political party and the case-related events such as the fear of Newtown.
Nevertheless, the above examples of I have shown that they were a major choice of the administration.
And that's what's worried about me most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was filled with an enthusiasm in the course of his candidate.
Our Romany was an incomprehensive and cruel alternative, and it seemed that he was not able to make decisions on its own policy or opinions.
I believed that in my second time Obama, being released from the pressure of the future elections, has justified the hopes we have heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating was lower than 45 per cent in this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008 through this book.
This makes me look at many promises that have been flying.
This week I read the part of the book, in which it is described as Clinton had caused Obama a cruel distress on early elections in Pen-Vani.
At an analysis of the reasons of failure, he said to his responsibility that they should return to the normal round and remain faithful to their goals.
“I want us to get back -- we're attractive, ” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years ago, Mr. President, and I'm perfectly able to do with you.
The comments expressed in this comment belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer approves that Tony Abbot's deputy has a conflict of interests in the deputy for a child's deputy.
Deputat billioner Clive Palmer says that the Premier Ministry of Tony Abbot has a conflict of interest in a child's release, because his daughters can be replaced by this benefit.
It has made this statement when he tried to dismiss questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer ' s single party may control up to four votes in the senate, which may be determined to make decisions on the cancellation of emissions in the country and on the high-term activity.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interests could be only with the ministers, and said that Mr. Abbot's daughters would be able to win political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interests when the relief and responsibility of the payable remission to the child is payable, because if any of these daughters is entitled, he will have a direct interest in whether they will receive a remission or not," Mr. Palmer said.
During two months after election, the election committee officially announced Mr. Palmer to the winner in combating the place of the electoral district of Sanshain-Cost, with a overview of 53 votes after the vote.
Mr. Palmer invited the review of the procedure of the votes on elections for the implementation of this process.
Tony Abbot Francis and Bridget's daughter.
Should these elections be taken within two months after we have voted?
"We must have a more complex system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have such a system so that we can come, enter our data into the computer, speak and get the result at 18:30 at the same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of the carands for bookmarks in bulletins.
It's because they can keep the result if he doesn't like someone?
And to use the karandas in our time.
The Election Committee is conducted in the study of ✔ for electronic vote and recently repeated the joint debate document with the New Z India.
The 59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme includes the airport for Sanshain-Cost, and he will be "very serious to its new employment.
State office provides the service of society.
"We do not receive any reward except the gratitude of the story, because we can serve this area at a critical moment," he said.
RBS removes two currency triggers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily removed from the work of two triggers in its currency division, the information of two persons known to the situation, which is another subject to the fact that the global check of regulators on the currency market is strictly eligible.
The largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in research with the world's largest financial market, which is $5,3 million per day.
These two triggers will be the first RBS, removed in the course of a developing investigation, which is called to the scandal with interbancational LIBOR manipulation.
Rejecting the removal, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for the provision of information from the regulatory bodies in this month.
"Our current investigation of this issue continues, and we have completely cooperated with FCA and other regulators," reported the bank two weeks ago.
In the past month, the notifieds said that the RBS had transmitted the records of the email and instant messages that had received and sent its former third party to the Governing Board of the United Kingdom, the Financial Action Office (FCA).
This third party, Richard Asher, went out of the RBS in 2010 and, as far as it was, has been granted to him a repayment at his current position by the Officer of the JPMorgan Contracting Monetary Trade.
Rohan Ramchandani, the manager of the Peace Trade Commerce in Citi, went to department this week, while Me Gardiner, the former Value Treider in Barclays and UBS, was removed from the work by the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
No of these triggers was accused of any offences.
The group of contacts of Mr. Asser included banks from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the statements of the persons notified.
The UBS bank reported this week that he adopted measures against some of his owners after the Swiss regulator Finma said that he investigated the proposed manipulations on the monetary market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies in the world — the Commission, Finma, the Swiss Weko, FCA, the United States Justice Minister and the Hong Kong Value – consider the fact that banks have entered into a negotiation on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests to provide information from the regulatory bodies, known as the situation.
The banks are looking forwards and e-mails for several years in seeking cases of crimes.
The news on checks has been reported to triggers in the field of activities that I have made in recent years one of the largest sources of income income in investment banks, which, however, have been confronted with difficulties in this year because the low volatility is decreasing the opportunities for sales.
Bankers have tried to undermine the seriousness of the situation, saying that the large and highly balanced market is practically not manipulating, but the older treaders say that it is not always true.
According to the older treider, despite the large volume of daily market markets, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trades and larger use by banks of their internal forms means that “you can begin to affect the market at a very small price”.
This news came on the same day when the Credit Suisse bank announced that he had released one of his treaders in London's markets at the end of the year after he had caused a debt of approximately 6 million dollars.
Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
"We are sure that the treader has been single and that this question has been able to locate," Credit Suisse reported.
The Supreme Court supported the Obama ' s law on health protection
The United States Supreme Court today stated that Barak Obama's signal law on health protection is constitutive, which is a major victory of Obama's administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges claimed that from the way of the provisions of the Patience Law on the Protection and the Available Health Protection required by the citizens to receive medical insurance until 2014 or pay a loan, I are constitutive in accordance with the powers of the Government on the tax charge.
The President of the High Court John Roberts joined four more liberal members of the court while judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also left the rest of the sections of this 2700-page law and stressed that the requirement of health protection law to increase the requirements of the Medicaid programme, Otherwise they lose all the federal implementation of the Medicaid programme, is not unconstituted.
The claim to block the legislative project has introduced 26 states and the National Federation of independent business.
On the contrary of the law, each of the main república candidates in the president during the 2012 first election season, including the proposed candidate Mi · Romani.
Football is the reason of different?
Policy and experts in the "Open Court" were discussed in the House about how to maintain the national world in Russia.
In the middle of the proposals, it was also: prohibiting the football on North Kawkaz, because the game is one scandal and divorce.
Spiker Sergei Nariskin on the recent events in Beryl said that policy and MME should be correct in statements to decrease the "degree of pressure in the community".
He's probably meaning a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinski, who in one of the teletranslators threatened to surround Kawkaz with a bullet, if there's no chance to make birthability...
All speakers were also talking about the measures to regulate migration from the NGO countries, and about the harmonisation measures between the peoples of Russia, which added to the debate of confusion.
The Gregorjew said that the events in Beroul were the "model conflict that could be predicted", but "for these questions we have too many people and institutions," and seven young children have no eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism, which long-term migrants had been involved in the public, has been lost and needed to look for his way.
The history of Yuri Petrov made great hopes for a new historian teacher.
"And we need to create a share in the history of the country's culture so that schoolers in Tatarstan know that people will be in Dagestan, and in turn," he reported.
Gennadi Zhuganov proposed to introduce a voting responsibility for "the calls for Russia's discharge": "If the United States say by the radio that the Alaska Russia must be given, you will be arrested and will give you 20 years of age!"
Vladimir Zirinski was very trying to not burn.
How usually, he accused journalists who are in a public debate, "What is little to say in the field?"
The Leader of the Fraction "Single Russia" Vladimir Va's advised the journalists to conclude the "cart" and to agree with the news on this subject, and then the same commitments can be taken on themselves and on politics.
We have adopted approximately 30 laws that regulate the migration, and the general settlement, Mr. Va.
As an example, he introduced the law which is imposed on the region and the municipality of the authorities to be responsible for the international peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andricanco did not divide the obstacles of this law: there are no " clear ideas of the adjustment of migrants, its mechanisms and divisions.
So, the subjects will treat a different volume of these powers.
Furthermore, the Municipality munity has no frames that are available to solve such complex issues, there are no means, and the methodical recommendations they could use are not given to them...
The Chapter of the Nationality Committee, Hadjimet Saharaliev, proposed to establish a special campaign called the National Security Ministership, which would be involved in national policies.
But Valerius Tyschkov, who was a similar advice in the 1990s, was opposed.
It is sufficient to have at the federal level of a special person, a " Minister without a portfolio" to which it could be returned if something.
"We, on the other hand, have a very important role for the representatives of different ethnic and religious religions to act together against provocations, and this work must receive a valuable instruction support," said the Representative of the CAP on relations with the University of Chaplin.
No neutrality of the State in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious, should be, in its opinion,.
Here, Oleg Nelov made a discussion in an unexpected road: "More talenting people than in Checce or Dagestan need to be searched, but they are not on the way, not on the road," he said.
"Not the way" is the development of the football: "The footballists shoot the whole crowd, then the flags burn, so the companions of stones raise one another...
Maybe we don't need that football?
There's another kind of-- the regby is called...
"They will not be in the world in this way!", said the rawross bitterly.
There's no one going to play in the Caucas!
You're still giving them a driver!
We need to know the national characteristics, it's still the same as the "Zoomer" weight to offer"...
The representatives of the Moscow Club were different in Jaroslavla during the game with a club.
Football's going to be prohibited throughout the country...
The Chapter of the Control Disciplinary Committee of the RFS Arthur Grigorianz reported that Cuban was traffed to 500 thousand rubles, transmitted from the House of the Football Correspondence of the Philipp PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions for the rednodar club are applied to the Dagestan flag under fire by the tribe diseases during the 14th tour against Angie.
The meeting was representative of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We are investigating all the materials that have.
For the unlawful behavior of Cuban's viewers, it was 500 thousand rubles.

A group who would possess thousands of Nortel patents was giving a whole series of patents against phone manufacturers, including the Google company, whose price it had overtaken on the Nortel bankrot.
Consorcium Rockstar buying $4.5 billion of Nortel patents has provided requests for the derogation of patent rights in the United States Court of the Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.

Rockstar requires an increased remuneration from Google, since he claims that the distortion of patent rights from Google is a mental, crucial demand.
In Egypt, the first freely chosen president is voted
Muhammed Mursy is a swearing, but the day of his complaint is likely to be the end of the political fight in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mushammed Mursi promised the "new Egypt" when he made a swear, he became the first freely chosen president of the country, changing Hossie Mubarak, who was 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the High Constitutional Court of Justice, Morsey also was the first islamist president of the Arab peace and the fifth Chair of the State in Egypt after the execution of monovia about 60 years ago.
He adopted a decree before 18 judges in black mantiahs in the court of Nile, built in the style of ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are seeking the best future, the new Egypt and the second resistance," said Mursi during the competitive ceremonie shown directly on public television.
“The Egyptian people set the foundations of a new life — absolute freedom, authentic democracy and stability, ” said Morsey, a 60-year-old engineer with a American education from Brother Muslims, a bundamental group, which was most of the 84 years of its employment, a prohibited organization that served as a mixed for a heavy change and other governments.
Cent soldiers and police were protected when Murssie came with a small shortage after 11th morning.
Only a few hundred parties were gathered in the opinion of the court to welcome the new president, and, in contrast with the presidential time of Mubarak, the movement was stopped for a short time to lose its car column on the usually survived road, which is the center of the city with the southern villages.
Although Mursy had laughed as a non-haris as a “reserve road” of the brothers, his personal pressure was strictly grown since his winning and fifthing statement, in which he tried to act as a candidate not only as islamists, but also those who wanted to end up to the 2011 Resurrection of the Authorist Mubarak.
“He is Egypt’s civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Morsi, who was dressed in blue with red glass, judges in the overall tree panels of the village where he had made a swear.
Morsi later went to the Cairo University, where he had to make his inaugurational claim.
He was officially accepted with an army orchestral, which was carried out by the State Guinea, during which he stood on the “small”.
There was a military worker of Feldmarshall Husein Tantavi.
His arrival was met by the Army and the people, one hand, which has been assembled in the main lectory room of the University.
Based in 1908 as a World Education Place, the Cairo University in the 1970s of Islamist Student Groups .
Mursi adopted a symbolic sworn on Friday on the Tachir area, where the resurrected statement of Mubarak's Authority Government in the past year, and promised to return the responsibility of the President whose responsibility was denied by the military adviser who had taken the cases from the duty of the leader.
But by agreeing to adopt an official prosecution before the court, not before Parliament, as adopted, he exercises the will of the military, and it is a sign that the fight against the authority will continue.
The word of Morsey on the Tachir area was filled with theatralistic polytheists.
The specific set of the Association of Germany’s cars was based on the Jalutor’s car rental.
A new line on the production of electro-screen tubes has been presented in the framework of the activities.
According to the commercial director of Denise Grybanov, the marketing investigation on the market was conducted in 2011 with a new owner.
It was found that the region needs more than 50,000 tonnes of electrical tubes per month.
Thereafter, it was decided to change the profile and install equipment on it for their production.
More than 7 thousand tonnes of production produced in this year.
The investment in the ship was more than 120 million rub-lays, - said Dennis Grybanov.
In October, a new section is launched, which allows increased assortiment.
It is released as a small tube profile that is used for heat-personal household, small forms of building and mobile industry, as well as large for building growth.
We are planning to exit the production level of 50,000 tonnes per year, which consists of approximately 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tunisia.
Despite moving to another type of activities, the number of enterprises has not been reduced - it now includes 157 persons, in plans for the purchasing of new equipment - the increase of the staff is more than 50.
In the undertakings and restructuring of frames, specialists are already chosen from name.
In the future year, a new long-term aggregate is planned to be extended to five millimeters, allowing it to reduce self-depreciation of the production, and another, with the speed of the tube to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the enterprises are going to gain the exhibition of the tubes used in the housing and community.
The undertaking has the task to close up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Dumping area in this product.
The director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Islands, referring to the manufacturers, recommended to give greater attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also the forms of public support for industry, including the payment of credit rates for the purchasing of new equipment and liabilities.
In this year, 150 million rubbers were intended to determine these objectives, and two thirds of this amount have already been determined.
After the Commission, which will consider subsidiarity contracts, takes documents from undertakings to 15 November.
Furthermore, the budget is payable for the participation of producers in the jailmarks.
For the future budget year, the amount of 150 million rubbles can be used for the compensation of license and credits for new equipment.
5 million will be involved in the jammers, 3 million to the energy programme.
It is decreased to 72 million resources for the remuneration of the ordered and paid equipment in the south of the German area for petroleum complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, this support will be suspended in the perpetuity, since its introduction was the motivation of compensation for the acquisition of oil companies, which were paid in the regional budget.
They do not do so now, and subsidies become the primary cost commitments of the region.
In view of this area, the Government considers the direct support of industrial undertakings, not the operation of petroleum growth through them.
The budgetary assistance will be with investment projects that will be made on production.
Many enterprises expressed anxiety about the complex situation of petroleums.
The contribution to their purchased equipment is the competitive advantage of the industries of the south-Thumenian area, and it will be difficult to take place in the price of the average Russian staff, where a more lower robbery force.
Furthermore, an unclean question with the presence of the new owner of the TNC-RR, a company of Rosnefth, which has not yet placed its orders on prison enterprises.
The Agreement on the Implementation of the Uvat Project is concluded in 2013, and the applications for its prolongation have not been achieved.
Currently, the South areas specialised for the oil sector can not form a portfolio for the future year.
The question remains open to whether taxes from the oil delivered in the Uvat region will be made to the region's budget or will be paid for the registration of the new owner of the locations.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Nicolai Asarov has assured that prices in the country will be significantly reduced after the country will sign an Association Agreement with the Union.
That was what he stated in communicating with the readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including payments.
Thus, after signing the agreement and entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the level of the imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that will mean that the prices should also be reduced.
"This is the case of goods that progress from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
Whatever other goods are deceived, the impact of the price agreement will not be such a burden, and it will be justified.
However, there should not be any increase in prices.
Thus, the reports on the campaigns that recently appeared enough in our country that association with the EU is a growth of prices, it is not exactly, or if it is more precise to say, it is not exactly true," - Azar's summary.

After the accusation of the foolish wedding, the chair was sentenced
A person who has approximately been given to the SMV, has no comment on a number of pressing in the Minor Defence and on a personal person with an ex-minist of the Defence of Anatolia, the Poesia and the Privacy of Privacy.
However, on 1 November, the "Defenseervise" figure has disappointed silence.
Life News Va's interview stated, "It was clearly one: to bring any negative information from me on the former Defence Minister."
There was a chance for the subject that I had to testify, Otherwise I'll be seated.
These threats have been suspended today.
We're going to the court further, we'll prove our innocentity.
We are sure of 100 percent of the winner.
In this way, the interview can conclude that most of the best of the Va have said that it is not important to be cut.
It is probably a statement of the official representative of the CC RF Vladimir Markin that in the collection of the images that the " Defenseervis" case figures were found.
In the middle of the arrested property, there are a number of pictures that the lady, being convinced in his deep knowledge of the world's livelihographs, received as leaders.
However, the experimental expert, appointed by investigators after the arrest of these images, established that they had no artificial value and that I simply was being involved in the ships," said Markin at the beginning of October.
Some pictures stolen by the Defence Minister...
Then they recognized that they were not stolen from Mino Defense, and they said I was wrong with the cuss.
Who has the right to discuss my cousin and discuss some different moments?
I think it's just a disappointment," says Va'eva.
The question is whether she recognises its fault at least in one of the 12 crime episodes that she had been changed, and the Waeva said, "No, naturally, no.
Recognizing nothing.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation to say.
They're just putting people into an error, all right?
Furthermore, in response to today's statement of the CC RF that Va ́eva was removed from studying the matter of voting materials, the figure claimed that he and his customer "is not allowed to be familiar with the materials of the matter".
What was the cause of revelations under the home arrest of Va’a, which has not been associated with the pressure?
Maybe how did a woman not have to respond to an accusation in a bad dog?
Or the right journalist Comsomolki, who said a few days ago that she had "increased a great cross under home arrest" because of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdjukov with her wife and his return to the family's lone?
The known military overview of the "KP" Victor Baranek in its article "Serdukov returned to the woman?" wrote, "The followers do not exclude that after that, she could be more able to be on the investigations."
Earlier, a number of accusations in the illegal sale of the minor property of the Mino Defence took place.

Dmitrium Medvedev: The growth of the WTO RF is not sufficient for the development of the State
The Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers that it is inadequate for RF to increase its PIB and that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions of business credit and changing the Russian economy structure by orienting the innovation.
We're planning to make this year a growth in the area of 3 per cent, perhaps almost more.
It will actually be at least 2%.
On the basis of the recession in a number of countries, it would not be very bad, but it is little for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in many countries, and it must be higher to develop.
Now, it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business, receive the standard of normal price credits, are the first thing they need to do," stressed the Government chapter.

For free medical assistance, roofs and jungles
Dr. George Bvelle provides free medical assistance in the agricultural capacity in Cameroun
Belle and his team are running almost every outcome, taking hundreds of patients
In this Western African country, doctors are not so much -- only one for 5000 people.
Talk here or through your device
Dr. George Bvelle is one of the 10 main CNN held in 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 major heroes to be the Heroe of CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his work.
During the 21th year, George Bvelle saw his father returning to life and again falling into unconsciously with the hospitals that were not fitted properly to help him.
Jamef Bevelle received a trauma in the car disaster in 1981 near the Jawn, Cameroon capital.
He had only a brown hand, but the surrounding infection was spread to the brain and called to the gematic that reminded himself to the end of his life.
“ There were no neurochirurgies in Cameroon, ” George Bwell said.
If we had money, we would have brought him out of Cameroon.
Instead of this, Belle was conducted by his father for years in overflow clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“It's not easy, ” said Belle.
- You can get out of the house at 5th morning, get to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
A lot of patients.
They may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not been very changed from the end of Belle's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor for 5000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the relationship in the United States is one of 413 people.
And even if the camioners could turn to the doctor, many of them would not have been in the carmen.
Two of the five persons in this country will be in the midst of poverty, and almost three quarters of health costs are private.
"Their only problem is poverty," he said.
“And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.”
By seeing the suffering of his father and many of his partners, Belle made a decision to do something with this.
In the past year, Dr. George Bvelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself is a doctor and works as a constitutionist chirurg in the Central Jound hospital.
He also found a non-comercial body of ASCOVIME, which organizes landscapes for free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have granted assistance to approximately 32.000 people.
Almost every fifth, he and even 30 people are buying in the furgone, associating medical access to the boxes, and to visit the needs of the village.
They are not always happy.
Sometimes they had to carry the cars through the river and the river.
But when they come, their meetings are like true heroes: this is a celebration with songs and dances and the best places they can only offer.
Free medical service in these villages is actually a farm for the festival, and Belle with its wide smile and unlimited energy is more than happy to join joy.
Brigade begins to take hundreds of patients on the next morning.
"We take 500 people in each street," he said.
They come with all the surroundings in the radius 60 miles from the village, and they come through.
Each of these clinics on the outcome day provides various medical services.
Many people receive treatment from ma ́a, tuberculosis, lack of food, diabetes, parasites and illnesses.
Others can get coasts or free birth testimony — documents for schools that many poor families simply cannot allow themselves.
Brigade's simple operations under anestenia at night.
Operations are generally conducted in school opinions, municipalities or home; after the procedures, patients arise and go to the post-operation area to free a place for a person.
As a generator for the operational and sanitary equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until the morning.
This is not a temperature, but the integrity of the brigadium is usually helped to support the treasury.
“They strive in the barbans all night, so that we can keep on working,” said Belle.
On Monday, brigade members will be sent back to the city, the strong, but the bitter by their own.
This group, containing camera doctors and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free operations in the past year, and they know that their assistance may have great importance for those who have helped.
One person explained that the free operation for the treatment of the grass would allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical receipts, Bvelle's chirurgic hospital works also nights in private medical clinics around Jaund.
This second work, according to its statement, provides 60 per cent of its non-comercial organization; the rest of the funds are covered by private accounts.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Cathy O'Mellly, a medical student of the second course of the Dressele University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Belle group.
He is always in the hospital or is trying to pay money for the organization so that these campaigns can be continued.
For future doctors and sisters, such as O'Melley, who come from the United States and are to join Belle in carrying out his tasks, it is the opportunity for them to never get home.
"We have received the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped to remove five blood or to hold tools for Dr. Bwell," O'Mellly said.
As a secondary student, you would never have received such opportunities in America.
Voluntary students usually pay their passengers to Cameron, often incoming with medical medicals.
But after they arrived in Yuanda, their food, transport and training paid Belle.
"He's a hero, without doubt," O'Mellly said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Camerun is unfinished.
For Belle, the persistent threat is not a serious challenge.
To help others live happy, to fulfill the promise that his father promises is that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this," said Belle.
- And I think of my dad.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people ridiculous to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can help.

Ambassadors refused to say about health protection
In the midst of the criticism of the President Obama last night, he went to his repeated, unique promise that “if you like your medical insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Since hundreds of thousands of people have been notified about the stop of the service from their passengers, the repayants in recent days have discovered the President that he has introduced the American society in an error.
Obama yesterday has made a few of his final public promises.
"The majority of people who have a medical insurance that works can keep it," he said in his statement in Boston.
As a result of that he called “life in news” as a result of the interruption of services, Obama invited those receiving these notices to seek other options on the market.
Most people will have the opportunity to obtain the best, complex medical insurance plans on the same price or even the advantage of the predict.
He said, "You will receive more good conditions,"
The Administration claimed that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who purchase self-insurance could be required to change the plans because their coverage does not correspond to new standards in accordance with the Medical Assistant Act.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," Sibelius said in a statement before the Energy Committee and the trade of the representatives' palace in Washington.
Sibelius, who curries the Medical Assistant Law, said that the use of the Internet sales and “extremely bad” of October.
“ I'm disappointed and disturbed as all, ” she said.
- I really want to return your confidence."
The healed Sibelius defended this phrase, which was captured by the involved microphone, sitting behind her assistant at the yesterday hearings in the house after heavy debates with a member of the household of Billy Long, the Representative of Missouri, about whether it was committed to enter the Omama Health Programme.
After more than three hours of listening to Long, Sibelius asked again to say why the "Helpler" of the Available Medical Aid Act is not voluntary from the sponsored Government's insurance to receive a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now relates to millions of Americans.
The "Rosbalt" agency abandoned the MMI status for non-estimation weapons
On 31 October, Mosgrordom made a recognition of an inefficiency licence on the registration of the agency Rosbalt, writes "Lenta".
At the holding of the MMI status agencies, the Rock-Narrows for systematic and deep violations of the MME law.
In the course of the process, an inappropriate precedent was established: the Court considered to close the MME, actually refused the issue of the right to move the contracts.
What's Rosbalt?
The Rosbalt Institutional Agency was established in Sankt Peterburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened the second Office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
Agencies also work in representatives in the former SSR countries.
Rosbalt has also developed the function as a Federal Incompetence Analysis Agency since 2001.
In the middle of the 2000s, the Agency included the list of most recognised private SMEs in Russia.
As a result, Rosbalt had always been a sufficient specific knife: the nuclear of the Agency's exhaustive Agencies was set up notes with sources in the right-guarding bodies.
The discussions on the nearby issues to power structures continued throughout the Agency ' s duration.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had a broad source base in various areas, these suggestions were also said that Natalia Chaplin was Victor Churkes' wife in the project chapter.
The role of Chaplina in the Rusbalt's leader to the end is not clear: most often it is called "Ru's owner of the project".
The Director-General of the Agency is Laris Afonina, the main editor of Nikolay Uljanov.
Recently, Rosbalt does not figure in federal MME ratings - not by citizenship, nor by audience.
In October, the Agency took place 25 in the review of the visit of Russian SME sites on LiveInternet version.
LiveInternet said that the average auditor of the Rosbalt.ru site consists of approximately 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand reviews), a month of approximately three million unique visitors.
Including the most popular materials in the past five months, the notes of the insufficiency of Kremla in the events of Ukraine, the death of the solitaire group of the King and Shuth, were buried in Beryl.
The Conflict of Rossbalt with the Rosco Nasour began in July 2013 when the amendment to the IMI law was entrusted with the journalists who were prohibited by non-estimational arms.
The news has found a prohibited lessons in two of the video agencies' website ("Jigith from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot has contaminated oil heights").
The following parties are described differently.
The Rosbalt's supervisory overseer on the finding of video materials has accused the SME law and has been sent to the court with the request to take the licence to the Agency.
The "Rosbalte" stated that the claims of advice were unfair: first, I did not have the textile materials, secondly the mother's words were masked in them, and, for the third, after the warning of the role were removed from the site.
The representatives of the Agency claimed that the Requirement of the Court of Justice in the World Court - and when the request of the Court of Justice was adopted on 22 October 2013, the review of these claims continued.
However, the number of 25 world courts has already decided not to benefit Rosbalt: the principal editor of Nikolay Uliyanov has recognized the guilty of the code on administrative laws and →traff for 20 thousand rubles – 10 thousand for each role.
This, obviously, prevented the outcome of the hearing in Mosgarwood - if you refused to think that the result could be prejudiced before.
On 31 October, the Court decided to recognize an ineffective witness to the registration of Rosbalt, which actually abandoned the MMI status agency.
Without saying, "Rosbalt" remained alone in the past of this opposite.
The Agency supported the deputats of Gosdoma (Agency signed 26 deputates on 10 October by the Chapter of the Rosco-Nassour of Alexander Jarov; the same document was given at the initiative of the KPRF).
The unlawful conclusion of the issue was stated by the Chapter of the Union of the journalists of Russian University Bogdans, the president of the Moscow Union of journalists Paul Gusseb and the Chapter of the President-in-Office of the Human Rights Council of Michael Fedots.
Moreover, Goddan's statement, the leadership of the Rock Nancy even gave him any guarantee that the case would not come before the license revokation.
The Court of Justice showed that there is a great question to be a mass information in Russia today under its jurisdiction.
Syria has an engineering equipment
Syria has recognized all the powers declared for the production of the chemical weapons, recognized the Organization for the prohibition of the weapons.
This first stage of departure of Damask ended the day before the appointed time.
By 1 November, Syria should have made productive and other incompatible objects intended for the preparation of fighting materials to use, transmet B-B-SI.
The destruction of the self-reserves of chemical materials or chemical components should be completed at the middle of 2014.
According to the representative of OZHO, the currently revolving vessels are in printed stocks.
The international insulars were moved to Syria after the 21 August of Damascus in the course of the attack, more than 1400 people were killed by the United States.
The main task of the Indonesians was not to lose time - not to allow Syrian authorities to produce more chemicals - and to enable the infrastructure to meet chemicals and to reduce warfare.
These productive powers will now be carefully observed so that they will not allow their resources.
The next week is the middle of November: To this time, the OZHO and the Syrians have to have a name for the resources of destructive arts.
A lot of questions here.
Where are they going?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be closely checked by west divorce.
They will be prepared to advise the in-workers new objects to check if they would be sure that Damascus has not been opened until the end.
The United States believes that this shot was carried out by the rule of military.
Syria and Russia suggest that this is the case of Syrian rebels.
The world community needed the Syrian leadership, in the meantime of Russian agreement, to make or bring all the powers of the production of sockets, gases and gases, and to comply with these things.
Now, when this stage has passed, it must be a step that has already been in the Syrian Army.
This arsenal is supposed to have more than 1000 tons of nervous-paralytic recycling arts, every natural heat gas and other prohibited chemical materials in several decades of different characters.
It is necessary for the OZHO and the Syrian authorities to begin to take place two weeks.
OZHO Jerry Smith said B-by-si that his in-shore were "personally observed for the equipment".
"They are not now able to carry out further production or mixing of the weapons," he said.
The OZHO states that the in-actors had visited 21 of the 23 objects in Syria and were convinced that the ships for the production of ships and rebounds were distorted or brought into disappointment.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out the inspection, stated in the document, but the equipment was transferred from there and checked by OZHO specialists.
According to Smith, the infrastructure process for the production of hydrocarbons was " annually inappropriate" because it had been to work in the context of the continuing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OZHO received the Nobel World Premium, but, according to Smith, it was time to release it to the Insufficients until it was found, they were too busy.
John Carry says in his unprecedented recognition that the American spion was "income unlikely far"
John Kerry's demonstrator of taktic protection of the United States follow-up programmes, making an unprecedented acknowledgement that in some cases the United States spying has “increasingly far”.
The Secretary also recognized that Barack Obama was guilty of the “autopilot” when Edward Snowden was involving the NB’s spiral activity.
The United States Government put this information out to the center of the diplomatic scandal with their associates.
By speaking on videos at the open Governing Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "No doubt that the President and I and other members of the Government have actually accepted some of the things that occur on the carrier, since this was already possible, and during the Second World War, and in very difficult years of cold war, and, of course, on 11 September."
Then he was the first member of the United States Government who admitted that the United States spion was too far, but stressed that no rights were imposed.
He said, "In some cases, this has been unlikely far away.
The chairman also decided to broke the light on this question and explain to people, and now it has a strong analysis to make no one feels of misuse.
I assure you that there is no misuse in this process against innocent people."
Mr. Carry insisted, however, that the UNB had been from good incentives and that its follow-up operations had rescued many lives.
He added: “We work in a new world where people are ready to explode.
There is a radical extremism in the world, an unwise and full decision to kill people, to explore people and to attack governments.
And if you were able to catch it, staying it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircrafts, explosions and murder, because we have learned about these plans earlier.
Among the American legislators, however, will be made in order to help resolve the issues of the United States proposed spioners and to convince the need to continue anti-Terrorist activities with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Peace Affairs on Thursday.
The Senator of the State of Connea Merphy said that he negotiated members of the Parliament and other members of this week and threatened them to stop participating in anti-terrorists because of disappointment in relation to the lack of the National Security Agency.
"For the interests of the United States national security, it is really important that our parties remain in respect of our common anti-terrorist efforts," said the Democrate Merphy, who works at the first time, and I am the Chairman of the Subcommittee of the Senate on Peace Affairs, interview from Washington.
— And I am going to be able to make them understand that we should continue to cooperate in combating terrorism, despite their anger on the conduct of these NB programmes."
The news that the NB has collected millions of phone records in the United States, has been deteriorated by some of the United States Unions, although the head of the Agency stated that they were irrelevant and reflected the disapproval of the metadata collected by NATO and which they shared with the United States.
In other areas, the Snowden's documents were reported that the NGO was monitoring the phone of the German Officer of the Angels Merckel, as well as the phones about 34 other world leaders.
The Director of the National Discrimination of James Clapper protected the Spanish activity against the Union and said that it was a common case from both sides.
On the background of this brush, Merphy said that his office was organizing an emergency of members of the Congress, which, as expected, remains in this year, and that he hoped that members of both parties and the two palats would enter into the delegation.

The new composition of public supervisory committees increases the impact of the employees
Today, the Council of the Community Palace (OP) can approve new sums of public supervisory Commissions (ONC) in 43 Russian regions.
If the vote is adopted, the lobbys will increase their impact.
ONC is public structures controlling the conditions of the contents of freedom.
The cases of Sergei Magnitski and Leonida Disoverova, the concerns of the Spanish - just through the UNC are reported to the majority of the resolutional events.
For the control of UNC and the fight between the rightsguardians and the lobbysts.
At the meeting of the OOP group's slaves, I have made a criteria for the selection of legal activities.
"It wasn't accepted, and the forms of a swimming, and you did not have the criteria," says Valeri Borschov.
The current president of the Moscow Supervisory Commission and the Association of independent observers, the universal structure of legal defence, is undertaken by the issues of the issues.
As the Deputy of the Gosmond from the Jablock, he had the Law that regulates the UNHCR activity.
The OP Council should vote for the UNHCR sums in 43 countries.
On 1800 vacuums, less than thousands of volunteers are claimed, and in Injushazia and Cabardino-Balcaria competitions have not been able to organize because of the absence of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a donation on vacant places.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few competitive committees, despite the renew of 20 will be 40 participants.
According to Burschov, the current committee of 11 rights-guardians and 9 forces, and in the vote in the OP, the proportion is changed to 17 to 23.
Moreover, 30 rightsguardians wanted to fall into the staff committee.
Therefore, the Representative of the Brothership of God may again enter into a new set.
He was a member of the UNHCR three years, but he never visited the prisoners anyway.
The fighter believes that the forces, by nameing their President of the UNC, are able to make legal protectors unnecessary, therefore the rights-guardians do not exclude collective outcome from the Commission.
They believe that the movement of forces coordinates an Anton Bloodkov member of the UNFC, the name of the "Russian Officers" - an organ which is aware of the interests of the forces.
"I don't eat a kid on the bar," said the BCK daily Anton Bluekov.
He refuses to lobby the movement of any lists and says it is not going to prevent the right-guardians to visit arrested opponents.
According to Colorkov, he was not even interested in what list they are voting in the OP.
It considers the form of pressure.
The potential success of the right-guardians is planning to change the leading of the OECD.
It would have been able to remove it because of the last year's copies.
The Common Room concluded that the leadership of the Ignor Commission was the problem of the prisoners.
And here's the ONC Rost-on-Done can go from the right-guardians to the wallets.
From the new lists of the "proliferated" rights-president of the Commission, one of its representatives, despite that in May 2013 the Federal Court excluded it for non-ethical behavior.
The lists of the Moscow and Hazard Commissions of Borsthev are "copeysk".
Toloconic hopes have not affected the ONC of Mordway, which is "force"; it is a new amount that only one rightsguardian wanted to fall, and it has not even accepted documents for competition.
The member of the OP Nicolai Swanides reported the RCB daily that he voted against the proposed box, since he was involving the situation in Moscow and Rostove-na-Dona.
He sent his position to other members of the Council.
His colleague on OOP Paul Gusseb says he voted for, since he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The coordination of the establishment of the CNS lists by the Secretary-General of OP Vladislav Gryb, which is also the Scientific Research Institute of the FSIN.
The Gryb reported daily that it does not consider the right to share the candidates in the rights of the rights of defenders and the forces and that the Commission presidents have sufficient powers to prevent its members.
The Greb is not to predict the results of the vote of the OOP Council.
If the proposed list will be opened today, the amendment will be issued in the next days of vote.
The Australian woman is apologizing against a period of time in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sidney, who was sentenced to 15 persons on the Phuket Island for the false fact that she had been attacked by the taxist, gave an appointment to the court and was released under charge.
Steve Roshel B'Ford was initially recognised by the Phoecat Province Court of 15 June in the case of a false request after the Tayland police report that the taxist on the night attacked on Sunday 10 June, while two other men held it.
However, the video camera records later found that she was welcomely returned to her hotel after the breaking with her Australian battlefriend.
The Phoebe police asked B'Ford for two days before she recognized that she had made this story.
Before the court, it was contained in police cameras.
The Ford was sentenced to a 15-year-old period in the Phucket general regime in the area, not in the female for adults.
She is the daughter of the former player of the Australian League Peter Tanks, who returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberre for aid for her daughter.
Tanx said the Sunday Telegraph of Sydney that the whole family was "finely disappointed" for her daughter's welfare and waited for her return to Australia.
"Obviously it was a worrying time, but we hope that she will be home as well as possible," Tanx said.
The B'Ford was charged with an appointment to his sentence and was released in 50,000 baths.
According to the reports in Australia, it is at the same time to carry out its release in the Crabbi's curriculum in South Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that B'Ford presently represents Phuquet's representation, but warned that the apology could lead to the increasing court's sentence for a period of two years and allows it to take a period of time for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian tourist Michel Smith in Phukete Thailand, he may also strive to restore his tourist, which will lead to the execution of a justifiable court.
