Woman announced her job to search for 57 days after her missing honey
Two months a woman from Washington looked for her missing dog - and announced that she had an additional job. The seven-year-old border Collie was left from the hotel room during a short license in Montana. 57 days was missing every track - but Carole King did not.
"I was scared. I became bad," Carole King said to the "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband left Hundin Katie in the hotel room while they went to the evening. When they then returned to the hotel, Katie was disappeared. They looked for the animal, but without success.
Donner had placed a dog in a panic

The people stopped in their vehicles, went out and worried us. I think the whole neighbor knew we had found them."

Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machines of the type MG3 are lost as before.
In the past years, the Federal War has lost many weapons and → thousands of shits Munition, and there are also three machine weights. The rest is in most cases unexpected. The opposition refers to a "fresh" measure.

Oiltanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian town
More than two months after his establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oiltanker "Stena Impero" left the town of Bandar Abbas today on Friday. As the ship observation data showed refinitive, the tanker was moved and left the Iranian town. As a target gate, Port Rashid was given in the United Arab Emirates.
The Tanker was released from the Iranian Government on Monday, but he remained in Iranian warriors.
The "Stena Impero" was established on 19 July by the Iranian Revolution Garden in the seastraße of Hormuz under the prejudice to have violated security votes. However, it was believed that the Iran reacted to the constraint, temporary fixation of a Iranian oiltanker before the Gibraltar belonging to the United Kingdom.

The officer reported, among other things, the condition of the Stasi Central. "The security was taken from the terror," she said.
Musk streë’s delivery record
Teslas Quartal may hold a record. Despite the delivery tree, there was recent loss in the electrical conserve.
New York.Tesla-Cheef Elon Musk has > Electrocars with the view of new record numbers strongly uploaded on the bars. "We have the chance to get our first quarter with 100,000 supplies," wrote Musk in one of the broadcast "Electre" e-mails published in the Tesla mediators.
The request is strong so that Tesla could buy 110000 orders, it continued in music writes. The challenge is to bring the cars quite to the knowledge. This means that Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors this: Teslas shares went with a plus of more than six pro ́ of the trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk brought records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver 360000 to 400000 cars. This is why there must be six numbers in the running and coming fourth year. In particular, the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here the winning costs are less. Despite the boom was lost.
Rate solved: That's why we can't kitch ourselves
One kind of bremse in the Grand Sherry prevents people to kitchen themselves. These found actors of the University of Humboldt in Berlin with the help of experiments to rats, as they reported at the morning. It also has been achieved in the question why children are so quickly against the kitzels only to ask more.
S Sie also showed why only the neighborhood of a kitzling hand was already in front of the laughing. This is a deep-leaving shit in the grandhood, which already exposes the laugh at the waiting of the kitzel.
According to the information, previous research showed that rats with "laughter" reacted in the Ultrashall area when they were cut off by people. This "laugh" will be provided by the part of the large heat inside, which serves of the central processing of the haptic receipt.
Laughing will be understood during self-treatment
Even so, the Berlin researchers found out that the brain between self - and touch can be distinguished by others - so that people can't kitch themselves. But now, in the experiments of the rats, the laughs found that the A's area of the Great Thursday will be understood during a self-trace. This is also the way when lives are put on their own. Currently, the strangers and the kitzels are the A's in the brain and the impuls are strengthened.
But pass the self-treatment and interview by others at the same time, the laugh is also subject to. This indicates that the brain of the race can not even distinguish between the self-train and the touch by others. The new knowledge closed that people couldn't be able to throw themselves, because the self-train actives a breaming in the large coast.
The rats were also trained to kitsel themselves, so sometimes they declined this initiation in the experiment sometimes before, showing flight behavior or terror. This ambivalence is equal to the behavior of the children. The ambition of the kitzels is a behavior that is equal to rats and people.
Dismissed catastrophes: Great fuel in French chemical work erased
The great fire was deleted in a specially relevant chemical work in the North French city Rouen, which shared the prefecture of the Normandy of the AFP News Agency on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night.

Iran gives British tankers free
The UN's general debate did not solve the conflict of Iran, but there is now a less problem. The British oiltanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could replace the sea. It could be a puzzle in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oiltanker "Stena Impero" from middle July on the street of Hormus in Iran has returned to international wagers. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Reedier Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" left the hall of Bandar Abbas and the crew now takes for medical studies to Dubai, explained Reederickef Erik Hå. On midday, the ship left the Iranian warriors. "Shaw that it's over," he said to the Swedish televisor SVT.
The External Ministry of Londres was the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of trials to affect the freedom of the sea, and we work with our international partners to maintain the shipship and maintain the international law," it stated in a Friday communication.
The Iranian Revolution Gardens had established the Tanker on 19 July under the prejudice to have missed the rules of sea law in the Persian Golf. Seven of the 23 Employment members have already been released on the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members have made the circumstances good, said Haha. They would have behaved professionally in view of the weak and exhausting situation in the last weeks. The Reedier now works for them to get back with their families as soon as possible.
The British Government, behind the establishment of the "Stena Impero", assumed a reaction to a similar event in the British Gibraltar: the beginning of July was a supertanker with oil from the Iran, which would have been determined to be put to the cat. The delivery suggested to the authorities against EU sanctions against the war country. The reference to the ship was received by the United States.
The Iran spoke of "piratery" and dropped with consequences. In August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was released in the midst of August. Mut measurements, it has been handled for a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero", as London was deeply returned.
The Road of Hormus is one of the most important seaways of the world. It connects the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A majority of the world's oil exports are moved through the sea. The spendings in the region have grown in the past months. The trade driving was in conflict between the United States and the Iran.
After the spendings between Teheran and Washington, the atmosphere of both countries stands. The Americans threw the Iranian leadership to build atomic weapons. The Iran reveals it. The United States were solely extracted from the international atom agreement that prevents Iran from building an atom bomb and should end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government sets the lead in Teheran with massive economic action against the country to strengthen a stronger and in other areas. The Iran is opposed to the pressure.
Because of the fight against the "Stena Impero" and other events with tankers in Persian Golf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States work at a coalition for a military protection of the trade chiefs in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace at the street of Hormus at the United Nations Voll Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of hope" for the Persian Golf, Iran would like to ensure the security of the ship in the Persian Golf.
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In the case of the penalty of the American President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign products were forced to be distributed in the People's Republic. Financial chiefs of Asian businesses, which make their production from China to another country, called India in an investigation of UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This is freely not only to play with the inconsistencies of the Chinese-American trade wars. With a rich pool of young workforces and a majority of 1,3 billion consumers seemed to create India as so, in the worldwide production check.
However, now India has been conducted in Trumps Focus. From Haudegen in the Weazen House devaluing as the "King of Zisce", the United States first June has made the trade benefits for 2000 products. The United States relate to the high-Zive India and requires a better market access to farmers, mobile phones, spirits, motors and other things.
On the World War Wars, the Rivers with India are freely a near-show place. Moreover, America considers the world's biggest democracy by the security brilliant. Delhi and Washington connects the concern of China's Machtan Spruch in South India. In this context, a salve-ananish penalty against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has even arrived in a second five-year official period, should be safe.
The problem is in the other place: the empiry strengthened Thes that open markets clear the economic development, has a difficult position in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. His reformer is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic irritation, which has developed too long in the country of the population. Companys now receive quicker building authorisations for building. They benefit from a better energy and power infrastructure, and a closer incursion and concurrence law makes conditions to liquidate firms with high debt.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic optics, in India, in the first five months, many things have been better, but in the trade policy it does not apply.
In Western, the Modi of the Nimbus energy reformer, which renews its country economically radically. This impression is not late to the condition that the charismatic Prime Minister only knows what Vocabular likes western managers. In the kernel, the "India First" advokat has never declined from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies to be forced to deduce anachronistic affairs and so to be made for the global competition.
Contribution by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris

The competitor in the goal: Dabo is the first secret herd of the light atletic WM
The world shot was already long in the goal when Khalifa International Stadion was playing a warming scene. In the first past of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to hunt annually. He was able to hold up 300 meters before the goal, walked in unrighteous standing, as Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly understood him and embraced him the last half stadion round in the goal. The powers were at the two, but still to stop the target of the coming armband hall. As if the scenes were not enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after running in Mixed Zone, when he was perfectly unexpected that the attention of the collected journalists went on himself. Shooters first he would not talk about his herdship. Sâb wanted to set up his personal best time and when he saw that this would be difficult, he wanted only to help a patient. And unless he would be surprised to represent his country, which was invited to the WM. In normal circumstances he would not be able to start. "I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
This he did at the evening with pressure - and much more intense than he had thought about it. For this held will remain in memory. At the same time Dabo left his competitive Busby even in the goal and volunteerly took the last place - but well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who wined this past. That was enough to have nothing in the end of all, because the busby was only with much help in the goal was just due to the end of the world light athletic band disquali.
It was Dabo, who lived in Portugal and studied in Lisbon, to build a personal time at the WM in Doha. It sounds of rational data with 18:10,87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already." However, only in training, there are no best time.
Million mask: Egyptians strive for a wild protest day

In the past days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and the phones of footpassers were partly searching for news and photos related to the protests.
Enemies of Al-Sisi
Last week, it came to Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They addressed the Government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critical corruption and misleading. A so open protest against the political leader had not been given in Egypt for years. The Spanish exil lived Egyptian builder and shau player Mohammed Ali, who demonstrated with video boots on Facebook in his role, has for today's Friday to a "million Mars" on central places in the country. Ali requires a "volution" in Spanish Exil.
The number of arrests related to Protests continued to increase. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) numbered more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization of Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests.
Welcome adoptions
People were "will be arrested" "only because they were "for wrong time at the wrong place", HRW shared in the vocation of legal advocates. The prejudices against the arrested were rich in accordance with their advocates from "expansion of false information" to membership in a "Terrorist union". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities were asked and searched for security forces in Uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW information, also voluntary passengers.
HRW also criticized the Zensur in the North African country, and then the Government blocks on Kairo Websites and Online Services to connect other protests against Sisi.
Online handlers: Separators need to easier returns
For online handlers, many back-sized packages have lost goods.
The Financial Ministry has shown online negotiators such as Amazon and Zalando a way how they can be able to destroy back-sized products.
Although the company is not able to be released from the tax on Sachs, the Minister explained a question of the Green-Bundtage Group on which the newspapers of the radio media group reported on Friday, but the salariers could put the market value of the unfair returns so low that they should not be sold or just a small volume.
Agencies of the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens would return to each sixth package on the Internet.
The Green Group Chairman Katrin Göring-Eckardt requested the Minister for Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies can evaluate non-productional products respectively and freely for useful organizations. The companies should not be punished for S.
Banksy Cost for Auktion: There was never a better time to overcome this bathroom
The work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "The Parliament", will be increased.
For Brančik, the Banksys work underlines the "the restructuring of the oldest parliamentary democracy of the world in the foundation of animals and tribes". Since Saturday, the report will be issued at Sotheby's main city until it is to be increased on 3 October. It will be estimated to 1,5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first issued in the British Museum of Bristol in the Southwest British Museum in 2009, where Banksy le. In this year, the artist had repeated the report - as well as the original Brexit date on 29 March. In this occasion, the work that was called the previous "A question time" was called "The Delegated Parliament".
The image could change the owner for a million.
The Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the middleweek at the first meeting of the sub-huses after a derogation of an interruption by the Master Court of Justice had made a hard exchange with the opposition. Johnson wanted to carry out the brexit already moved on 31 October, even without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that the Banksy, whose integrity is still not known, is mixed into the Brexit discussion. In Dover in South East England, he screwed a picture that represents a man who draws a star of the flag with a meat. The work sees thousands of Lkw-fahrers and others at the arrival to the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit-debat is like a "Passage in Park"
The appeal of the British Premier Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-Gár in Parliament, according to his adviser, does not contribute to a climate of hate. In comparison to the election fight before the Brexit Referencendum 2016, the current conflicter is a "spacing in the park", Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book view. "We'll enjoy it. We'll go out (from the EU) and we'll win."
Johnson had taken a serious attack in the Parliament in the past days, including the "contract" to the people, and accusations that he could bring the ladies to this way because they could become a target of murdering, he dealt with as "Humbug".
Commings said that the only way to restore peace is that the Members would finally respect the decision of the British deputy for an exhibition from the EU. It is not surprising that the people are not surprised that the United Kingdom has not yet been out of the EU three years after the referendum.
On Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church were called to keep. "We should speak with respect together," he said in a clothing. "And we should also listen."
President of Pakistan Khan requests an uno-Income in Kasch
With a emotional call, the President of Pakistan Imran Khan invited the United States to take an intervention in the conflict of Kash at the first meeting before the Uno Voll assembly.
Otherwise, there is a new war between the atmosphere of Pakistan and India likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If it is bad, you hope for the best, but you are prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kasch. "You had to prevent it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from the British Colonial Government in 1947, two of them to the shared region Kasch. Both atmosphere rule each part of Kash, another part of China. In August, India had taken the autonomy status of the Indian Cash region and thus increased the spending in the context of Pakistan.
Don't even a flash of water
The demonstrators in Kairo request the street of the Egyptian President Al-Sisi.
On the current protests in Egypt, the Government reacts with hard hand. He allows the people to shoot a scarce munition over 2000 prisoners to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in there. Protest was never unfair in Egypt. However, since the overcome of the power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the State apparatus makes everything to avoid a scenario like in the days of the Arabs.
However, one of the soldiers for the protests 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, inspeativeness and the feeling that the Government has caused millions to go on the street. And this is a problem that the trumpet of el-Sisi doesn't get into the grip, whether it happens hard against the opposers. The situation has even hurt.
Today, every third in Egypt under the poverty limit. Since 2016, the whale has lost more than the half of its value, the inflation rate is at 日 Pro. Whoever wants to buy a flash of water must decide who financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The last one is not only responsible for the stress but also for the greatest economic actor. The military builds roads, homes, football stations, produces food and many more. This was already before el-Sisi. With authorized regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the super. It will always be critical if large parts of the population have difficulties to lead to a flash water.
Thuv tests in the terminal: BER-Cheef: No "showstopper" anymore for main city airports
Two months have been checked whether the complicated BER burning mixture works together. The operators are satisfied with the history, but the BER has not yet been completed.
Following major Tüv tests in the terminal of the future major city airport, the operators have made the planned performance in October next year. This is safe, the Supervisory Boss Ra日 Bretschneider said after a meeting of the control framework.
Airport leader Angelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a complete test, but he also said that it was still a manage to work in the terminal. "We have many details, but we have no real showstopper." He assured that the time schedule contains even buffer.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reservation should not be too large, and the construction indicator is now to be provided for in the first quarter of 2020, which was for the first year to begin with this heritage.
Hundreds of deficiencies of electricity cabines are still to be highlighted; the Tüv wants to check them up until February. "To create the conditions for the entry into the flight, it must continue to be intensively in the processing of the deficiencies," it said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about failing evidence, less about a new cab. There is no release for all depths in which the cabs depend on. The aircraft head expects that these will be before the end of the year.
The burning protection works on the transition to the bathroom under the terminal yet not satisfied. The problems have led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it's about smoking shorts that come down at a burning like a lingery, so that the smoke doesn't spread. They run too far. 36 engines have to be exchanged, and then the beginning of the year will be made new trials with hazardous smoking.
Problems with fire protection and other tree angels and planning errors have lost the planning of the aircraft since years. It should therefore enter into operation in 2011. The costs have increased from two billion billion euros to probably approximately 6,5 billion euros in the next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have been clearly identified, the responsibility plans the development of the aircraft, therefore it should be held in a special meeting of the Supervisory Council on 18 October, as the President of Bretschneider announced.
The Airport Society now looks for two new business leaders. Financial Chef Heike Fölster changes the end of the year to the German Bahn, Manfred Bobke from Camen goes next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster.

Rain, overweight, healthy nutrition - there are risk factors for heart-crossing diseases. But what is a heart weight or an infarct really out? Hamburger researchers want to see the inheritance of 9000 healthy and sick people right now.
About the analysis of the inheritance of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss composers want to get the causes of heart-cycle diseases more detailed to track.
The research project is the largest of this type in Germany, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) shared on Friday. The Küne Station promotes the preservation of 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high-birg clinic Davos belongs to the establishment and the University Citizen Zürich.
Overweight, smoke and unhealthy nutrition are the essential risk factors for heart cross-cycle diseases. Genetic agens determine the risk. The combination between genes and external influences is only insufficient, he said. Now the responsibility of the full inheritance of 8000 healthy people will be compared to the previous 1,000 patients of the University of Heart and Feeds at UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the 200,000 relevant human genes, the possibility of illness caused by DNA, such as Mut日, was called Clinic.
The objective of the five-year project is to develop new options, such as pre-sorption, recognition and treatment of heartrhythmuses, heart heat and heart infarcts. The data may also benefit from researching other people’s diseases, so Stefan Blakenberg, leader of the University of Heart and Features. New recognition of the association between heart and brain, heart and renal and cancer diseases.
The president of the Küne Station, Klaus-Michael Küne (82), also stressed that it was the strong will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Clinic of the Station in Davos is treated up to all the time. Now it is to be found in the nearby medical campus for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and is created a professional for bioinformation. In the reason of his commitment, the living logistic undertaking said that he was opered three years ago in Hamburg in the open heart and very thankful.
The biological tests of the healthy participants are of Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45.000 probands, it is the most local health study of the world, according to the information of the clinic. In the inheritance encryption, they are severely respected for the protection of the anonymized data. It is about a petabyte (1.000 terabytes) on data, Holger Moch said from the University capital Zürich.
The inheritance of a person today can be decrypted by UKE within 24 hours. The pure cases are for 1300 euros. The first genetic sequence of the world, which has been published in 2001, has been published for several hundreds of millions of euros. This will begin on October 1, 2020, all 9000 tests will be analysed, and the first results will be expected in the year.
Nigerian police delivers hundreds of mishandeled boys
In Nigeria, the police has released more than 300 people who were followed and misused from a Coran School. According to the indication of the inhabitants, the security forces in the northern Kaduna city and discovered the victims of minor years, as the police speakers of Yakubu Sabo noticed. "The victims were mishandeled, some of them told to be managed by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the prevention to be trained in the Coran and "build". In fact, their teachers were held under "the most valuable and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. About hundred students, including children in nine years of age, were attached to a small room.
The Coran School was aware of the information since about EEC years. Inhabitants would have noticed the authorities on repetitive irregularities in the establishment. The parents would have shown themselves shocked when they were informed about the situations in the Coran School, Sabo said. They would have not recognised the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested by the police.
In the major muslims north of Nigeria, there are many private corancules, which are often replaced by the deficiencies of State institutions. The people in the region suffer under frequent attacks of armed bands. According to UN refugee shift work, they fled in the past months over the border of the Neighbourhood Niger.
Ecuated and followed: Nigeria police delivers 400 children from school
Policies in a school in North Nigeria delivered almost 400 students from disappointment. "Most of them were attacked and some of them had visible damages that were insighted on folters," police speakers Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after a statement in a islamic school, where the states were "humany" and the officers took the school leader and six teachers after the release action.
The children, all the boys, were held in their school as slaves and were placed on chairs. Some have been sexually misuse. Television images showed dismayed and harmful students in a recognizable bad health condition.
World Football Selection: More predecessors after Mexis and Clouds
Football "Invalid signature"
Jürgen cloud, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe out
With a gala in Mayland, the world football band Fifa is the best player, the best player, and the best tragedy of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and so record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he had never voted at the World Football election, other countries came from the Fifa prejudice. Egypt was not evaluated with a reasonable basis.
In the past years, the WM, dubiose plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupted functionaries. The Fifa-Welt-football election has not yet been in the decree to run uncleanly - if you do not see that the voted national tra and national communities of the members are often voting for the Sympathia.
However, after the Captain of Nicaragua had already complained that he did not vote, there are no more injustices: Egypt lamentates that the votes of Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account.
The Fifa is apologizing that "the signatures on the election forms in major letters were not valid, so it was not valid." You have contacted the Egyptian connection many times to clothe the situation - without answer.
Sudan Tra ́ also amazed
In addition from Sudan, there is a claim about the choice. Although the shopping in the case of Egypt is suitable, the Sudanese association states that Traë Holdko Lugarisic has not agreed as it was evaluated: with Lionel Messi on the place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote is so, with signatures and official stempel of the Sudanese band.
In the case of the Nicaragua Captain Juan Barrera, the proposals had also stated: "Have not agreed for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information on my voice are wrong, thanks," he wrote. In the case, it was considered that the Nicaragua football band simply was voted in ­ name.
From the band came on Friday the report: True, but of course it was no intention. The election records were "irreformly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the Captain of Nicaragua's election, called it in a communication of the band. But I chose the second Captain Manuel Rosas. "We take the responsibility for the administrative error," it was said in the communication. Sowohl Rosas and the communitystra, Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, "as it is in the official list of the FIFA".
The other cases allow the Fifa to check in an investigation now, but it suggests that the election process has been observed from the PriceWaterhouseCoopers advisory. As long as Lionel Messi remains inconsistent winners of the world football election - and Jürgen Kloppa Worldtra’s year.
Ukraine Affairs: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
"I think that the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the United States Bundesstat Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where it comes from here, it will be determined by the figures that are found." He wants to know more about the whistleblower business before taking measures. A procedure of impeachment can lead to the end of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the enthries. These had shown that Trump had called the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj again on a phone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic President and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott followed the Trump Biden "severe years".
The Republicans have noticed the criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower business, but only a few have discovered disapprovals. Scott's comments are now the first sign of it in Trumps Party, which has already been associated with the moderate Governor of Virginia against Trumps, including the lockering of environmental protection rules and the destruction of immigration rules.
As other rational republicans, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also said to the investigation. "It is a deeply distorting situation," Baker said. "The right procedure and the responsibility for the Congress is now to examine the matter and to go for the reason."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of the United States, have not been formally associated with the procedure against Trump, which is decided in the Congress, thus their expressions are symbolically important. However, the first Senators of the Republican also have critically expressed the situation.
The business could be considered in the introduction of an official procedure against Trump which the democrats in the representative house have announced an investigation, and they reject the use of power misuse for the purpose of a foreign influence for their own political benefits.
There is no precise time schedule for the dealing procedure, but most of them in the representative house could strive to the democracy a so-called impeachment, but the decision on a real officiality fell in the senate where the Trumps Republicans have the majority. The views on the success of such a procedure are less.
Was Folterer on Board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicilia, they have been managed and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
Dutch Captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had not allowed the Lampedusa town to be able to be able to acquire the ship with the "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international critics - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her home arrest was re-leased after a few days by a Italian judge.
Now the new severe prejudices against rackets will be sounded. Three men who have been able to make folters in Libyan refugee camps, with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The convictors have become in a recording camp in Messina (Sicilia) after the migrants have recognized their peiners in Italy. "We can not exclude it, but have no safe information on it," said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben new builders of the German Presse Agency.
The police called the middle September that the contemporary in the northern African country managed, calmed and even killed. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptian Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematicly schicanized and excluded grapes - by repeated and continuous corporate violence," it said in the communication.
NGOs and help organisations now show that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We can't scan who people are. They come without pass," said the new builder. Folter is one of the main reasons why people fly from Libya. It is therefore likely that the ships are also able to be able to be on the ships. "It is therefore very important to follow."
The Italian Ex-Inner Minister Matteo Salvini requested immediate excuses against which it was still granted in Italy for aid for illegal immigration.
Musk streë’s delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given a powerful explosion of electric car concerns with the view of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to get our first quarter with 100,000 supplies," wrote Musk in one of the Branchen blog "Electre" e-mails to Tesla employers.
The request is strong so that Tesla could buy 10,000 orders, it continued in music writes. The challenge is to bring the cars quite to the knowledge. To this end, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible.
Investors this: Teslas shares went with a plus of more than six pro ́ of the trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95,000 cars and so that it had reached its valuation.
Musk brought records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Thus, in the running and coming fourth year, six numbers have to be given. In particular, the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here the winnings are less. Despite the boom was lost.
US Budget Conflict: Renew only a bridge financing
The new budget year will be started in the United States on 1 October without a regular budget. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and finished a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the Congress and President Donald Trump have agreed in August to increase the budgetary limits for the year 2020 and 2021, the United States stand before the new year starting on 1 October. The Senate followed the Representative House on Thursday and has made a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without a decision on the middle of 1 October, it would have come to a Shutdown, a part-limit of the Federal Administration. The President Trump must still take into force the decision.
Shutdown disabled
The Federal Administration is currently financed at the level and the priorities of the budget plans for the end of Monday 2019. This is because the Congress does not have timely on the 12 departments, which allow the various departments and authorities to provide funds. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the new budget year of 1,3 Bio. to 1,4 Bio.
The democrats have fulfilled the most of the twelve laws in the representative house, but they reflect the priorities of the democratics dominated by the Republicans.
The spirits are especially separated from the Award of Ressources for the Internal Security and Limit Safety. In the senate, the Republicans are trying to force 12 billion dollars for the building of the wall, one of the big priorities of President Trump. The democrats swing themselves to the wall buildings and their financing, which is intended for other military buildings and projects. The fight against the wall building was already scaled in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shiutdown.
In the wall building the spirits separate themselves
It is now unexpected how the parties want to approach this question. More likely than an agreement on all 12 hours in the coming seven weeks is an extension of the transition financing on 21 November. A Shutdown is then not excluded.
In the light of the persistent incapacity of the congress, the financing of the Federal Administration would continue automatically at the previous year, underline the travel activity of the Parliament and keep their sales until the new annual issue plans.
France allows artistic inflation for lesbens and Singles
In France, the artificial inquiry will also be opened by single women and lesbs: the Pariser National Assembly agreed with a large majority of the Government's legislative proposal for all women to take advantage of in-vitro inflammation, so that the request for anonymous Samen should be clear.
In the three-day emotional debates, critics in the right store had warned that many "kinds without father" could grow in the future. The French Bischof Conference is also against the renewment.
The re-regulation is the nuclear component of a bio-electrical process, which protected the health minister Agnès Buzyn as "chance" for the society. It represents the modern family in which children are given with only a parent or homosexual parents.
Prohibition with a sperm of dead husband continued
The national assembly, however, returned a amendment that the widows should give access to the sperm of their dead man. In Czechland, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artistic inquiry "post-morth" is allowed. In Germany, in the past cases in which women accused the exhibition of the sperm of a dead man. The enemies of the prejudice in Paris argued that a child is so born, then, "in the last cases, in the past, in the cases where women have been accused of the exhibition of a slaughter.
However, many deputy of the Governing Party La Republic en Marche (The Republic in Moviment, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition were expressed for the artificial inquiry with the sperm of the dead partner.
The initiatives of the currently malformed amendment believe that a widow may be able to benefit from the sperm of an unknown but not with its own partner.
To this end, the artificial injury in France is allowed only thermosexual couples that cannot be witnessed to children. You must be married or at least two years together. Buzyn had already announced that the leathership remains prohibited.
In Germany theoretically, the art inquiry is open to all women - for single or lesbian couples it is often difficult.
Payment for climate: Call after flight payment for Unis become la
In the high schools, the country would like to make a climate tax, and the directors said that they had no money for it, but now they were also under pressure.

The debate on a climate transfer on flights of universities and high schools is renewed before the summer pause. After the country sector conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding progress from the green and black coalition, the plan now receives support from the high schools. In a common department, the doctors of six bath-hour-temporary universities and a phedagogic high school for a compensation of service flights. This is the first step "driving need", at the same time needs to provide a wide debate on the avoidability of flights, it is said in their opinion. The initially planned cabinet decision is still on the ice because the CDU has not yet been stumbled by the model.
Russia reaffirms Northern Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the arrested in Russian armies would have been illegal. Ten days before, 161 fishers from North Korea were already found, and there was a change between the borders and the shipbuilding. Three Russian and a northern Korean were destroyed, and the fisherman later made his serious damage. But this time there was no loss, he said.
The Communist North Korea suffers of chronic na ́s absence. The Northern Korean fishermen were then in Russia's headquarters, where the Coast Watching of Russia is given its own information to protect their multi-biological resources Patro'n.
30,000 Tinth Fisheries
In the renewed controls, 30,000 tissues were discovered and arrested on the ships. The information was taken after three fisheries and two motor ships and brought to Nachodka and postjet to Vladivostok.
Russian fisheries auditors also have not been issued to the North Korean fisheries in this year, according to the statements of domestic undertaking. Thousands of Northern Korean fishers have already been identified in this year.
The leader of the Russian Fishing Company in the remote region Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently complained high environmental damage by the Northern Korean fishers. They fished with anxious synthetic networks in Russia, which would also take small lives out of the sea. In addition, the networks would simply be exhausted in the sea where they had 200 years to be destroyed.
Only 18,000: US reduction asylum overlides
The "greatest nation in history" is Donald Trump, here at a meeting with selected police officers in the White House.
The richest country of the Earth looks for protection seekers: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington, the above limits for the legal movement of refugees will be continued. Artists will receive threatened believers and Iraqian asylum, especially.
The US Government wants to reduce the low limits of the introduction of new refugees. In the economic year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at least 18,000 people should be left in the country, as the US foreign minister explained. In the nearly past economic year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
The Government of President Donald Trump has drasticly granted the adoption of protectors from all the world in the past years. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, they have acquired valuable recording limits.
The upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the United States refugee programme in 1980. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeated the United States as "the most miserable and greatest nation in the history", a formulation that is highly reported to the use of the US official President's language.
A "responsibility-conscient commitment" with refugees is aware that refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuilding it, the Trump explained that for his hard course in migration policy, he has a lot of advantages, but there is also a massive criticism.
A large fighting point is the border of Mexico, which wants to break the Trump. To financ the building of a border wall, Trump had declined the national need. Whether there is a temporary connection between the current measure and the current internal developments in the US capital, it is unexpected. Trump is currently under pressure because of Selensky's business and a sustainable pressure procedure.
The US Government will, after presentation from the Foreign Affairs, make it possible to take into account two refugees groups: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Irakers who have helped the US Military in the country and have been made in it, as shown by the External Ministry. From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, they must be recorded at least 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to find that people from this "Northern Triangle" Mediterranean in other countries are asyl. In this context, the United States have concluded only with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras Migration Agreements to join the migration at the south border of the United States to Mexico.
Justice orders release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
A Orang-Utan women has been sent to the requests of the argentinian justice from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a station for human affairs in the United States. In 1986, "Sandra" born in Rostocker Zoo, the rights of a "non-human person" were accused, so it was forced to release them. The animal was brought in direct flight to Dallas, however, not as passengers, but in the frachtraum, as advocate Andrés Gil Dominguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of harmful human beings are not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, it will live in the freedom of the Centre for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orang-Utans and 31 shimpans, including "Bubbles", before the home animals of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before incoming in Florida, "Sandra" must have a 40-day quarters in Sedwick County Zoo in Wichita in the United States Kansas.
"Sandra" delivered after its birth in Rostock a few years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsen Church before it was delivered to Buenos Aires. The 2014 process made by animals designed by "Sandras" basic rights has contributed to the transformation of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopage. To 2023, there will be a research and educational site for the enjoyment of the species.
Record for Swiss Extremberg steps: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extremberg growth Dani Arnold has made a new household road at the nearly 3000 meters high wave in the Italian alpes.
Without networks, double grounds or other help tools, the Swiss wined the 550 meters high north wall of the large wall in a new record time.
Cleaning with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supporting absolute freedom of wheat, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the growth. That is what he offers the oldest mark about about 19 minutes.
Arnold is now recorder in Free Solo Speed at four of the six most significant walls.
Nike benefits from a new online processing strategy
The US Sport Artist Nike has noticed the trade conflict with China. The net winning has increased in the past quarter to 1,4 billion euros (approximately 1,3 billion euros). This is 25 per cent more than in the previous year, as the concern reported on Sunday. This is why the new construction strategy "Nike ́", which the adidas competitor is directly referring to his customers.
The circuits increased to 10,7 billion in the three-night period until the end of August. On the most powerful, the Nike sales payments increased with a plus of 22 % in China. This was the benefit of the concerns from Beaverton in the United States of Oregon in the United States of Oregon to address themselves directly over the Internet or the artphone applications to the consumers.
Financial leader Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to provide the "digital transformation" of the sports article manufacturer and thus develop its competitive benefit. The investors reacted satisfactoryly to the quarter numbers - the actions of the sport article manufacturer increased by more than five pro.
Lifelong Stadium Prohibition for Rassism in Italy
Because of racial comments on the football profile Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the United of the Italian capital has declined a long-term stadium prohibition against a fan. The Brazilian defenseman Jesus was devoted from the fan on Instagram. Jesus published the private news and invited his club to take measures. "@officialasroma You know already what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Be sure who I am," wrote the 28-year-old man who played at AS Roma since 2016.
The United States reacted on Thursday. He reported the Fan's account at Instagram and Police.
Rassismus is a problem in the Italian football. The Italian fans regularly scandalise racial impunities against black players of rivalising people. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify the responsibility and remove from the stadium," President Gianni Infantino said the weekend. The exhibition was racial in the first party between Atalanta Bergamo and the Florence on the first Sunday.
However, about the attachers of Juventus Turin, there were recent discussions. The Italian authorities now have 38 randalizing fans of recordmaster Juventus Turin with stadium prohibitions. Four of them were not able to take the stadium for a period of 7/years, they shared the police.
The fans are associated with running investigations against 12 leaders of Ultra-Fanc groups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are included in a severe pressure, money weight and private violence. The club had brought the investigations with an indication of the last year.
The Ultra leaders would have to put after Italian media reports behind the Black Trade with Tickets. They would have "militerally controlled" the ticket trade for the Fancurve and would have pressed Juventus workers in order to reach more favourable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different than generation Y?
Millennials are nazistic, the generation Z is political - all the years of age are thrown up with critical names. Seeing more precisely, the expressions are full of opposition. How well are these labels described by the relevant sense of life of young people?
"The cancers come!" This call started on September 21, official of the cables on the Gucheng See in Gaochun, including the 19. China Gaochun Gucheng Lakehalt Festival was endorsed as the Department for Public Work of Nanjing Gaochun.
Gaochun, who is the southern distributor of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental areas. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city is in a environmental view of ideal conditions with a mixing of "30 Protà mountains, 20 Pro > Water areas and 50 per cent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers his people all conditions to become rich.
The people in Gaochun have already started in the early 1990s with the crabs. During the time, the cancer industry has developed to a famous brain, which cared for high income and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In the past years, Gaochun has actively developed a large, environmental and scientific development of crabs and a technology-building crab. The city has contributed to the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of agricultors.
In the past years, Gaochun has made a reform for the "distribution of power, optimisation of administration and authorities" and with concern the service network for "approvals under a deck, a team for criminal persecution, a network for services, a credit transmission platform"; this is what the city wants to optimize the environment of authorisations, services and development.

Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump responds
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return, spoke from the United Nations full assembly of an approved mandate to reject sanctions. The United States would, in contrast, have made an end of all sanctions, explained Ruhani on his official website.
The US President Donald Trump, however, opposed the Iranian officer on Twitter: "The Iran wanted me to put up the sanctions against him so that there was a meeting. Of course, I said no."
Ruhani sclerates the event so: the Federal Conceller Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and would have made a meeting place. "And America says I have taken up the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of criminal measures to be ended have been held to debate. "And they have clearly said that we have taken all sanctions."
However, this advantage is not made in a acceptable manner, criticized Ruhani.
In the beginning of the week, Kanzler Angela Merkel had met Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save atomic agreements with the Russia and China. This would stop the Islamic Republic to develop atomic weapons. The French president Emmanuel Macron had the hope that Ruhani would take place with the US President Donald Trump.
Hard landscape near Istanbul - fast 200 neighbors
After the west Turkey was shot within the latest time of two landbeaches, wê's at least before a catastrophe. 34 people were hurt in the landbeach on Thursday. Since the baby was given nearly 200 neighbors, the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This means the concern before a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed from security reasons, so hundreds of buildings were then protected. The earthquake of the power 5,8 on Thursday had broken the Marmary region before Istanbul and solved panic in the million meter pole. Now the Government wants to set a Commission in order to prepare the country better for the land, announced by Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey was not sufficiently prepared for babys, Istanbuls citizens Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the town itself, the latest will always be ignored. Each year, bad households are cut in - including murmure made by many smaller earthquake, which regularly shoot Istanbul.
Cities planners such as the Architectin Mücella Yapici have been warned since years that large open areas in the centre of refugees have been built longer. First to the 20th year of the Golcuk Baby in August, Istanbul's building room had warned that a million buildings in Istanbul were not insured.
The epi area of the bebe from Thursday was in Marmaameer before the circuit of Silivri and around seven miles depth, as the catastrophic protector of Afad reported. A smaller neighbor was a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbulian citizen Maester Ekrem Imamoglu shared Twitter with, hurt or damage, not reported. The State sentence TRT showed people who were driven from the households in the panic. Schools were brought from the buildings from the Silivri area. Some students weared as on images.
Istanbul is used as a particularly landscape. Under the Marmaramer is a section of the so-called North-Anatolic Suppung, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic earthquake. Turkey is still injured by earthquake. One of the most deadly was the baby in 1999 near the Istanbuls.
Scientists care that a earthquake of the power of 7.1 to 7.4 could be drowned. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclean. At the Thursday, it has already met the wests of the country and Istanbul.
Companies develop emergency plans, people have so-called Go-Bags packed with all the needs completely at the doors of households, and schools help children to take their own way when the earth wakes. When the next big baby comes, be unclear.
The Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were lost. Some buildings had easily lost damage. The Istanbulian citizen Maester Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbuler Catastrophen Coordinations ́rum (Akom). After its information, two minerals of Moscheen were cut into the regions Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning for neighborhood in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported panic. Constructions wackled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone guides were interrupted. It was more urgent than that from Tuesday, writes a user. The leader of the Turkish Red Halbmonds, Kerem Clinic, warned by Twitter before afternoon. He called people to stay away from buildings that would have lost visible skates.
The date of the beverage is given official information according to 13.59 hours (local time). Only a few minutes after the first beef, CNN Turkey stated that there was a neighbourhood that was specified by a power of 4.0 on the court scale.
First on Thursday, a earthquake of the power 4,6 has endangered the Turkish Marmarian region - it was to look until Istanbul, and its epi area has also been located in the west of the million meter pole in Marmare, and the disastrophen protection of Afad has already participated on Thursday.
It wasn't the only earthquake that cared for slight lines in this Sunday: Pakistan was also found by a severe earthquake.
Researchers conclude that it could come to a catastrophic landscape in Istanbul - the spending between the Tectonical plates is extremely high.Economy believe that it will sometimes be caused by disappearing and massive damage.
Agricultural researcher Sukrü Ersoy considers that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "These may be the signs of a greater earthquake," so Ersoy to the sender. "Previous or later the big baby will also come."
Just a few weeks ago, the baby had solved great concerns also in Istanbul. In Albania it had given a strong earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 losers. Also in the Earth’s sea he had made the earth.
Parliament: New wheel in Ukraine
Two brising documents provide for new injections in Ukraine for the potential misuse of the US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official procedure, the US democracy is strengthened: the complaint made by anonymous indicator on Trump and its constraint phone with the Ucrainian president is important for investigations against Presidents. Trump himself looks more than victims of a "Hexenjagd". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines Airlines Airport locked in Toilet - Fêer surrounded
Since a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight of the United Airlines was enclosed. The WC door was blocked during the flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline shared the US media.

The caker lake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan run with the whole brexit chaos? He writes a book on it - and his protagonist is inconvertable.
Inspired by Franz Kafkas of the famous story "The Conversion" of the British success, Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book on the Brexit Chaos in the United Kingdom.
The Roman "The Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on 27 November, shared the Diogene Verlag (Zürich). It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who has been ignored or hated in a previous life, but now the most powerful man is British. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in the fact and is willing to leave nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If the Parliament is closed, so that the government can not be asked at a critical moment when the Minister is lying unfairly like the Soviet leader when Brexiteers in high positions are to add the catastrophe of a no-deals - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write to.
Kafkas 1915 is first published by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up on the morning and looks "to an unfortunate injury" after and after family and society is excluded and is based on it. "Ian McEwan declines before Kafka to describe a world that stands on the head," he said from the diogenic district.

Thomas Cook: Rejected all travels until 31 October
The German traveller Thomas Cook has rejected all travels until 31 October 2019 on a day after intention requested. Travels could not be "for legal reasons," the company shared in the tax.
It also affects bookings of the Marks Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Booker Travels and Air Marin, already paid or paid. As it stands for traveling from 1 November 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the insurance, the other procedures will be examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany was held in the Sog of the British Mother Concern and had put in responsibility at the middlewoch innzantry. The company, including Neckermann Travels, eye Tours and Booker Travels, was employed in Germany about 2000 people.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels from now once again
Nevertheless, from this Friday, hotels in the outerland, which are currently cooking Thomas-Cook authors, will receive money from Zurich's security. The payments to the hotels are clearly linked to the condition that authors will not be requested for additional accommodations.
On the basis of booking information and without a model of separate accounts, the hotels in the holidays will now receive 50% of the exhaustive payments, as said by a Zurich speaker of the German Presse Agency. "This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately requested for individual payment of hotels or needed otherwise," speaker Bernd English continued.
The insurance reacted to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodations on their own place, and some had to put over 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Connection (DRV) and the Consumer Centres' Federation were critical.
How many hotels are affected, the Friday will be voted with the entrusted traveller, the insurance speaker said. According to Thursday, there were 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschaulers from Germany. The Zurich Germany has assured vacation and return to the Thomas-Cook Children.
In the administrators, they want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook communities in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the currently announced payments to hotels through the Zurich Insurance help only those who are still on the road. For Thomas-Cook kids who want to flight in the vacation, it looks bad. At the latest, the company shared all travels until 31 October. This also paid for such bookings already paid.
As it refers to traveling from 1 November 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the Insurance Insurance, the other procedure will be examined. Basicly, the security of Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels has been completed. dpa
The company refers to the surveyer Zurich that allows Kaera to represent. Customers may inform on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursement of the road price and make their applications applied on a web form.
Prince Harry Zero Sprengmine in日ola
Prince Harry continues the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he now walks directly on his mother's tracks.
The British prince Harry was dressed with a blue splitting west.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place Dirico, he set the roof circuit on Friday morning before running TV cameras. In a secure distant distance, the spring body exploded in the Savannaland, without damage. Although only the Halo Trust has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 min fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry then wanted to walk directly in the town of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same spreng master, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to leave the way she went at that time. The images on which princess Diana 1997 went through a free mine field were running around the world. She also had support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a dayly African journey beginning in the South African tourist metropolis Capstadt since Monday.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: A no-deals remain accurate
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson was clearly determined: with him it will not be guaranteed a suspension of Brexit negotiations, but what statements are forever in the political British times. The youngest judge of the Master Court in the United Kingdom is as a damoclean damage on the blondshop. His suspension of the Parliament to be able to carry out its brexit curs until the expiration date has been canceled in the beginning of this week. And a law, which was committed by Johnson, in the case of disappeared negotiations with the EU until 31 October, has been able to make an extension of the bilateral events.
Boris Johnson still holds a deal for possible
However, the pressure seems to be not able to pass to Johnson, while he has made an advancement of the negotiations in the case of a non-contracting case until the end of October:
You, we will keep on the law.
At the same time, we are convinced that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And the best with a deal, I'm carefully optimistic that it's going to go.
The time of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels is about six weeks. The EU and the British Undertaking Times have to prevent British exhibition from the European Union without agreements, but the latest talks have no longer reached a break. An agreement until the end of October appears to be difficult. If the British Prime Minister is not the Law, it is in force a new divergence of the date of exemption, but the opposition is not concerned by the words of the Prime Minister. You are afraid that Johnson could, in the case of a No-Deals, take the Brexit any way.
US recipients: More death accidents through E-scale
The number of death cases related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has been decreased at 12 years. Moreover, it has been occupied between 805 and probably damage in this context, the US-health CDC shared.

In Europe there is no similar growth of lens disorders. The disorders seem to be restricted to users in the United States.
The new protests in Egypt w.
The videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The builder in Spain lives and show players requests a "population" revolution. For the Friday he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which have critical corruption and misconduct. Ali hopes for mass-countries with a million participants at the central places of the country.
In the center of Kairos, there was already a strengthened police presidency. Many U-Bahn-St's remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir place were locked. In the past days, the police had strengthened their road controls and were partly searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On 20 September, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir place.
Last week, it came to Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to Protest with hundreds of participants. One such open protest had not been given in Egypt for years. The security forces correspondingly responded to it. According to the Human Rights Watch Organization (HRW) have been arrested since the last week of nearly 2000 people.

"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland-Expedition back
The Polar Forscher Arved Fuchs was returned on Friday from his Greenland-Expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburger City, including by the Skipper Boris Herrmann, the Greta Thunberg climate activist with the Renjacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of civilians, fuchs had examined and documented the effects of the warmth of Dagmar Aaen in the coasts of the Islands and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future Movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He expected a year ago that the young generation would be spoken to word. For years, you knew that the earth was sown. However, many acted as there was a planet B.
"What is on the sea, it often finds place excluding the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted people to inform the effects of the heat and the depreciation of the sea. In the expedition, inter alia, it was measured with a greenlandic glass cherry, and with networks after microplastics, it said.
For his "fight on a sustainable and respectful use of the World Sea" the Polyar Forscher from Bad Bramstedt in the Hamburger climate week with the "Seadevcon Maritime Award". "For us all who survive the Ocean in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example," Skipper Boris Herrmann said at the price delivery. "He is a witness of changes that have been made in the Arktic last years."
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for Nudeln 430 euros
430 euros for two Spaghetti Tellers with fish in a simple airport near Englandsburg in Rome: it seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. Although the account of 80 euros was paid by the two women, they put the exiting on Facebook, which exhausted hit reactions.
"Such cases damage the view of Rome. We ask the police to follow the question of whether this is a disturbance," a speaker of Federgit requested the association of travellers in Rome, the Roman journal Il Messaggero (Freeday issue).
Prompt came the response of the inhaber of the restaurant. The Japanese had not only commanded Spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner was justified. However, this is not to be taken from the account. A drink pay from up to 20% of the account was normal, the guest.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is caputed? The US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with the turbulent enths of the past days with an official procedure that the democrats want to check this with their research in the representative house as quickly as possible - the talk is from weeks until a decision would be fallen.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The proposal of the Whistleblower, who cared about the national security and the United States' democracy with its complaints, is a monster: The President has misuse his office to analyze the government of another country to influence the election of 2020. He has used Ukraine's dependency and wants to be so forced to act against a political enemy.
The novel of this presence is also to be completed in the intermediate middle of the talk with Selenskyj, although it doesn't repeat the complete term. The phone at 25 July is only a episode of a much larger story in which the center is near the Trump, especially his personal advocate: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the view of the public in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis travel plans reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiew with the same chosen President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very exactly that his intentions are healed. "We do not mix us into a choice, we meet ourselves in an investigation to which we have the right," he says the magazine. You can think it is unapproval, but "daran is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be followed in Ukraine, for which there is no basis - "for these information are very helpful for my clients and to be helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former New Yorker citizen master seem to have invoked with right offense fantasia, fixed on Trumps anticandidatin at the election of 2016: Hillary Clinton conspirated with actors in Ukraine, critics said that they could build an advice for the Russian investigations in the United States. However, this proposal was never serious.
This is exactly the investigations that the Trump will be spoken in July on the phone with Selenskyj. The version of Giulianis and the President is: the former vice-President and currently the prospective applicant for the presidential candidate of the Democracy, Joe Biden, has been able to put his son Hunter Biden as Ukrainian Government officer on the release of the Ucrainian general advocate Wictor Schokin. Although, in order to stop the investigation of the Gas firm, his son Hunter Biden was active. Byden senior has pressed the Ukraine financially to distort the corrupt powers of his family.
In fact, when Joe Biden requested that the Ucrainian general avocate should go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden had never been directly affected by it. Also, shokin was deeply determined that the US government was not at Weitem the only western partner who was forced to release. In addition, Obama Government supported even explicitly the investigations against the company.
Sounds at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive smiles at Instagram and Facebook. In particular, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. The user reports that Facebook has not been spent since approximately 15.30 hours. Also, Instagram reports that the contents could not be loaded. Whatsapp seems to be affected by the storage, even though it is not at the same time.
Instagram and Co.
It is not the first massive fall in this year. Just in March and July, the services were expired for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also take back this time, especially on Twitter to make their harm air.
Poland's economy protected in the Antarctica
Three polnical professionals were saved from the Chilean air weapons from the ice of the Antarctic. They were on the road and several miles away from their base when their engine refused. They had happiness in the disaster - less than one hour the Chilean salvation shooter needed for the mountain.
Eduardo Mosquera, Chairman of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"On 9:30 we received the message, so shortly before we were started, and 7/20 minutes we were guarding over the shooting boat."
Poland entered the King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 experts work there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Warning: §artphone NE Cabellos Upload
Practice but damage
Inductive technology through Qi standard is extremely practical, but it should not be used.
Since recently several new artphones have arrived on the market, which are cabellous uploading and very well exciting - all before the new iPhone-11 models, we want to call again a memory from beginning July. The cabellose loading of mobile devices is very practical, but not incondicionally recommended.
Higher temperature sets battery
Researchers warn before the cabellous loading of artphones. This means the recognition of the University of Warwick is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason is that the clearly greater warming development is. If a phone is normal per kabel, the accommodation is in three hours to 27 degrees. In the cabellos upload, the researchers themselves have a perfect alignment of the phone on the ladepad. Like the phone something close to the game, the temperature grows still. Moreover, the water strengths of the loadpad are increased, which renew the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to researchers, the temperature for the maintenance of the accu is a decisive Propertyor. So each degree plays a role. When loading with temperatures, the battery is not only to the capacity but also holds it all over so long. So the life duration falls less. The researchers suggest that the phone is always uploading by cabell. Since a battery on modern hardware phones is always connected to high costs, it must be a helpful tip. Apple has allowed to make the costs for a batteries even again - and even for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely comfortable: simply put the device on a suitable ladepad - they are even in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars installed - and the battery is uploaded without a lack of cabell salat and swimming stecker fibre. Since Qi (inductive energy transfer) is implemented a global standard, which can be exclusively Apple, there are no restrictions. However, the technology should only be used to researchers in the exception.
Everest state photograph: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Palestinian mountain grower has made its own information within only six months of 13 of the 14 highest mountains of the world. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manasual in Nepal and thus set a record, shared his expedition workers.
The former soldier wants to reach every 14 thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international lines: from him a photo of mountain growths that are on the Mount Everest Slange.
The picture of the mass advance solved a debate on a stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest spring of the earth. In May, 11 Cletters died within less days.
A problem for Purja could be the deal of the 14th thousand: Currently Chinese authorities lock the X ́bangma's beg in Tibet. As a reason, it is called a bad weather. First week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elefants found on Sri Lanka
One of the dead animals is also a tremendous elefant cuh, and a police speaker shared on Friday. "We believe that the elefants were delivered."
The four cadavers were found in a nearly 15 to 25 years of protection of the famous and of many tourists visited the previous rock festival of Sigiriya. The animals were urged by the police speaker from 15 to 25 years of age. It was ordered an autopsy to determine the cause of death.
On Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elefants are killed each year. The plants are often builders in which the animals had previously been kept in harmony. Eventually, about 50 people are killed by elefants each year. This is most happening when the animals go through near their lives.
In Sri Lanka, there is only about 7.000 elefants. Their murder is theoretically the death penalty.
Contained British oil tanker leaves the Iran
The British oiltanker "Stena Impero" leaves more than two months after establishing the town of Bandar Abbas by Iran. This was the flag of the bandar Abbas of the IRNA News Agency. The Iranian Revolution Gardens had the tenker running under British flag on 19 July under the prejudice to have missed the rules of the sea right in the Persian Golf.
Manage of Thomas Cook in Critics
The competent Economic Committee of the Subhuses wants to examine the position of the traveling guiant Thomas Cook, which is to take into account the maintenance packages of the representation as the question why the British Government could not contribute financially to the overliving companies. "Our interest applies to the supervision of the company as well as the control by external booking checkers," the Commission President Rachel Reeves in London. "We are obvious to do it with a bad example of managers."
Experts say Gene is overestimated in the risk of darm cancer
The role of the gene in the increased risk of darm cancer has appeared to be overestimated until now. This is the result of researchers of the German cancer area (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a current range. Other risk factors such as food-friendary habits are probably more difficult than until. This has consequences for the consequences of the individual damage risk, showing DKFZ sciences.
Elon Musk allows Tesla actions to increase
This wrote Musk in one of the Thursday (local time) published by the Branchen blog "Electre" e-mail to Tesla employees. The request is strong so that Tesla could buy 110'000 orders, he has continued to write in Musks.
The challenge is to bring the cars carefully to the science, which Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors reported the information: Teslas shares went with a plus of more than six Pro日 from the trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk brought records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver 360'000 to 400'000 cars. Thus, in the running and coming fourth year, six numbers have to be seen. In particular, the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are less delays. Despite the boom was lost.
Will the British Government handle Brexit-Legitz? Johnson retaining
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson seems to be covered by whether he is seeking the Law against an unregulated brexit, which he only said on Friday before journalists that his government will keep its right.
The Law provides that the Government must take a displacement of the expiry term until mid October, no agreement with the EU should be reached. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalisation law" which causes negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John ́or had expressed the consciousness that Johnson could try to use "political shape" in order to handle the law. Johnson could put a procedure stream that moves the entry into force of the law at the time after the EU's outcome.
Johnson said that he was seeking a Treaty with the European Union. "We are convinced to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Iran is obvious of Uran Riching High
Iran President Hassan Rohani, in the fight against the salvation of the historical Atomic Agreement, pressed the contracting partners. "Therefore, the states show incapacity or deficiency, when it comes to concrete action," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference at the border of the United Nations Voll Assembly in New York. In the case that they were not subject to their promises, he made "a greater steps" from the agreements of the urgently negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict with the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atom bomb, which, as contrary, included the attachment to Teheran to normalize the economic relations. The United States increased in 2018 to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change in the neighborhood policy considered aggressively. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with stronger arrangements and then replaced hard sanctions against Teheran. Iran also reacted with a re-reduction of the Uranian in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that the Islamic Republic now uses or has at least prepared for use with Uran in the beginning of September.
The Europeans may not be ready to take part of their deal and therefore let the Irans with the costs and the load of pressing US sanctions only, the mutest Rohani, but there will be further talks that hopefully take a solution.
Rohani continues to combat Iranian development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi-Arabia in the mid-September, Germany, France and Greece followed the U.S. estimation that Teheran was responsible for the attack. In the middle of the middle of the Iran, the Huthi revolves in Jemen were supported to the attack, but the United States were assessed as a misunderstanding. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position.
"The people who have raised such accusations must have proved that," said Rohani. "It would have not been known with him during the UN-General debat, but they would only have called on the fact that the rebels in Jemen could not take an attack like this. Rohani had been met in the past days with the Federal Conzler Angela Merkel, the President of France Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible interviews with the US President Trump, the US administration's large sanctions should be rejected, Rohani requested. He invited the Government in Washington to revise a dictionary of "dialog and understanding".
Come by other stars crossed solar system
Astronomes are currently watching a comet from the depth of the world Hall, which is the first time. The comet allows other solar systems to stop.
The first thing was a consciousness is now: a interstellant guest crossed by our sun system. The comet from the depth of the worldra was baptismed by discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has affected the interest of astronomes in the whole world.
The largest comet was discovered on 30 August by the Amateurastronom Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatorium on the Crime - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters of diameters. Notes of various observators not only reported that it was an unknown comet but also showed that it is not from our sun system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interestal object viewed by a flying of our sun system after 1I/'Uumamua of 2017.
2I/Borisov offers the rare opportunity for astronomes to get out of the nearly insight into an outer sun system before he goes out on a non-review. The first observations show that the interestal comet is like our own system, as reported by the astrophysical Institute of Canary. "The current speed of the comet is high, approximately 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia from the US Room Traveling Nasa in a communication.
The comet is based on the analysis of a so-called hyperbelway that produces it out of our system - and clearly intersternal origin, as the International Astronomic Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and category of the sky body. To honor his discovery, the interstlear swimster, which was previously carried under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, from her name 2I/Borisov, and the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interface object that is discovered in our sun system.
The astronomers have happiness: In contrast to 1I/'Oumamua, 2I/Borisov has already been viewed in the air. So the researchers remain a lot of months for research. "This object will get the greatest light in December and then be seen by average telescopes until April 2020," stated Farnocchia. "They will only be watching with more professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observators have already taken the survey. So a team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterisation of 1I/'umuamua, in a first study of the mediator of the heavenly object at 2 to 16 miles. The records of the Gemini-Observatories on Hawaii show a clear weight of the comet.
The researchers and researchers of the Canary Astrophysical Institute (IAC) have already won a so-called spectrum of the intersterial swimster that offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to the comets of our sun system, and it indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation is close to that cometenes in other sun systems could be formed by similar processes as in our, the León's college Javier Licandro.
The discovery of the same two interstlers within only two years, after assessing the IAU, indicates that these objects could open a new way to investigate certain processes in other solar systems. As often such steppers are, however, it is still difficult to evaluate. One of the next interstlers may eventually take a planned satellite mission of the low room travel tagging Esa.
The Agency wants to stand up to 2028 at a waiting position in 1,5 million miles away from the earth, the three-party space zone "Comet Interceptor" (a.k.a. comet-receptor). It will be made by Esa-Science Director Günther Hasinger, or on a still unattracted, fresh comet from our own sun system, or on an interestal sugar such as 1I/'Oumua.
First landing on Peking's new Mega Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is also: On the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, China's first passenger machine, a special honor for Captains and Crew.
To 2022, the new aircraft will be transferred about 45 million flightests annually, 2025 will be 72 million. China's President Xi Jin personally announced the extent of the 450 billion tore projects. The youngest Prestige project of China is also called "sea" because of his six-armed building structure.
The complex is over four start-up and landscape that will be extended later to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new U-Bahn transports passengers in only 20 minutes to the internal city of Pekings.
During the building, the Chinese have allowed several times to learn Berlin from Peking. The exhaust exhibition of the building since 2006 - and essentially smaller - the main city flights in Germany have been moved too long. However, after four years, in Peking a first passenger machine has been moved.
New overscale aircraft will fly 2030: In four and half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - from which the British Room Travel Agency is dreaming. It is possible that this, for the 2030s, flight shared in the overscale time (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, cited the Agency. "This is the technology that could finally operate," said the Agency Graham Turnock to the sender. "We talk about the 2030s for the enterprise, and the work has already been very progressed."
In order to advance the project, the British Room Taxing will cooperate with the Australien strongly. A flight from the British capital to the Australian Metropole is currently about 20 hours. As the only overcast aircraft for passenger transport, the Concord of 1976 to 2003 was covered by the streak of New York-Paris and used for it three to three hours. In 2000, Nasa was developing an overall aircraft on the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle at the start of the Paris Airport. In the past year, the United States Airport Lockheed Martin Planne, together with the U.S. Room Carrier, developed a superflying aircraft, which was "XPlaneack" in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with > High Speed-To-Punct-Transport", writes Reaction Engines, including on his homepage. The Sabre facility could be used with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as quick as the sholl. In addition, such aircrafts can be equivalent outside the earthmopher and allow the "on-generation really reusable raw vehicles".
Station in Washington: Trump wants anonymous tips in Ukraine
In the Ukraine business for the potential misuse of the US president, Donald Trump wants to track possible undue places in the White House.
"I want to know who has given the Whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday before the United States Guestship workers in the United States in New York. The person concerned is almost "a spion" and with such things you have been killed in the past "a little different" than today.
This was assessed as an injury trial against Tipp providers. The event was not public. However, several US media broadcast audio media on Friday. Democrates reacted to the President's opinion.
The Democrats in the United States representative House announced on Thursday preparations for an official procedure against Trump. In particular, their predecessors were published on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service employer, who had serious accusations against Trump and its government center. On a large public pressure, the divisions of the referendum were published on Thursday.
In the framework of his work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government workers, which the US President "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country is involved in its benefits in the US election 2020.
In the middle of the predecessors, there is a constraint phone between Trump and the Ukrainian President Woodymyr Selenskyj end July, in which the Trump encouraged his officers to investigate, which could damage the political rivalen Joe Biden, which is the former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine, and the practical efforts to shalt his prosssling before the Ukrainian Justice.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House with ack on the Ukraine phone also of the trial: leaders of government workers would have tried to maintain the precise interpretation of the speech under the cover. As usually a electronic vocabulary protocol was added. This would be, according to the order of judges from the White House, but from a normally intended database and was stored in a specially designed system. It was published only a gross talk protocol.
The "New York Times" reported that it was to be an external secret service employer.
Trump repeated on Friday the credibility of the source. In a series of Tweets to the subject, the President wrote, among other things, the "so-called Whistleblower" has broadcast information from the second hand that would have been inappropriate. Therefore, there may be no tips or spion.
As Trump expressed in New York about those who had to join the whistleblower information, but resolved the confusion. The president of the US representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted disappointed and complained that Trump's statement was more declined from the government's integrity.
Representative House has been conducted in various issues for months in various studies against Trump and its environment.
"The Whistleblower has given us a travel plan for our investigation," said the Chairman of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representative, Adam ship. Trump attacked the ship, gave him a wrong presentation of the things and asked him again to return the chairman's return. Trump was regularly shopping the ship and had requested his return for months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. Government workers from the security and external policies, who were mostly involved in democracy, but also among the Republican presidents, have been published in a released on Friday after the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible official derogation procedure.
For the next process, there is no precise time schedule, but most of them in the representative house could strive to the democracy a so-called impeachment process, but the decision on a real Office was fallen in the senate where the Trumps Republicans had the majority. The views of such a procedure are less.
VW Business Board: Workspaces are disbuilding "sleeping"
The VW mark's plans to continue to reduce the costs in the production could go to the loads of the manufacture in Germany and Europe. This concern triggers the operational council of the carrier. The mark wants to reduce its annual manufacture from ≥ billion euros to 2023 to two billion euros, which will have 500 million euros to be shared in this year.
A key to this is the staff. The "Income Pact" negotiated between undertakings and the Business Council 2016 has already seen the degradation of 14,000 workplaces only in Germany. Basicly, a workplace can be built on the carrier only if it is probably evident that the activities associated with it are no longer needed. In addition, a employment assurance is applicable until 2029.
As our newspaper now experienced from operational board circuits, however, workplaces in the production that are not available will be broken down on another way - so on the official course, so the free regulational stations would often not be restored.
In these cases, the Business Council has no opportunity to strengthen the rehabilitation. In the middle of the middle officials, it has failed to make work disturbance, the concerns would be greater than a global explosion of vehicles, so that the protection that the vehicle production could be removed after and after Germany and Europe because it is more favorable in other parts of the world. The VW only said: "A adjustment of the employment volume is as agreed socially under the demographic curve".
The VW mark wants to standardise the production worldwide and control new projects, which also allow costs and decisions to be reduced - is the aim of increased productability and so that the competitiveness can be increased. Andreas Tostmann's representative said on a Berlin Manager Conference: "With in the uncertain times from brexit to the threatening trade between the United States and China we are well advised to make us crucial."
In this way, it was already successful: For example, this year, they would first snippet the production of every vehicle in comparison to the previous year. Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which was to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg for reducing 1,1 hours. Exact numbers for production duration does not call VW, according to our magazine's information, it is at Golf 7 round.
20 hours.
In our region, the staff work Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which the vehicles are produced. The works of Braunschweig and Salzgitter makers. For Wolfsburg, the VW's internal rule applies to build 800,000 cars annually so that the work is satisfied. 2018 was the loading in Wolfsburg but only about 700,000 vehicles - consisting of the singing diel request and the problems in converting to the new consumption and gas testing procedure W.P.
As Tostmann has announced in the past year, however, in Wolfsburg "perspectively" will roll a million cars from the band. This will enable the assembly of Golf production in staff - because the work of Zwickau through the recycling to the location of the e-auto-production is the golf performance.
In Wolfsburg, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales payments of Golf and Tiguan were developed at the latest. Therefore, the expectations are now on Golf 8. He must, despite all efforts to build e-mobility, remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburgers.

If the company does not return to the negotiations, the company will "inform on 14 October on the work campaigns in the LH-concerns", the Ufo Tarif Representative Daniel Flohr shared on Friday. Airhansa and its daughter Eurowings have refused to lead to Ufo Tarif negotiations for months, and it is also the question of whether the company has legally cancelled tariff contracts in the aircraft.
In this case, Ufo has been strengthened after a decision of the Court of Justice of Frankfurt. Airhansa wanted to find out that the tariff contracts were not canceled. The Court denied the applications. The Company was able to make the decision and checked to introduce the rights.

U.S. Federal Government Warning against Huawei
The leader of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," Pai said to the "Handelsblatt" with a shock on the building of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which commits each company to follow the instructions of the security bodies.
The applicable law is also prohibiting companies to inform third parties of such questions," as FCC head continues, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
Instead, the Federal Government has agreed to request the suppliers a "certificate clay" of confidence.
Berlin wants to try to control the risks, such as with technical solutions, reports the "Handlesheet" by vocational information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not only out of the hardware:
The software is currently important to keep the devices in the latest position. This software consists of billion lines of program code that change with time, said Pai.
It is very difficult to imagine, that a Governing Participant, "where it would be able to check each individual update in real times to detect security risks", as the FCC head continues.
The Chinese Concern Huawei provides close contacts with the Chinese State Appartement:
The owner's conditions are unexpected, and the worker company, which is relatively part of the company, is not independent of the Government," Pai said to the "Handlesblad".
The United States provides recognitions where government workers were located within the company. Pai was recently for a talk in Berlin to replace the position of the United States.

Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson weight question about Brexit Tactic
The British Premier Johnson criticizes the "Capitalisation Law".
The European Parliament is back, a law proposes to the British Premier to avoid a chaos breach, but criticians, however, ensure that Boris Johnson could use a noise, and call on this possibility, however, that the Tory Policy is a weight of the political.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson seems to be covered by whether he wants to implement an unregulated breach, despite the latter law of Parliament, which is to prevent it.
The Law provides that the Government must take a displacement of the expiry term should not have reached agreements with the EU until mid October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalization law" which causes negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John ́or had expressed the consciousness that Johnson could try to use "political shape" to execute the law. The Premier could use a procedureline that moves the entry into force of the law at the time after the EU's outcome. Johnson said that he strives to make an agreement with the European Union. "We are convinced to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the way with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Counciler Dominic Cummings explained that he felt the political debates about Brexit as "spacing in the park" and proved to be convinced that the EU's outcome is still in state: "We will enjoy it, we will win (e.g. Red.: out of the EU), no worry," said Cummings of the British magazine "Telegraph".
Cummings, who led the Brexit "Fote Leave" campaign during the election battle before the EU Referencendum 2016, now works as a leader in the British Government Session Downing Street. He is going to put behind the uncompromissed which has led the Premier into a little unexpected situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood before the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it must not always be the great Glamour. The photobook "The Polaroid Diaries" (boats) is deep in the entire private world of McCartney's family.
Paul McCartney, who was married with her from 1969 to Lindas' death in 1998, was obviously surprised when he presented the "The Polaroid Diaries" image band in the middle of September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrated guests also belonged to Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Presidents of Chrissie Hynde.
After the Launch Event McCartney at Instagram wrote: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a flexible cup in the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the consent of LindaMcCartney as an engaging artist and the sofort magic of the polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied the art history at the University of Aōna until it found a photograph, the camera was always at the place. Thousands of polaroids have made it, some hundreds of them are now published first in the "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, still lives, landscapes, several Hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "You wanted real moments," writes the artistic Ekow Eshun in forehead.
Since he and his daughter Mary were on the woods, he phoned in the bathroom with a cup on the head or carrying an unformed moonboots. Of course, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but on the side of the light light on their farm in South England or in Scotland also led a very normal life. So Mary McCartney sounds BBC that she would have slept as a baby in a bed that her father had bought from old cartoffles. And it was not always cleaned at the McCartneys.
Like nearly another media, the Poloraid camera starts the immediate moment. The records of Linda McCartney are probably a kind of family journal, but they are much more than pure snippets.
It's about the determined click: You have to recognize if you have a great picture before you. And then you have to pick it up at the exact moment, " Paul McCartney said, "If you're kicking two seconds later or two seconds ago, it could be a completely different picture." And Linda would have had had to have had to take the gift always exactly the right moment. "You knew just that she had it," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
The light is true, the composition, the image output and the colors, which "The Polaroid Diaries" does not only make a sustainable picture book for Beatles-Fans, but, above all, it is also a great esthetical pleasure, where lands are already acting as abstracts. The perfect completion of the Beatles-album "Abbey Road", which has occurred exactly 50 years ago.
"We'll continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country, despite the United States sanctions against Iran. The Turkish president Recept Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot cancel the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our land gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the United Nations Voluntary Assembly.
However, Erdogan noted that Turkey had problems in importing Iranian Earth Oil, since some companies would have returned "for the US's movements".
However, Turkey will continue our relations with Iran "in this and in many other issues," said the Turkish President who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States have followed a "maximum pressure" from the international atom agreement with Iran against the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, the Iran has followed a atomic programme in secret and does not follow the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the infringement of the Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran.
US government wants to prevent the capture of refugees
The US Government wants to entering refugees drasticly. The US Foreign Minister explained on Thursday that the annual border of a renewal programme should be seized from now 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a 40% range.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that the United States would continue to see the support of refugees, but the most important task is to smite the US citizens and serve them. The US immigration system is currently overloaded.
The US Government will promptly conceive the collection of two refugees groups: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Irakers who have helped the US Military in the country and have been invoked in such a way as resulted from the External Ministry. From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to be taken to maximum 1500 refugees.
In 1980, refugees from United Nations stores worldwide are selected and resigned to the United States. The top limit of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current top limit of 30,000 is a deep value. When the US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left, the number was at approximately 85,000.
Help organizations reacted to the announced decline of the top border. "This is a very traumatic day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, and the United States would continue to harm their role in protecting the most vulnerable people of the world.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the United States - legally as illegal. The US government expects its own information for the next budget year 350,000 asylum applications. These numbers are recorded by the renewal programme.
Donald Trump - "Come near a shot"
The US President Donald Trump has regarded indicators in the whistleblower business of the spionage. Anyone who has given the informant who has forbidden to use power misuse, "come a spitsel near," Trump sounds a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. This reports more US media correspondingly.
Thus, Trump said before the United Nations mission workers. When he was asked for the person who informed the whistleblower about the white house-conflicted actions, he answered: "This is a shot near." Then Fêe Trump added: "You know what we have done in ancient times when we were blind? Right. The spion and the consequence that we had to do so a little differently."
The observers showed the last note of a possibility of the death penalty. The democrats practiced criticisms to Trumps and offered him an enforcement of witnesses. It is also a trial to prevent a congress investigation on a possible official procedure against him, writes the presidents of the Committee on External, Secret Services and Representative House.
The Whistleblower proposes to the President in a currently published complaint that his office was missing in order to invite a mixture of another country to the US election 2020. In particular, it is about his remote phone with Ucrainian colleagues Woodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the case of the Trump put him near, investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump strives to every manage.
It is still unexpected who the whistleblowers are and who are his informators. However, as reported by the New York Times, the whistleblower should be an analysis of the foreign secret service.

According to the "Financial Times" WeWork has concluded between contracts with periods of periods of up to 15 years, from which commitments are made of more than 40 billion billion. These big commitments could be not only for the company itself and his investors but for the whole immobility market.
According to the economy Dan Alpert from the Course Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhatten, one of the highest immobility markets of the world, in the past 24 months at least 300,000 square meters of office. Only WeWorks new contracts ensured that the request for offices in New York was greater than the new areas on the market at this time. Without Weorks Expansion, the Offices in the US Metropole would have been located in this time, as Alpert wrote in "Busness Insides". Similarly, it looks out in London where WeWork was in the midst of several thousands of Office standards in the best place.
Also in the British main city, the balance of the immobility could be identified without further expansion of the aggressive startup. In addition, WeWork is the main medium, in one of the past year by Sparkassen fund supplier Deka for almost 100 million euro Office covered in the centre of the financial metropolis.
Settert WeWork to make his business model soon profitable, the immobility owners had to replace a part of the expected billion incomes. Access to the - without the button - Reserves of WeWork, they did not, despite the long-term contracts. For the approval of individual sites of WeWork is usually made by each extra funded daughters, such as special Purpose Vehicles for which the mother society has only held in a single limit.

New climate Proteste of Fridays for Future
One week after the greatest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go back to the street for more climate protection.
For the end of a international climate week, the movement Fridays for Future rebuild action and Kunworks in Dutch countries worldwide. The beginning of the time testing New Zealand and ́s before the protests moved over Europe to North America. There the climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to share in a highlight in Canadian Montreal. Instead, before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather themselves.
How big the world's attachment to this Friday after the story of the previous week, it is relatively unclean. Thunberg himself was good things. "The last Friday, more than four million people have done for the climate. This Friday we're doing it again!", she wrote on Twitter. Too long it has given action in 170 countries in the streek week.
In Germany the past Friday was very large. A third of all worldwide demonstrants - approximately 1,4 million - were shared by Fridays for Future in 575 German cities in the Protests. This time a list of movements are planned in at least 65 cities. Including Metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and Köln, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Yuchen in Northern Western or Westland, people want to go to the street.
At the age of 15 years, Thunberg was set before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to invite the people of their country to increase the use of climate protection. This has been the Friday-for-Future movement within a short time. The climate Protests, especially students and professionals, but at the latest, also actors and other adults.
Commonly, they call for more honor in the fight against the emergency and the suspicious climate disasters. In particular, according to Paris’s climate agreement, the global warmth must be under 1,5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial time.
Thunberg came nearly a month after a two-week transatlantic tunnel with a high-see rainjacht in New York, where she had recently shared in climate Protests and the bulbs of the United States. On Monday, she held a emotional talk in which she spoke increasingly to the State and Government head of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, she was accessed to its use for more climate protection of the alternative Nobel price of the right Livelihood stabilition.
Russia prohibits smoking on the Balcony
The people in Russia may not be able to breathe on the Balcony. This is a change in brand protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a speaker of the Ministry of Needs on Thursday in Moscow of the Tass Agency in Moscow. The prohibition will enter into force on 1 October.
However, a person who smokes must then calculate a penalty of 3.000 Rubel (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should devote a fire, the penalty falls out. Under the prohibition, the Ministry falls as well as burning wheels.
Switch against Cyber Crimeal - Unexpected Server
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators first have made a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
In total, 13 teats are in the contention that as a county operator in an ancient Nato-Bunker in Traven-Trarbach on the Mosel, many web sites have been handled over the international criminals who have committed their powers.
This shared the General State advocate in coblenz. Seven facts were arrested at a large action on the morning. The darknet is a secure part of the Internet.
The clients of the fact-conscients, including the operators of the worldwide largest Darknet market place for Property, "Wall Street Market" - had destroyed investigators in the early year. In addition, the attack on 1,25 million Telecom-Ro end November 2016 was reported by the General State advocate over a server in Cyberbanker.
A such host was first exhausted in Germany. A webhoster provides the infrastructure for a Internet presentation.
The access action with support of special units such as the GSG9 has been conducted in Germany and nearby foreign investigations, which have been resulting from almost five years of investigation. On midday, the investigators want to inform more details.
New World climate Protest of Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people today want to go back to the streets for more climate protection.
To conclude a international climate dishweek, the movement of Fridays for Future renewed action and Kunworks in Duty countries worldwide.
In Germany Protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in Metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and Köln, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Yüchen in North Rhein Westfalen or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-time in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate Protest ✔ Who are Thunberg's interlocutors?
Justice and courage are high tugends, even in the 21th century, in a world full of wars and smoke factors that produce the climate. More surprising that a 16-year girl calculates the powers of the people this time holds the spiegel before the nose. But what is behind? Is it helping or wise decreasing a climate activist? History mastership or manipulating tactics about her own?
On the other hand, Greta Thunberg makes the mass movement and brings young people up for a better climate friendly world. It is historically not seen the first time in Europe that a young man creates a collection of children and youths for themselves. In 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Köln has felt exhausted to use himself for a righteouser world. Then this has also been able to win a shadow of young people for themselves and it has convinced to overcome the sea to get into the loving country, like Greta Thunberg has recently made it to travel to America with a sealboat.
But there is a shadow page? Why does it take an action called "We don't have time" to save the world? Besides, Greta Thunberg has a rich PR-Manager at its side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has been greatly excited, thanks to the daughter in the light of the ramp. Even old-building followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disturbed over the last PR-show, or. The travel with the boat was also set to dick. This is also not unfair, because the action came in the media very well to the world, and it flows much money thanks to the imposing action.
Now the spirits are separate: Is it morally proper to discipline in the judgment of the world? Is it still authentic if some persons work together during the world salvation action with breast-feeding machines? All the same position is strictly implied that a critical and reflected viewpoint is still more important in a democracy-determined society, since the democracy leie of various opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can also be aware of the critical and reflective viewpoints of certain trends.
Comet discovered: Interestal guest crossed by our sun system
A foreign comet is currently crossed by our sun system.
The pollution of the astronomes has occurred: a foreign comet crossed our sun system at the moment - it is only the second of his species.
Garching/Washington - longer researchers have just thought it, but now they have certainty: a comet of another star crossed our sun system at the moment. He was baptized by discoverer 2I/Borisov and was just busy astronome worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomes on the crisis
The accurate body was discovered by an amateur astronomy named Gennadi Borissow on the Crime. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and other observations made his first deceit. It is actually an unknown comet that is not from our sun system. He is only the second of his type that was viewed during the flying.
The great opportunity for astronomes is now to get out of the nearby insight into a foreign sun system. The comet is obviously similar to our own system, as reported by the astrophysical Institute of the Canary. The comet is aware of the International Astronomical Union (IAC) of a clearly interestal origin and is currently moved to a so-called hyperbelway that brings it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before the flight - and can be observed several months
But before it is so far, the astronomes can watch him in entrance. In contrast to the predators, 2I/Borisov has already been viewed in flight, which means that he can be investigated for many months from the earth. "The object will get the greatest light in December and then be seen by average telescopes until April 2020," says Davide Farnocchia from the United States Room Room Traveling Nasa. "Therefore October 2020 it will only be watched with greater professional telescope."
The former of the new reader: 1I/2017 U1 "umuamua".
First recognition of Comet 2I/Borisov Wake Hope in the Community
According to the first recognition, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 miles. At the same time, the heavenly body seems similar to our comets - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León is the spectrum of the swimster is similar to ours. This observation is close to that comets in other sun systems could be formed by similar processes as in our, supplemented by the León College Javier Licandro.
However, the observation is outside of specific recognition, and that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years allows a new way to investigate certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are always busy to the researchers. In the past, a rice asteroid passed over the earth and came close to her.
"Absolutely rejectable": Rachel Johnson's resentment for brother
For Boris Johnson it's going to be unique. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister gets the chief language of the Premier with clear words as "freely". It's not the brother whom she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", "Contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still under pressure and keeps on - at least verbal. At the hour in the middle of this middle-week, it puts it on a massive confusion of opposition, and there are also other critics reported in terms: Duty Bischöfe and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The journalist and author said to the sender Sky News, her brother used words such as capitalation, as if the enemies of an EU output should be "arranged, divided, fired, and edged". You believe that it is overwhelming. You don't recognize the version of her brother again, Rachel Johnson, which was held at the choices of the EU parliament for the Anti-Brexit-Partei "Change UK".
She insisted that her brother Jo Cox, a EU-friendly sub-human deputy, who was killed by a Neonazi Referencendum in 2016, and whose other ones could be honested at the best by translating the brexit, Boris Johnson said in the underhouse. "It is very unfortunate to take a deputy that was killed by someone who called the first", criticized Johnson's sister. The damner was obviously coming from the right-extreme camp, which was "increased by this kind of language". For everyone who had treated them, it is very ungrateful.
Also the Witwer of Cox criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick if Jos Name is so useful," he twittered. The best way to honor them is if you were suffering and deceived for the entrance in which you believe - whatever you think is. But you never need to demonise the other side." He also lamented that an atmosphere had occurred to become more likely in the attacks.
Before a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson younger brother Jo had submitted his office as a State Secretary and his mandate as a Tory Deputy. "I was broken in the past months between loyalty to family and national interest - it's an unresolvable spending," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language was also in the Church to criticize. As the "Times" reports, all 118 Bishops and Erzbischöfs of the Church of England criticize the language that "This country is not worth." In a common statement they explained, "In the past days, the language is not acceptable, both in discussions and outside the Parliament. We should speak with respect."

A visual player and Youtuber makes Egypt's ruler: First, Mohamed Ali remains in the foreign.
The two men who have influenced whether on the streets of Egypt reflowed blood have passed the last week in the outerland. One of the two weeped again on Friday to the Airport of Kairo. State president Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the United Nations General Assembly. The ex-General, the Muslimbrood Mohammed Mursi, who was the first chosen State overseer of the country, had taken a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had made Sisi action against the political islam and no silver over the human rights loss in the Nil - in a week in which hundreds of Egypt's security forces had been arrested because they had intended to protest against the Presidents. He had "Not lost money on the human rights in the Nil" in the Microphone.
In the mistake, it is attempted to be arrested by the president of another man, who has now set the event on the streets. Mohamed Ali remained self-determined in the foreign, where he dismissed the access of the security forces that would soon be arrested when he tried to come into Egyptian lands. A week ago, the 45-year player was just a minority of the Egyptians. Today he is the tone indicating voice that the political talk in the cafés, the residence rooms and the teasure of the country: With Youtube-Canal "Mohamed's secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
He goes to the Governing Boss directly and through Russian language. As the people are hungry, the President in Luxus and lets himself build beautiful new palaces, it says. The military management on the Sisi's government provides Ali corruption and areaization. Because he has made a two-covered builder for 15 years with exactly these gentlemen of business, he seems to know exactly what he speaks - that is at least the impression of many Egyptians, as they show just the clicking numbers to explode.
After the last week after Sisis Griff after the power of thousands of people had demonstrated his rulership and nearly 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights and opposition policies, were arrested, Ali called for this Friday to a "million-march". That would really take so many people on the streets, it was unlikely. However, there was a conciliation of smaller protests, such as Giseh in Cairo and in China in Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose shareholders Al-Sisi Corruption and requested the outcome. In these protests, the police also placed trees and goumic geoses. These videos were not even independent.
From the town of Mansura in Nildelta, where most demonstrants were spent with the president's portrait, the massive police presidence was reported on the Friday. Safety forces created checkpoints in the city and on the outside streets. In Kairo several U-Bahnsts were closed in the city because of "Retentional work", the most streets around the Tahririr place, the heart of the revolution, were blocked. And on the Rabba-Location, on which the attacks of the disappeared muslimbrother Mursi were dismissed until the army took them under fire and killed them up to 800 people, should prevent another measure that it would be unfriended: Sisis's future party wanted to calculate a majority for the president.
Mohamed Ali foretold these proposals to a change in his tactic: "Our goal must not be the tahrir place," Ali said in Barcelona in his videocamera. "Let us not join with police officers." But as backwards, it is not to understand: "Ganz Egypt is the Tahrir Place."
If the Provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be more slower than the provider, there are different test options.
Whoever terminates a Internet contract does not need a blind trust in the speed information of the provider. Customers can check how much of it is actually achieved.
The previous transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the consumer center Bayern.
If the connection appears to be very slower than the Provider, there are various test options. Thus the media tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) meet the actual data transfer rates and compare them to the rate agreed in the Treaty.
"The tests of the suppliers are, however, performed in accordance with specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," gives the consumer central Bayer to be considered on their side.
If the connection is significantly lateer than announced, customers can set a suitable time to the provider for 14 days in order to make the pronounced service. This makes those concerned the best in writing by input.
If this does not do anything after multiple requests, customers can announce and, in circumstances, request damage rates, but, in the remaining success, only help the road of claims.
First structural republicans for the investigation

Scott said that he was not surprised by enthings that Trump repeated the Ukrainian President Woodymyr Selenskyj on a phone call to investigate the interventions of the Democratic President and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump watched the offers for "years".

Green Politician must be responsible for a penal photography panel
The Chef of the Canadian Green, Elizabeth May, was manipulated by this reason of the bechers?
The Canadian Green Chef holds a photo of a multi-way beach in the hand. But now it comes out: The becher was manipulated.
Ottawa/Kanada - It is quite long unobserved - and finally up. The reusable coffee beacher with metal strohhalm has Elizabeth May, the Chef of the Canadian Green, never held in hand. On the site of the party, she was to see a photo with this beker, in conversation with the citizens. However, the photo was already published and was broadcast to the media - and there the beacher was still a shadow (Papp) Becher, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chef must be responsible for the photo pane
The National Post, therefore, forwarded the Manipulation and that the Partie Fake News produced to appear more reliable in the "Environment Protection" theme, and that in the middle of a choice battle for the subhuman election, in which Trudeau also was very difficult because of an improvement channel.

Influencerin wants free upgrade: Liveslange flight prohibition in Cathay
At the same time, Jaqueline Ng per mail of Cathay Tierify has been guaranteed a update. But when she asked at the check-in, she didn't be able to be on the board - and she would never be able to flee with Cathay again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the Business Class - there are many flighter dreams. Sometimes they have happiness, and the workers at the check-in offer a free exchange from the Economy Class.
However, this case shows how you should not do it: A self-explained influencerin requested the Airline Cathay actively for a free upgrade. Instagram follows Jaqueline Ng more than 65.000 users. On 30 May, it was refugiated from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June.
At the flight, Jaqueline employees refused to update, although she had presented a mail in which Cathay established it appeared to have a update. The writing would have received the influencerin from a Marketing worker in Airline. The airline has been accused of Jaqueline to have the mail age.
At the backflow, Jaqueline was trying to get a upgrade for the long-stream flight. This time the woman would have shown the same mail, however with another reference number. The JFK flight employees were skeptic: you have hacked at the center. And actually, the employee from which the mail appears to have interrupted the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also helped the mail system where the messages were not found.
Airline workers cancelled Jaquelines ticket on the aircraft and detained a livelihood of flight prohibition with Cathay. For $1.400 (EUR 0), she had to buy a new aircraft to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencerin returned to Elliot Advocacy, a company who represents consumers, because Cathay had replaced her price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also requested the costs for the new ticket.
However, while Jaqueline does not introduce the mail metadata, the case remains clear: For Cathay has committed the influenzarin disorder, it remains locked for future flights. Airline's business conditions also assume that they do not have to solve the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to satisfy it - and now enable an advocate.
