New Questions on the Californian Water Project
Criticals and State lawmakers say that they want to know more about who is paying for a 16 billion dollars supported by the Governor Jerry Braun, a project of 16 billion dollars after leading the representative of the Californian Water Manufacturer, who said that the Braun administration offers a government funding to finish two large water tunnels.
Criticals claim that the financing of the government described in the water management of Los Angeles metropolis may occur in contrast with the long-term state claims that different water management, not California themselves, would pay for Braun's vision two like 35 tonnes in order to renew water to the south of the Sacramento River, mainly Central and South Califórnia.
Initial expenditure for the building of tunnels in 248 million dollars, which are still to be subject to the authorisation of the supervisory authorities, has already been initiated an investigation of the federal audit.
Thursday, the State laws sent a State audit on the expenditure of tunnel buildings.
Fourth day, stated Nensia Vogela, that, despite the metropolis water management account in Los Angeles, money will not be used for the end of two tunnel planning phases from the public general budget.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of payers were critical fourth day, and the representative of the Assembly Suzana Ega, one of the remaining state audits sent after this week, requested the State decrees.
"There's a game with buyers," said David Volfs, the legal director of the Association of payers of Havard Jervisa.
I think that it's combined with a dinner audit (advice): there's much more questions than answers.
The Tunnel project is a Braun and some political impact on water management and water consumers in Central and South Califórnia.
Supporters claim that tunnels will be well-environmented and will protect the potential of more potential water.
The opposers claim that they are able to see that the State will use tunnels to get too many waters from the River Sacramento and San Francisco, to threaten Northern California and to more threaten the species.
Metropoles and other water-speed management, intended to receive water from the tunnel, must still be approved to be paid because of the insurance of whether the investment of milk funds gives sufficient water to be paid.
They also announced this year that they would not be paid for the end of the correct preparation work, unless the project does not monitor the authorisation of the authorities.
Thursday, the report on the Tunel project published by the Water Management of Los Angeles is stated that "the state has shown that additional funding for the end of the planning phase will be granted from the State or the federal budget".
After all that the water management has exposed to the project, including $63 million from its water management, "and expectable" that the State will use the national money to finish the planning," said Bob Moirs, the Los Angeles water management.
Then he discussed the questions to Vogel, the State Spiker.
Vogela said that the State is planning to grant money to finish tunnel planning from the existing half-yearly old water network, the State Water Project.
However, tunnel construction opponents would issue a regulatory regulation in 2009, which, after it said, provides for the public to bear money tunnels until the waterscape institutions that benefit it will not take payment obligations for them.
"The project party has promised to pay for this project, and they have used financial tricks to deal with these commitments," said Patricia Chiferle, the environmental consultant and the old planned tunnel opponent.
This causes questions about where this money was recently found.
Assessment of the Business Group in relation to the Chinese Cyber Research Act
The International Business Group Coalition has been aimed at changing the proposed cyberprotection rules in China by warning that they are threatening trade and isolated by the country.
The newspaper of the Chine Premier Minister Li Kecianem has signed 46 groups from the United States, the European, Asia and Latin America, showing global concerns that the provisions may limit or stop access to the China Security Products Market.
In the middle of the signatures, the United States Market, the European Services and the Groups of Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules provide that producers should show the Chinese authorities how security products work and as a country the information on the citizens of China.
The last letter dated Thursday states that this data collection could make it easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical in Tianjina: Since the last year of tragedy
Zhangs Mengfan states that it is worth knowing what happened in Tianjina.
The Chinese leaders are planning a clear memory measures to mention a wide range of chemical disorders in which 173 people were lost on the first day of the year, however, not all agreed.
John Sadworth reports from Tiangin.
Anywhere in the world would be the time that the people remembered and remembered.
However, not in China.
In addition, there is a memory service in the Taijian city for the memory of some dead firewaters, other than those memory measures are exhausted.
The media controlled by the Communist party have been stated what they can and what they cannot say, and some of the survivors, as well as the members of the damage, have been warned not to speak to the president of the State.
However, the 23 - year - old Zhangs Mengfan does not want to obey.
"In this year, you've got something to know what happened," he said.
I don't want obedience.
On 12 August, Zhang was a radio operator in the military firewall, which was only a kilometer away from the epic.
"The call was received tomorrow at 22.53, and we started sending my commands," he said.
Instead of the event, they could take place in 10 minutes.
Deleting the broad-breed chemical substances in the depth is also placed in orders from other cities.
None of them noticed that illegally stored a lot of air and toxic substances, exceeding the quantities allowed and also without appropriate monitoring.
The fire flow began when it was allowed that nitroceluloses - naked chemical substances are used - the partie was cut off and then caused the fever.
Then it was spread in a large area -- to 800 tons of amonia nitrate.
In the campaigns, the windows and the firewall depth, where Zhangs Mengfan waited at a radio range of news from the event site, were injected.
This message wasn't received.
"When I saw the seed arts, I fell in the midst," he told me.
I knew what that would mean to my friends.
From 26 his units of fire, which were sent tonight to the stream, eight would never return.
Many others have been able to severe inflammations and other injuries.
The largest of the two big springs were placed on the earthquake, and the spring was feeling a lot of kilometers away.
The total loss amount is covered by more than 1 billion dollars, including over 300 ruined buildings.
In general, 173 people were lost, from whom 104 were firewaters.
Eight people’s deaths are not found.
The official Government's investigation authorities are equally offended by corruption, political relations and official hidden agreements, as a result of the ensuring and ignoring security systems.
For the first time, there was no need to build a nearby home.
More than 100 officers and representatives of the company's manager have been initiated by discipline or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the Government is able to indicate the progress - thousands of houses and conditions for citizens in order, these issues are current.
The tragedy is returned in the system of flash, where economic extent is priority and the lack of independent supervision is the fact.
That evening’s courage and the sense of wisdom is not doubtful, but without fire as a powerful body, it is not a completely satisfying blood.
It is a fireless sacrifice sent without prejudice to the human creature of a disaster that could be destroyed.
Zhangs Mengfan doesn't work anymore in the firewall service, but visits the memory service in Tianjina.
He will not have a message about his losers in his heart.
I would most like to say to them: I've met your own and they've been.
Remember your ability in my mind.
Now I'm a member of you.
I'll fill you as a son at the right hand.
The green wheeler could affect the Score Roube sezon
Scotland's rubbish floor season will be started later, since the number of birds has been reduced in this year for the time.
More properties are lost because many of the new rubys have not survived in the most divorced conditions.
By marking the beginning of the season, the Association of Scotland Games Association (SGA) reports that Ruby calling provides more work than Edinburgh festivals.
OneKind, however, calls on the OneKind Protection Fund for the Protection of Protectors to terminate "brutal birds hiding".
The Director of the Organization, Harry Hjuton, said, "The thing that is involved for a large number of shoes for the protection of birds is great and unforbiddenly includes a whole-conflicted action."
There is no surprise that it turns away from this sport and calls the Government for an unnecessary, unnecessary job, which is only a small part of Scotland's people.
The owners of the country also claim that they are committed to maintain the number of birds and that rubbish floor is important for the economic development of the fields.
In the Presidency of the SGA, Alex Hogs said that the sector provides 8 800 full-term workshops in the regions in the year and that it is in the short-term "fair job" time.
He said, "In comparison with many European countries, the culture of the "meat" is not so involved in Scotland, and the part of the population does not know how the seasons affect the country economically."
Hogs said that the number of jobs guaranteed during the flood is over the number of workplaces that will be found together in the international festival of Edinburgh, the Friday Festival, the Tattoo Festival and the West West.
He added: "Occupation in Scotland is now totally disturbing, especially in the oil and gas sector, therefore players and their chairs want to promote the sector's inflation.
We want to work with the Government of Scotland to believe that hard workers can also trust in this workplace.
RSPB Scotia believes that the middle of the midst of the rubbish are killed at least eight gold bullets.
Many players recognize that rubbish breathing is not generally , but the SGA claims that the sector "and spread significant steps towards the best practice."
The day of the Ruben's breakfast season is traditionally known as "Single Twelve."
However, there are still a lot of discussions on this sport, and the management of rubbish bodies is the persecution of some criminals committed by natural protection bodies.
Thursday, RSPB Scotia said that in less than five years in Monadliath mountains, on the south-east of the Invernes, eight oil wounds have lost.
The Natural Protection Fund considers that they have been illegally killed in the nearby place of rubens and their satellite devices have been destroyed.
Mr. Rosanna Kaningema said that these reports are "inquired and confusing".
Ms. Kaningemas has given the officers to analyze evidence of about 90 survivors and died jerks with raids to determine whether there is a criminal activity trend.
The group of Scotland cleanses has the RSPB for the ́gene’s emotional feelings before the beginning of the Ruben's season, as well as indicated that there was no evidence that the birds had even been lost in Monadlith Mountains.
Rio Olimpic games 2016: Britain Peydge for British exciting trampline
British Representative of Peydja in the trampline
Brionia Paydge became the first British woman who was at the middle of the Olympics games in the trampline, and Rio was throwning a severe.

Derry City has moved to another Premierly, assuredly winning with a result of 5-0 battle with Finn Harps.
Aaron Makenefs made the "configation strips" leader, successfully performing two first half-time penalty situations which were granted for crimes against Luke Schubert.
Nathan Boils entered the gates at the beginning of the second half-time, and Shubert's overcome of the opposers at the fourth quartd before Kita Varda's desired advice, from the opposite to Finn Park.
Derry is for one point before Cork City, and both commands will be in the outdoor game in Brendivel last night.
It was the first deal of Derry over their northern west competitors hosezon, and they were traced to me at HARPS side.
Makenefs reached the games in 17 minutes after Kiran Cola's trip against Subert, although the crimes had been shown after the chastisement.
There were no doubts about the second penalty site, the former Barry Moloy's "Caramel's strip, to show Suber in Christ's country and Makenef at the 2-0 third minute after interruption.

Shubert seized the bomb low Colam before the 83th minute, and soon Varda's gudra followed the protector of the Harps Centre, Richard Brass.
It was Derry's greatest attraction in the series and great preparation from the famous game with Cork.
Testing on massive unusual tests at the University of High Steel and Islands (UHI) course
The course of 20 students could be an exhaustive invernes' college of UHI's highest media currency in the test.
Most of them were a 17 - 18 - year - old students who hoped to use the comments received in the study to be at the university.
The Inverne College UHI claims that quality protection processes are applied, adding that the Scotland Qualification Authority (SQA) investigates this case.
The SQA press secret said that the highest media extension of 2016 is "notified as possible".
Invernes' college’s UHI's offered and conducted courses have been reported to twenty students.
Many students were in the area of rural youths who had been involved in learning, but often had to join the colleagues of Invernes from their own places, such as Locheibers.
One student father said that after his daughter's publications, the social media about that she did not receive any extent of his work, at least 10 also arrived in the claim with a notice that they had not received any provision on his course.
He said to BBC News Scotland, that there were about five people who were in the college of Invernes in the past year, and who had come to communicate with them, said that it had happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter can't provide a place at the University of Glasgova, but she'll be able to accept other university offers thanks to the school employment.
However, her father said that there were also others who visited the colleague organize the media course which were not conducted and who were now "in reality" and who were in anxiety of whether their course would be revised and set up with a note to be able to enter into universities.
Invernes College UHI is a part of the University of High and Islands.
Diana Rovlinsone, college of Invernesa, UHI leader and executive director said, "The results of the tests and the students are important."
It also shows a large report of the Inspection of Education (HMIE) received today, as well as the levels of achievements improved in both further education and higher education in comparison with the past year.
As each year, we have made a public report, comparing them to the students predicted.
In the case of this specific course, standard quality protection measures have been taken, and the institution has recently reported "butic improvements in the provision and management of this provision" and "valuations were in accordance with national standards".
SQA is currently investigating this matter on our request.
The SQA press secret said, "It is glad that the highest media has been seen as planned in 2016 and that candidates had the opportunity to parse their understanding of the object."
Many candidates have shown good snow and have been seen a little by the A-C achievement indicator, compared to the same performance in the past year.
This was developed with previous documents and examples, and with specifications of our course and ability.
Brothers involved in prison for the "asinspirts" teeth in Kilmarno
Jason Braidnam was attacked by the Samurai teeth, the Nazi, and the boyfriend
Two brothers prisoned in prison for the killing of a man with a Samurai teeth after drug drugs in Airshire, which is investigated in "asinspirity".
The offer of Jason Braiden (38) was several times charged in Kilmarno in Kilmarno on 5 July 2015.
At the High Court of Glasgow, James Klâqa (36) will be consulted at least 22 years of prison after the sentence of a claim.
His brother John (38) was charged by a prisoner for 10 years after the sentence of a less severe accusation of disgrace without prejudice.
By joining both men in prison, Judge Bill Danlops Brother said that they had committed a "injured, disgraceful and disgusting attack".
He refused any adoption that Mr. Braidin was stuck and waited for them, armed with the Samurai teeth.
The Court Danlops added, "You are planning a illegal entrance together with at least one nazis and cottons."
Jason Braiden was also a narcodiller, but he was a son, a father, and a friend.
You killed him.
After both men in prison, a criminal police inspector who led the investigation said, "John and James Kl'k have been a violent and terrible action to the death of Jason Braidan."
In 38 years of age, in such a tremendous situation is a cardiovascular plastic condition that must survive.
The Court before heard that the brothers from Kilmarnok decided to cover the gold of Mr. Braidin, which they had brought to him in exchange for drugs.
Both of alcohol and drugs were given to his home, whispered faces with lands and armed with nazis and east battles.
It is considered that the dead teeth used in the cockpit belonged to the dead.
The neighbors said that we had Kl'hook's clothes, when he sat on the d'an at the window, and heard his crying.
The prosecutor Richard Godard said at the court's seat, "The man was endured, haotic."
After that, the location of the cluster was described as "asinspirt".
Additional evacuations from the neck gate of Braiden’s attack had a strong tragedy with a little object.
Three days later, he died in the Kilmarnok Croshaus Chamber.
Both brothers don't know.
By providing evidence, J. Kl.k., who has already been judged 38 times before, including the gender of disturbance, said, "I didn't want it. It was a bad case."
John Kl's, who has already been judged 23 times before, said he just went in to help the brother who, after he said, was arrested by Braiden."
Truely convinced by a prisoner about the decreasing and killing of his older son
David Sinclairs admitted his fault in his household in 2012.
A man who killed and killed the wrath of the children of his old age, because he didn’t want to eat, was advised by a seven - year - old and three - year - old prison.
David Sinclair krapped four old Joshua reports when "in time the control" was lost in his home in Eastkill Braid, South Lankashire, 6 December 2012.
The cause of the Nave was destroyed only after the medical expertise of the court.
Sinclair (34) was initially accused in the cluster, but was recognized as an offence in the middle without the preceding purpose.
In the High Court of Justice, advising him to a prison, judge Lord Breiseidl said to Sinclair, "You're attacking your older son to break them by creating an injury from which he died."
So, when you killed him, I was supposed to know that, but you didn't.
After basic medical studies, you recognize what you have done.
Your wife, Y, believed.
Now his feelings were delivered and can't support you anymore.
Lord Breiseidl described the consequences of Joshua's death as a "katastrophal" everyone and added, "Nothing will return to Joshua."
The first court was found that the day when the child died, Sinclair and his wife, Kerstia, had been joined with Joshua and purchased in the Great.
P. 17.30 Kerstia Sinklere had to contact mother and sister.
For 11 minutes later, Sinclair called to her, who heard "shooked".
He said to her, "Joshua doesn't feel like a man, he's just coming home."
Then he ended the conversation and called to 999.
The widow was immediately brought to the Church of Hermair, where he died.
In the beginning, Joseph’s death was not a cause, but he was considered by the command of the medical experts of the court, which found the results of the consequences of the traumatism before death, and such trauma were not possible to be disappointed.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richard, John Redklifa's advising neurochirurg in Oksford, said, "This is because the child has been cracked and thus has been guilty of opinions, as well as with greater than everyday."
The Representative of the Residence of Jans Djūgid said to the Court that Sinclairs was "freely deceived".
Rio Olimpic games 2016: Hloja Tatone threatened Julia Jefimova
Britain's representative Tatonai's hands go out of bronza in 200 m pellet
The British Representative Hloja Tatone criticizes the controversy of Julia Jefimova's share of Jeffimov will play Rio after the Russian representative will examine it in 200 m.
Jefimova, who was allowed to participate in games after the shared shared by the part of the country, was delayed by leaveing Tatoni on the fourth place.
"I'd like them to be completely clean games," then said the 20-year-old whale-bounder.
I haven't already determined who's parting there.
I'm not satisfied with it, but that's it.
Jephthah, who was in the second place, learned about his shared games only three days ago.
I don't want to imagine how people leave out of sport, but I don't think that it's right.
She did not have to participate in associations, and the 20 - year - old British representative had to have a medal.
Rie Kaneto highlighted Japan the seventh gold medals in 2016 in Rio's games, overcoming Jefimovu, who was at the middle.
China's representative Jinling This was at the bronze, just for a hundred seconds, considering the fourth one remaining Tatoni.
The British Commander, 20-year-old Molly Renšova, ended at the session.
"Stay at the fourth place is a little hope, just what is before you," added Tatone.
It's a great piece, and I'm a little whisky at the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and it'd be a dream.
However, the faith in the end is a great challenge that I will take with myself for the years.
It was a little hope, but for a long time it would make me powerful, and that makes me get more to be after meat, so I hope that I will ever get closer to it.
Tatone left only for 0.01 seconds from the British record of women 200 m in the finish.
"Every person must give another chance," - Jephimova.
Jephimoh, who said that he had already stopped answering questions about her ancient life, stopped his right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was fixed 16 reports after the foundation of anabolic steroide feet in her body.
The Sport Court (CAS) noted that sporters cannot be involved in the Rio games, because they have already applied sanctions before.
CAS looked at my ownness, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and someone else has a view, they can go to CAS," she said.
I'm not supporting it, and I'm never using it.
In the second case, it was not my fault.
Everyone needs another opportunity.
When you're good, and you're throwing down the penalty, no one's staying in prison.
Bens Prauds split places in 50 free style pelding

Your delegation is unfaithful and rup
Indian sport minister Vijajs Goels Rio Olympics games have been a completely rebellious person, often mented in tribines, encouraged Indian sportists and taking selfy after their starts.
However, he and his plane company have accommodated the wrath of Olimpiske games organizers because of their ungovernable conduct, rejecting to the consent zones without appropriate acreditations and reactions, being checked, the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Vijay Goels, photographed in July, justifys his conduct.
Thursday, the Olimpisko game organisations threatened to cancel the Goel Accreditation, if his conduct does not improve, sending a warning letter after he and his company were trying to enter a limited accommodation in the areas of vineyards and in the aren, where learning and speaking are happening.
"I have received a number of reports about that your Sport Ministry is a genius to enter the accreded consent zones with non-accredited persons," reported by the Continent Manager of the Organizators Committee of Rio 2016.
When the staff claimed that it was not allowed, the people with the minister became aggressive and ruptive, and sometimes wearing along our staff.
"If our protocol's command is known about any other cases of such conduct, your sport minister's acreditation will be canceled and its privilege of Olympical Games will be rejected," it was mentioned in the following letter.
The leader of the Indian delegation called this thing as "of the muscles of the wheat" and Goels himself said that he did not do anything wrong by writing it all as "intelligence".
In Tviter he wrote, "When I know, we have fulfilled all the rules.
We keep the spirit of Olimpisko games and support our Indian sportists.
Otherwise, even these Olympics games for India are totally divorced, for the time there is no med.
The losers of hope in social media showed that Michael Felps has treated so many medals - 26 as India in her history.
More prominent candidates have already been exposed, including the man Abhinav Bindra, who was in Pekina in 2008.
Now he left the fourth.
It has paid money and opportunity," the Sardinian writer and layer author of Shob De.
However, some hopes are still maintained, because there will be still in the box of accent, golf, tennis, lightletletic and, in the badminton.
The only Indian Vendor Dipa Karmakara will gather the final weekend, showing his fearful double turning "Nave Lecien", the product's leather, which only some other winners have generated.
The country in which 1,25 billion people live, the lower number of medals in India has always been the cause of complication.
Analytics say that it's an unseen reason.
National impairment is a cricket that is not a ambiguous sports type.
India is not fundamentally invested in infrastructure and empire training - the first victory tool of Karmakar was based on the older reserve d'.
Parents have always highlighted the academic knowledge over sports.
And the sports responsible authorities are taken with corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has abandoned the Indian Olimpic Association on its statutes in 2012, since it has been chosen leaders against whom the crimes have been proposed.
In sochas, three Olimpiski players of the North India have even been able to represent their country, to carry war or to wall any of the national symbols.
They are counted as independent sports.

The drug control Agency (DEA) has long opportunity for medical marihuana
Unfortunately, the answer is: we believe a little.
This is a lossing possibility that may be more deceased for the treatment of the doctor in the human beings.
Even today, only one federal level has been approved for scientific purposes for the use of the medical marihuana at the University of Mississipi.
In the most positive cases today, the DEA also announced that it would now allow other places to ask for authorisation to do the same.
Constant hope that marihuana environments and diversity could be extended for scientific purposes.
In addition, it will also be symbolic, in the meaning of the advantage of the benefit, because it will be symbolic, regardless of how many marihuanas are available, if access is disturbed, it is not a great importance.
Think of the product that is low, but is stored behind the door.
Reacting to the request for goods, who takes a difficult decision to make it more, but it will never have a door.
This product is marihuana, and it is found in the list 1 of the doors behind.
In such an inappropriate situation seems to be medical marihuana.
Since marihuana is a substance included in the list 1 (respectively, after definition it is "not approved for medical use now, and a high potential for its unused purposes"), it remains essential for the opening of the doors.
Potential researchers usually vispirm binding DEA, as it is authorised to start scientific conditions.
Even if a authorisation is issued for the study of the substances in the list 1, the authorities shall consider a strong safety rules and establish high level safety systems which may be digs.
It also remains the most important consideration of the entity of the receipt of authorisation from their academic authorities to make the provisions of the substances in the list 1 first.
Even if the representatives of the faculty want to make this issue, the university manager may not want problems or any potential of failing from the results due to press reports.
This occurred at the University of the University when Dr. Shu Sislia was released from the office after it had been able to go to the medical exhibitions of the marihuana.
Sislia finally came to search for private funding for its project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project proposal, its project became the first approved medical marihuana exhibition of the DEA.
Thus, after years, a long fight against birocratic shoes has been established by the National Institute of Response for Drugs.
It is currently the largest federal marihuana research in the financing country, and it is the only marihuana to make.
Even if there is a greater number of medical medicines in free circulation, the institution will have to approve all its financed assets.
The problem, however, is the name in which it is "abusing evil".
The representative of the San Francisco University Dr. Donalds Eubram, who interviewed his documental film "Marihuana", says that the institution's main assignment is to carry out substances in the context of their potential dependence, not as medicals.
Ebrahim is focused on a good fact.
Even if the dishes will overcome all the above, the doors may still be ≥ if the purpose is to benefit from the medical marihuana, not the damage of it.
Consider: In the US National Medicine Library, 1 434 works were found for medical marihuana during the last five years.
Only 57 works in the same search were benefits from the medical marihuana.
Most of the situations were about the damage of marihuana, such as "Good trip due to marihuana anticholinergic effects", "Marihuana's broadcast pancreatitis" and "Marihuana's use and the risk of pulmonary cancer".
Such disproportion creates a completely exhausted blood.
The path to the use of the medical marihuana has been interrupted with surprises and illness, where a look is.
While the DEA is able to hold the status of list 1 without regard to medical effects, the United States Department of Health and Social Affairs maintains a wide range of Canabis patents for medical purposes.
The DEA continues to establish marihuana-like heroin and LSD as drugs with high dependency potential, even though the DEA's main administration of the rights was contrary to it.
Strict medical meaning of marihuana is more powerful than many broadly consumed foods.
For example, 10 fresh cartridges may cause toxic reactions.
Consequently, it is impossible to feed so many marihuanas to put death.
Marihuana in its natural form is one of the most therapeutic substances known for humans.
In rational analysis, marihuana can be used in the doctor according to monitoring.
It must be said again that the judge of the DEA proposed it.
Yet, after 30 years, it has changed.
If we know it or not, we all accept a known doses on our daily basis.
We may not always have energy to express it sounds or we are so low or disappointed that no one, you know, has not seen it.
As regards the claim in the context of the Federal Medical Marihuana Policy, it must be sustainable to present the facts without prejudice.
For example, Charlottes Fidji, whose reliefs are reduced by medical marihuana, and many other parts are dependent on it.
It is the value of speaking at higher level that the plant can benefit so much and to stay behind the doors.
Bloody Beetroots: Donalds Tramps "Blondais Berluskoni"
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of the electronic music
Musicians say Tramps dominates the media like Berlusconi
You know, we have gone to Berlusconi in Italy, and Tramps looks like a blond Berlusconi," the "The Bloody Beetroots" elektronic music pank unit said CNN.
The candidate of the President of the Republic and the magnitude of the Italian media as a politician, both knowing their overwhelmed persons, accepting press attention and changed stories for the media.
"Bloody Beetroots" in the station Rifo is known with its electronic dech music and has cooperated with various artists, starting with the legend of Seru Polu Makartney and finally with the song of the electropop Grett Svabo Beču in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love".
Rifo was born in the city of Italy Basano del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, which is about to cover the time of pancrocs, and the numbers "1977" are recorded for music on a cross.
"The English is not my birth language, so I don't understand everything about your world," said Rifo, hiding behind the black, which he's known.
I'm trying to investigate, and I'm trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited the people to see the "Videocracy", a documental film, which is a Berlusconi monopol on the Italian media.
The documentary movie is how "Berluskoni made the Italian trac", said Rifo, added that Trampa has a similar impact on America.
"You're how a man can completely explode the system and split everything... by your own," he said.
I think Tramp's not good in this country.
Two Turkish mariners captured in prison in more than 500 million stars in the case of marine drugs
Two Turkish men have been judged by a cocaine countband of more than 500 million stars in the North Sea, each in prison for at least 20 years.
Mamin Sahins and Emins Ozmens were recognised as guilty of the court in the High Court of Glasgow after about 100 Jews from the Bardinas' borders to "MV Hamal" were found three tonnes of class A drugs.
The residence in 2015 is the largest of the cocaine cocaine market that has ever been arrested in the sea in Europe.
Mom Sahinam and Emina Ozmen have been consulted for his role in a great drug transaction
The goods of drugs found on the ship are one of the largest British stories
Narcotics were hidden in particular in the hidden hidden in the registered ship in Tanzania, which was shiped from Stambula to Tenerifi and then to the North Sea.
It stopped the British flotes fragate "HMS Somerset" and the HMC Valiant frontier.
Sahin (47) was judged for 22 years, but Ozmens (51) in the High Court of Glasgow is judged for 20 years.
The judge Lord Kinkleiven said to men that many drugs were "not only important but worthwhile", and the drug counterband is a "severe impact" on humans and surrounding relationships.
He said, "You were income commercially in the most important operation, including the transport of cocaine with ships, the operation that covered international and true intercontinental borders."
He said that Captain Sahins of the ship wasn't "alcootic cock", but he's having a significant role in the criminal crime, but the second role of Captain Ozmen was "which as less".
The inspectors insisted on "Hamal" after introducing information from the French customs authority's DNARED, and when it arrived in Aberden, they went through the treeboard, accessing the hidden section, where 128 streets with cocaine weight of 3,2 tonnes were found, as the approximate value in the black market is 512 million strelines.
MV Hamal checked the king's football last year.
There were three tonnes of cocaine on the ship.
Checking the ships has been detected that it has been translated to tons of class A drugs.
The ship was traveling from the Bosfora sea south to South America before it was arrested in the North Sea.
The access to this place was restored under the ship in one of the office rooms, and the spring was decemented.
Sahin and Ozmens were recognised as an offensive transport of cocaine and hidden in the ship in the past 20 February to 23 April, and as cocaine at the duration of 21 April to 23 April.
Both recent men who worked in the ship since school ends continue to claim that they were not guilty, yet accepted the speed.
The complaints against four other men are missing evidence.
The lawyer of Sahina, John Krow, said that the father of two children was a glorifying mood.
He said, "A man who was incoming to carry out drugs."
Someone who's able to get a ship.
In view of drug hierarchy, Sahins is certainly not at the end of drugs, but somewhere below.
The mild cocaine many aspects on the ship means that it had to be moved with a roadcrane
Police went through all ships for days before drugs were divided by these boxes
In February 2015, the Court listened to the questions of his Captain's work at "Hamal" in Sahina.
Mr Krova said that it was "shooted" about the need for a long time of important daughters (9) and son (13) events and "only want to return to Turkey".
Both men haven't committed their own since the prison in April 2015, since they are still fighting to get the visa.
Ozmen's lawyer Di Murs said he wanted "excusable" to support his family, but he knows that it's not possible in the transparency.
After this day, the Swedish prosecutor David Hâvius said, "The international drug trade has no limit, and we, whose engagement is to break it, work more closer together to put us in front of one step.
"Scotching in the persecution of criminals is actually a global level, and in this case we have made economic losses to the representatives of organized crimes."
Narcotics were found in the ship, including under the ships.
The inspectors of this contraband package found hidden vessel room
Mr Højvija added: "Hamal" was identified after explanation information from the French authorities and after cooperation with Tanzania, where the ship is registered, a general prosecutor who also passed to the ship.
"Our investigation was then provided from Gian, which provided significant data on Property, until Spain, which gave us ≥ valuable information on the ships in Canadian Islands.
We also cooperated with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to join specific evidence elements.
Despite the basic explanation of the fact that with Hamal, a large number of drugs is devoted, the representatives of the British authorities in international waters could never have been able without the authorisation of the Tanzania Government - even as they never had ever been at home.
Seu Peitena, the Procuratory of the International Justice and Organizated Crime Procurement (CPS) of the Royal Crime, said: "After and accurately, the CPS criminal rights advised to receive the authorisation of the authorities of Tanzania for 24 hours from the receipt of information on the ship.
In accordance with international maritime rights, the British officers have no right to make it in international waters to a ship under the fight of another country, unless this country does not issue a specific legal authorisation to do so.
Without our acts of criminal rights, we would have a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never call these people to the responsibility.

Lanka pure dad's out of the child's school for T-crocling with a lack of name
The father of two kids will be from the child's school about the arrival of their sports day T-cree with a protective record.
Craig Makbet (36) from the Birnly City in Lankashire says that he was "new" to be put in a crown with the letter "Light and Dr.
However, despite the fact that when he saw his mission and the second T-croc, on the day he found that he had been able to enter into the school territory.
The only father who worked for four years for the starting school leader of Park in Colne, Birnly, was unable to go back, and the staff even called for social services and police.
Kreig Makbets (36) from the Children says that he was not released in the school territory after the day of children's sports had come to the protection of T-cree.
Mr Birnli's accusation of the school director S's Midgeli's response to excessive axes.
He says he's not seen his minds about that before he comes to look at his two children's accuracy, he's wrong after the throwing T-croc.
The father, who doesn't work for the leader of the school, said, "There was a mistake and an ignorance from my side."
I didn't think about the day and steps of sport when I was on it.
At the closer end of the action we had a father's consensus, and the director observed my T circle and said that it was not appropriate.
I forgived and returned to the other side, and the thing also ended.
However, 36 years old man said that he had received a letter from the President of the school leaders on the day he was invited to meet the director, but he did not see the need to do it because he had already been excused.
"Therefore the school director called me and said I've been able to enter the school territory," added Mr. Bernley.
I learned that after the day of sport, some of the Facebook sites had been pronounced about their attitude and that many people were interested in it.
Any reasonable person says that it is overwhelmed.
Mr McBeth, who is the Love Mini editor of the website, said that he was not even able to return back to the last day of the semester.
However, it was for a reason to call from school and social services.
On the T cross was the father of Kreiga ČÍLZA Listers from the BBC Cultural Cultural Committee "Red ectochis" with one of his iconic expressions "Light and Dr.
He commented, "I told them that I wasn't there, because I've been back to school.
Then he invited me from social services and asked why I was not a girl.
The school also called the police because I didn't come after the girl for about 40 minutes."
Mr Macbeth stated that he was told that he could no longer go into school rooms and that he would be in force until the next notification.
He also mentioned that it was warned that he could apply the 500 sterline penalty money if it was determined to violate these rules.
Midgelia, director of the park's initial school, said that this thing is now finished.
Midgelia, Director of the Initial School of Park, said, "I'm supposed to confirm that Mr. Macbeta has been declined from the office and that there is no more in our school leadership."
This thing is now finished, and I hope to return to school in September."
The Children's adviser Joe Cuney said that school is a policy and guide.
"We must keep everyone in mind that by taking the ambassador as a counselor or leader, on July, the higher standards are concerned, and, despite this time, he did not follow these standards," he said.
John Nickson’s adviser added that it was unbelieving that the school had to apply to him and that the muscle had been exhausted.
Mr. Nikson added, "The carrying of this T-crew was a mock, and he also forgave it."
The Lankashire police said they were calling from school, but they didn't come.
In the last time, there have been renewals of the VEF-shops, which seem to be on the street of the Branch, - there a few IT companies, the sector of this area has already started to be a Silicio-site.
The other VEF territory is also developed, including Berzaunes.

Justice: The Democracy on the obligation of healthcare model with additional financial burden for citizens does not have any criticism.
Any demagogy on the obligation of health care that would have been made to the people of payment and increasing, does not have any critical effect, considers the jurisprudence of Juris Janson.
Janson is today with the health minister Andu Chaxh to discuss the health sector.
After the meeting, Jansons journalists said that the model for the financing of the sector is a sustainable and developed health system, which would make it available to patients.
He also noted that in this case, it should be discussed about additional funding for healthcare, since it is currently inadequate.
Jansons also stressed that any demagogy on obliged health care, which would cause the population to be paid and increased, does not have any criticism, especially if the model of the Netherlands is called.
Janson said that the Netherlands' health rejects 11% of the internal common product while Latvia is only 3%.
The Government and Parliament should therefore have sufficient responsibilities to ensure that it is necessary to be moved from this area, providing justice and adding that the model offered by the Ministry of Health (VM) will not work in other cases.
Chuckha thanked the jury for the support and showed that the main concern is that the patient should come to a doctor, which at the same time means that the health environmental system needs additional financing.
The Minister also showed that 35 million euros will only be possible with the planned additional in order to make the most accurate cases in respect of the on-closical patients and the special debt.
The VM has also developed a plan and has made a request for additional awards of 41 million euros to healthcare in order to reduce lines to professionals and research.
"A question of priorities, whether it will be the means or not," she said.
This amount does not include a payment to the doctors.
Recalling that the doctors were not suspicious of the overall three variants of the health financing model in the Government, including that which provides additional payments to patients, Chuckha said that through all three models, the Government was given the opportunity to develop.
Janson also added that through all three models, it is possible that Latvia is not a additional burden for the population.
It has already been reported that the VM will stop the variance of the health financing model which does not regulate the common burden, but requires a part of the social tax to the health, stated in the context of the conceptual report "For the exchange of the Latvian health system of financing model".
At the same time, the Ministry shows that the best option for health financing will be selected at the outcome of the debate until the end of September.
The local arbuses are already part.
Along with this year, Grobny's news is recognized by the Roland Dambis, Roland.
Arbuzi has already been spent on the League market.
In the production of a number of first rubbers, but we wanted the bombs to be lost, the regional time of Kurs' Time.
"This year arbuzi grows better than last year," the story of a big egg in the Rucava newspaper Artis Ques.
In the meantime, this was much more favorable in the morning than in the past when it was wind and wind.
It's starting the theater theater Riga.
In the 12th and 13th August, the Teater of Parles will visit the Teater of Liepha, by offering to the viewers both the "Playing night" for the shows mentioned for the "Playing Night" and the strong intrigus - the League Teater Director Herberta Laukstein, the Portal "Delfi" reports the teater representatives.
On 12 August, the viewers will be shown by the "Zillongman" human dream, who was studied by Laura Groza-Kiber.
This is a story of a real historical person - John Meriku - who called the Victorian Times in London and his body, because of the deformed body of deformation, was called for Zilon Human.
In the study, Egon Dombrovski, who received the name "Gada Holder" for Merika's role.
As the criticist Normunds Acets characterized his activities, Merik is a "procured heart" role where the birther is not renewed.
On 13 August, the "Portreti" pressure was offered to the viewers.
The appearance received six "Playing night" nominations, including "Green Form Exposition".
The register was designed as a self-natural portrait galery, equally the importance of granting to each bullet, until each of them is both a centre and a background.
The demonstration consists of a number of mini mini-experiences covered by the United States in a single health.
It is a question of human nature, where the main conflict is between true emotions and an exciting calculation, as a person changes in different situations - each of the powerful times is a village that is a deep-speededed, sometimes the eggs, which sometimes disappointed by poverty and its benefits.
At the same time, in both these days, the Small Hall will be played by the Director of the Teater Herbert Laukstein "Man who is more than lift" in the Galynn Polyguk mode.
It is not to be sorrowful, but humor is a full story of how a single person becomes a lift.
Despite the capsite stylistics dominating the show in the visual box, the intonation of the dominant intonation is still light and even optimistic.
"A man who is more than lift" is not a decision of unity and age, but of the value of love.
Also, if it doesn't seem to be what," the criticist Līga Ulberte is in writing.
Biletes for all in the study are possible to enter the "Bible Paradise" boxes and on the Internet.
Detect Olga: My work is not serious, but real.
I'm already waiting for Olga Zelicka, the owner of the Riga Detect Agency, and investigator.
He's laughing and leave the incidence of a person's position.
Turn in the white bikes and in the white jacket - a elegant woman who takes all my ideas about what a woman should-detect.
She's waiting for me with the shoes from which I'll be able to answer.
I would say that I talked to her because I was interesting that a woman worked with such an unusual thing.
It's always a work of men.
Olgai is the highest legal education - the magic grass.
At the same time, it works in the criminal police.
You realized that they wanted something to do with their own and designed their company.
Knowing is the fifth.
"I didn't want to go back in the police," Olga says.
It's a routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated things and received information.
We'll be able to handle those holding.
"Today, for the 10-year-old "Riga Detect Agency".
She calls for the jubilee's swimming, "It's not gonna be drinking."
All are soldiers.
A question about her business, Olga says, "Bizness is special."
I had a command for the first five years.
Then I realized that sometimes it is dangerous to work in the command.
This is a business when, if any non-professionally works, it can be reached in the bad situation.
If journalists have the fifth power, we're other.
Sfera, of course, isn't simple.
Many of us are going to drink because we are working with the learning of ours.
People already think that!
Many people ask whether to place listening devices at dogs.
Many have seen films.
Detect business is serious.
"This is the collection of information," says Olga.
If a crime occurs after the law, I need to warn about it.
The wallets are green and laughing - to be at least a cheese to which the negotiations will be held and caused.
I've got a customer whose husband's staying.
She looked for protection, of course.
M's also insurance.
Her husband was a man.
At the beginning, everything is always nice and nice, but then it starts.
"It's the same most terrible," Olga says.
Psihe's insulted, and it's happening that you can stand like a boat.
It could be wrong.
Do not give God with selfishness.
This is dangerous.
People become victims at a moment.
"Many women want to go out of the family and then return," she says.
I refused from the last sentence.
"It was the first time in my position," said Olga.
There was such a d'actual location.
The woman was wondering, she had a son.
"He's the son of her husband and made her an invalite," Olga recalls.
I think the woman has a mother-instinct, and, firstly, it needs to protect herself.
When all that happened, she came to me with the ability to come from her husband v.
There are people who are seated with an appeal.
The most terrible is that your mother turns the eyes on it.
I couldn't understand it.
Her child is now invasive.
We couldn't find a lock once, and the dog helped.
Narcotic node is generally impossible without dogs.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are no healthy dogs," she says.
Of course, the facts of learning are currently.
Or in the family there is an emergency and the information needs to be provided.
It's just killed that's the guilty.
The last thing I'm talking about the team when the engines have rejected others.
It's interesting, because sometimes men's fashion, now are women.
Even the best friends fight!
Women's spent for 100 and more thousand euros.
Women need to be cared by getting to the land because they can sell them in slavery.
"The Latvian women are intellectual and too reliable," Olga believes.
There were cases when couples come to the land to appreciate the second time.
It's not legal.
Olga says that she had a man like Jesus Christ.
Gara's, the mother's width.
When I was 22, the tragedy occurred.
He had a severe head tragedy.
He returned as a completely different man.
"I'm getting him out," remembers Olga.
It can be compared to the elli, it was terrible.
A question of what is the most usual thing you're talking about, Olga says, "All are special, but it's in the mirror the thing that uses the faithfulness."
When it's taken.
Receives and don't give money.
If you have a jurist education and you're in the police, you can work as a detective.
"There's a thing to be like a detective, the other--be it," says Olga.
The situations in which we resolve unbelieving matters are mostly trapped because women often do not even have a solution to resolve.
They are not able to accept the result.
It is an invisible location, because a man is not able to lose a family.
Not every woman is accepting reality.
Often only young girls who feel money are using rich men.
One man who kissed his wife said that it could not be that she wasn't lovers of her, because all her wives were cut off.
"He's been triggered three times," Olga remembers.
At that time, there's a man's problem if all wives are at him.
Olga says about the case when a man left a woman with all the laws, and she asked him if he had ever been on his hand.
I've always answered him.
In such cases, I will refuse to work.
I'm interesting in how things are resolved - or are taken to photographs and shown, if there are evidence of learning.
How's that happening?
"Parliamentary detectives have the protection of personal data," says Olga.
This is to cause a question.
One allows it to do everything, and the second - it doesn't allow anything.
Personal interests we can take such photographs and videos, but you're looking at no.
If the court submits a material that does not comply with the law, there may be great problems.
It must also be mentally healthy and satisfy the criteria to become a detective, not enough for education and training.
We're not taking the purchases of the offices, and the police works with it.
I tell the clients - get out of the series, here's real!
In fact, when I worked in the police system, they also came to use dogs, they helped.
"Narcotic node" can't happen without dogs, " Olga's story.
Some clients with me are hanging on the survey of coolness, but I don't like to take such things.
They're hard things.
Now there are still more clients, because women are guilty of men.
Sometimes it was different.
Now the women are divorced, but men are sitting at home with a house.
"Of course, most hard people," said Olga.
I like Deils in Karnegi.
He's saying, stop arresting and saving really.
We all know the paroon that if you're in one bowl, you must turn the second, but it's not possible!
You need to say that you're incompatible.
It doesn't be done.
You can't be afraid to lose what's in it!
You can't become a littlehist, there's what we allow to do with us.
My first thing was with a man’s unbelieving man when a woman did not accept the fact that the husband was his husband.
She always called and asked what to do with her.
"I now ask all clients if she's able to accept a position when she's learning that a man's up to her," says Olga.
It's not an explanation, it's the.
If you come and detect something, you need to take your responsibility.
It's not a teater, soft, but real.
I'm sometimes a specialist.
It's a heart thing and with Japanese medicine - treatment with hands.
It's an interesting thing.
Why did I start working with that?
It's a large quantity of adrenalin, and it's needed to be disturbed.
You need not just dead, but renew energy, light.
"The people go out of my office's position and satisfy," Olga says.
She has had a number of signs in the wall office, and Olga says that it is written not with the otte, but with the purchasers.
I didn't just get to that, but the book for a few hours in my hands.
I'm getting it as a sign.
However, it is personal.
You know more than a few times here.
Olga also sing.
That's her v.
We're all in trouble.
From 11 years, I played a gitarr.
I've entered the songs and clips.
I'm a position and a smile, but I need to be repeated.
Others rescue alcohol, me - rays.
Alcohol's gone.
The police uses it much because the work is full of stress.
"There is an aggression, and the guys can be unpredictable," she says.
I'm interested in sports and races.
I worked with tennis for 15 years.
I'd like to go with the kids again.
I would like to write the book in nature, the articles.
The detector's work is a small limit when the work comes into your position.
"This is a job that shouldn't be left in," she says.
A question of how you can join the work with the privacy, Olga says, "My loved man seems in Italy."
M. has powerful feelings.
At that time, there is the most real love in my place.
I have enough to advise him, and I'm feeling better.
The detection is usually unbelievable, but he has taken my job.
In fact, I share a job from the privacy.
I haven't come to this business as well.
I've been incredible.
When I was a child, I had more than others.
Thank you sometimes, the intuition is open.
Detect's a lot but actually working - a little.
In any way, it's a work with smileys, and it's hard to get back.
You also need a repair.
"And you can't renew," Olga admits.
The greatest case I'm working is the story of Constanti.
A year of training at its cases.
The man was born for his wife.
I did that, though, that the baby with my mother went to England - more than the threats.
There was no other variant.
We shouldn't blame ourselves.
Measured compassion.
It cannot be done.
We need to rejoice for every day we have.
Thank God.
Each day, three good things should be told each other.
A good worker or a day must be carried out.
We don't have to do that with men.
It's a big error.
We know that we have a man, not a child, and we need him to care about us.
If not, return and go away.
You can go to the church, I've helped it.
You don't have to be a fanate, but to do what you like and help.
Nothing will change if it doesn't change, it must go out and change its compliance.
In any case, you should not be threatened by yourself and your bear.
You don't have to sit down and get something light.
Humans are good to do good and support each other.
If God has created us, we are already needed and we are not in the world.
You can never sit on the place!
How better to prepare for photosesi.
The Vasara is still in full space, as well as soon as a regular year of training that is trained in photo memories.
In the pictures of all looked happy and beautiful, it is valuable to advise how to prepare the photosession before.
The advice "Ihappyama" provides a multi-children mother Aleksandra Nesterenko and a professional photograph of Marina Levickai.
In nature of photography, it is much more natural and more harmonised.
It is much more difficult to be influenced and lost.
It is recommended to select a single style of clothing in the same range.
For example, Alexandra reports that she chooses clothing to all six members in order that clothes be not more than three tones and may be less written on clothing.
Don't be deemed to be a good decline.
Repeat, worry, play, but in any case don't cry and do it, if the case is not as obedient as possible.
And, look, the next advice is already sounding from the staff of professional photography!
You must understand what you want to eat during the photosession and tell them about the photograph.
One of them will be beautiful, accurate and ideally designed images, others - "z ́e is what it is," mean, wanting to replace true, true emotions, or, how to love the same photographs, - "refugious mugurs", "beauty eye", "search degungal".
Of course, somebody wants "to two in one" but it's going to happen straight.
In any case, when you go to the photosession, you need to understand that they're just a few hours from your own, and at least you'll be awesome as well.
You are yourself - not even a strong mother who works, eat, eat, egg and it, and not a forever taken dad who speaks in the telephone.
And not the man who lives behind some unknown clothes.
Remember how great it is to discuss one another, carefully and carefully.
And then, the photograph update will only be aware of real mysteries that rule between you.
If you chose a photograph, trust him.
Stay 250 times in the park of the meeting, listen to his advice clothing in the choice, place for the best frames.
Take all n's clothes before, so that the photosession day should not work with it anymore.
Expand the route and advice on how long you will need to reach the session (in particular if photographing occurs in the study and time is limited).
If you're small, then choose the photosesi time that matches the date of advancement so that it does not happen when a little guy usually goes a dinner.
And, of course, it is not necessary to take with them food, captures, waters and favorite oil use only in extreme conditions.
Dad said that he might have to get out of the rocks, but that is not already written in the advice, and only photographs know what it is, the Marina recognises.
Do not eat many waters before the photosession and before it.
And it would also be recommended after photosession to make everyone an exhibition.
Call to the tract park, feed a wedding, visit the sticks - which is more likely.
So you will at the same time gain great images and pleasant memories of the day together.
Crossophorow and Fadejeva: Minimum ships - a widespread or bremse for peoples?
Minimum dealing issues with discussions have a status of happiness or sanctuary govs: whether to support the establishment or to mention any unexpected, general phrase.
In view of the risk of stagnation, we have been able to avoid technical recession, we think it is important to consider that the creation of minimises is no wonder that reduces the inequality of income with one house, the nearby Latvia's almost western Europe and the completion of the national budget.
On the other hand, if the minimum deal is a lot, it makes more damage than benefits, since its creation reduces competitiveness and employment, particularly in sectors and areas with low income.
In the first point, it is not so high that, despite a number of minimum increasing in the following crisis period, the minimum obligation in Latvia is not so high that the establishment of the competitiveness of companies for some tenths in the year - only EUR 370 until the minimum obligation in some EU countries is about half thousand.
However, it is an offence if it is compared to the average country (%) - a minimum rate in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average indicator.
Since the specificity of the minimum alga is significantly higher than the neighborhood countries in Latvia (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Iceland - 6%[1]), the same minimum rate of the rate of the minimum rate of the company is committed to the majority of the company.
The results of each fifth Latvian undertaking with the Company of Latvian Bank replied that it was important or important to increase the prices of the product at the beginning of 2014.
This means that, for the first time, the minimum degree of consumers were partly financed (i.e. Latvia's population); secondly, the concurrence of prices for several enterprises means competitiveness in both the internal market and the countries (i.e., contributed to imports and reduced exports).
For the weak competitiveness and cost production volumes, each fifty-five Latvian enterprise was important to leave ́s (which means greater unemployment and immigration).
Furthermore, each eleventh enterprise replied that it was important to restrict the adoption of the new employees in the work.
Remember that in 2011-2013, the minimum alga has not changed in Latvia.
Thus, even if, in the evaluation of the layout of 2014, each fifth undertaking as a significant improvement of productivity, it does not yet mean that the same result could be expected in 2017 too (the fourth minimum delaying of the productivity could be reduced by order).
Other important results are - because of the minimum debt steps, several enterprises were important to increase the payment of more than the minimum debt.
Thus, the minimum impact of the obligation was significant for even those undertakings where the minimum obligation was not accepted.
In the past years, the minimum degree of labour levels in all three Baltic countries exceeded the nominal productivity of work (real labour productivity + inflation).
Thus, the following resulting in the production phase of work, without the basis of the minimum increase in the rate of employment (including the total of the low rate of euro) will not affect the competitiveness and employment of the companies.
In evaluating the basicness of the layout of minimum rate, it is not only sufficient for the medium rate analysis of the medium rate.
It shall also be assessed whether the layout of minimis is "panese" in sectors and regions where the minimum obligation is most commonly used.
The results of the Latvia Bank's appropriation show that the largest concentration of the minimum algae is in small enterprises (number of 10 to 19; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the part of the service sectors and services was greater (16% and 19%) than trade (15%), building (11%) and financial and environmental sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latgali, where the minimum rate is 64% of the average debt (and more than two thirds from the average private sector), its next degree can be farer by reducing the employment requirement (i.e., maintaining its high unemployment) and promoting the economic sustainability of the enemy.
Some signs indicate that the minimum degrees of the late development in 2014-2015 have been broadcast.
For example, Latgale is the only Latvian region in which unemployment was higher than in 2013.
It notes that in Estonia and Lithuania there is no region that would be so dismissed in the meantime debt from the other countries.
For example, the average rate in all regions in Estonia is at least twice above the minimum rate set out in the country.
The lowest debt in Lithuania are in the Taurage region, but there was 54% of the average debt in 2015 (for two rare minimum debts in 2016 could have reached 58%).
The debates on the time of implementation are lacking economic reasons, and it is not implemented in no short-term or long-term.
Firstly, such a high number of the average duty or even so close to it is not in any EU country.
Secondly, it would mean to reduce the minimum rate over the average rate for several people's sectors (which would mean bankroot and mass release of these sectors), such as clothing, skin processing, fish transfer, food services and veterinary services, whereas it is more than the current middle ship in Latvian private sector.
The layout of minimum debt from January 2017 to EUR 400-410, as currently offered by the Ministry of Goodness, would make a minimum debt in Latvia (% of the average debt) for one of the highest EU.
If the nominal productivity is at least 4% but at least two times faster, it is obvious that the consequences of competitiveness and employment of the enterprises are uncertain.
Such negative consequences will be most diffused in the sectors and regions where the current minimum debt is already often used, such as Latvia.
The fact that a significant minimum degree of debt is currently not allowed means that other mechanisms should be used for the support of the beneficiaries of low wallets.
The immediate effect may be by traveling with the income tax of the citizens (in the budget optional limits).
Inadequate level of education, non-compliance with the educational area and the bad quality of education, as well as an uncomfortable health level (which often occurs, not due to medical services and low-level) is mentioned between the real causes of income inequality.
In the period, 521 Latvia's responses were obtained for the reaction to the minimum debt in January 2014.
The issue occurred in the draft project of the European Central Banking System for the Dynamic Network (Wage Dynamics Network).
These figures represent undertakings with a number of enterprises not less than 10.
This also decreases the low specificity of the low levels with minimum algaes in a manner.
On the following day, 11 fires registered in Latvia, showing that the State Service of Fire and Salvation (VUGD) is operating information.
The greatest fire flowers had risen from Ogres's news at Ogresgala, where 80 square meters in the area of the house that was not occupied in the Yellow Road Chamber, and in Jacabpil, where with a revoltate large bowl with a square of 30 square meters in the area.

LPF could be able to leave Mrs.
Latvia's Pelding Federation (LPF) could at the nearest time be able to take the leadership of the Federation Chairman Kasparu Poni, the Agency LETA told the former Vice-President of the Federation, Džen.
Dji said that, taking into account the criticism of Mrs and his activities in the Federation, several LPF have signed a letter to call the LPF collection, which is the highest Federation Institute, and it is right to decide any question raised at the assembly of the LPF.
The Federation is not satisfied with the style of Mrs Guide, where it comes to Riodejaneiro's empire games, where the Latvia's record was not able to come in Olimpiad, the goods of Alone's Ribakov's trainer to German Jakubovski, are considered as an irrelevant action of the Netherlands and the President.
Dyn showed that the LPF and the Federal Secret of the Avairs Platonows have achieved great work for the development of the Federation and Sports, but the Federation of Pones dev does not be appreciated.
The Djan, who worked for a long time in the Federation, said that in the Federation I had a genuine feeling to concentrate the powers in the hands of the people.
As well as their federality, it may also be able to carry out regulatory statutes of LPF operation which are in such a way.
Djis said that the uncomfortableness of Mrs Works Federation has been longer, but the last days' events have been made to the "the last pile" federality to make a decision to be made.
The former Federation Vice-President claimed that during Mrs's operation was decreased by the trends and judges' work.
Djin said that in order to ensure the derogation and decision-making processes in the Federation, LPF had decided on a meeting of authorisation to the Board, which was in the present position of Mr and two Vice-Presidents, the Federation.
However, as Dean admitted, Mr advocated the federality.
The Federation trusted Mrs, considering that in the Federation, it would be more able to make decisions.
"They're confidence, because they practically took the power in their hands, making a non-ethical step," said Džen.
"This attitude cannot be from persons who should be served as examples of other sports representatives," Dženis admits.
In Denna, Mr President's officer official gentlemen are to satisfy their ambitions, which, at the same time, do not honor him as the President of the LPF.
The long-term LPF General Secret Vladimirs Maslovski told the Leta Agency that the letter to the Federation could be submitted in the next week until the LPF meeting should be held during the report.
He thinks that there is "all the troubled issues" at the meeting and must be decided about the next action.
Mr. Friday has not yet been informed that LPF plans to call a assembly where it could be able to deal with its release from the office.
At the time, I don’t know anything about the meeting, so I don’t have a comment.
As regards the fact that I have been uncomfortable with my work, there has been only one case, with the already mentioned Leader Jakubovski, when there is a disappointment.
Before London's empire games, when Ribakova was not approved between participants, he was with acknowledged in the International Water Sport Federation (F). He invited Latvia to not send any sportist.
"Because this case, Jacobovski lost the trainer's office, because his action did not also refer to LPF interests," said Mr.
He also highlighted that the transfers have not been taken in the LPF meetings in which it was reported.
"Instead, we have accepted the appreciation that the quality of the work of the Federation is better," said the President of LPF.
Mr. also said that the Riodejaneiro's empire games had not been deployed but to work.
The parts of people in Latvia are no longer understanding of the functions of the Presidents of the Federation.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these areas and, for example, we do not receive wages from the leaders of the Latvian Olympics Committee (LOK).
At the same time, we need to be able to acquire the financing of the sports federation, since only 10% of the NPF from the country are obtained.
During Olimpic games, I have had formal and non-formal meetings with the representatives of international Federation and various international programmes, including with international sponsors.
"It is the same negotiations and I worked in order to take place one of the world's passports in 2018," said Mr.
As shown in the Portal "Firms.lv" data, LPF entries in 2015 were in total 249 444 euros, which are incomplete of 36 000 euros more than 2014.
Approximately 40% of this depth were designed for targeting, which, compared to 2014, was about EUR 10 000.
The LPF also received approximately 43% of the income or 109 442 euros in the form of the institution and other annual contributions.
In the form of transactions and gifts, the Federation of Pearn received 35 532 EUR.
The expenditure of the Pyrn Federation, compared to 2014, increased by approximately EUR 70 000, totally EUR 263 876 in 2015.
The largest expenditure was not payable with money to persons or material expenditures, nor to algaes - 215 733 euro reported as "Other expenditure".
The payment for persons was charged for EUR 20 549, but the payment was paid by EUR 14 684.
If the 2014 Federation had been concluded with a positive balance, the LPF in 2015 would be from a negative balance.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) requested the Latvian Olimpic Committee (LOK) on the share of the President LPF in the Riodejaneiro Epic Games, which, at the time, had not been rejected by the Latvia Trainer of Ribakovski.

Arture is artificially transferred to the weightest category to enter into the empire command.
The green category has already been taken up to 100 kilograms, therefore Arthur used the European quotas in the severe weight category.
Arthur with 100 kilograms weight was fighting against a murderer with 140 kilograms and who has already been severely winning in a serious tourist.
In the most weight category, there is a few moments of disturbance.
If a simple weight category of years has always been seen, then in a weight - Property.
To question whether Nikiforenko would be better fighting one step in the easier weight category, Baskin answered confirming.
I think - Artura should be better fighting in category up to 100 kilograms.
It is its actual weight category.
He's not a real weight.
65% of the Venezuelans want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are fighting for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to leave President Nikolaso Maduro, but the question is whether they are fighting for it.
On the day after the National Willing Board announced that "no time" has been required to revoke the vote, which Chavismo will be at the powers to 2019, the people continued the time of their present days as if nothing would happen.
"I didn't hear the news because I looked at Olympics games and how Michael Felps gained two more med," said Rafael Dean, a 36-year-old officer, who was on the other side of the Altamira field.
Altamira's field, seeming to be on East Karakas, was at the beginning of 2014 an axis-immortal epicenter protesting against the Maduro regime.
However, now that opposition has to make a greater pressure than ever to take the reference to this year, people do not show energy anymore in the country.
"I want a referendum, but because of security considerations, I will not participate in the protests," Dean said.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize, however, recognize that the Venezuelans are not so motivated.
The chairman of the Board's volunteer Tibisai Lusena comments on the statement that the Government is awaiting the process of repealing.
I'll protest when opposition calls to protest, but I know that some of my friends are scared," said Fox News Latino.
Therefore, additional to all bars that the government has raised to catch a reference, opposition is now addressed with a new claim: motivate people to go out and protest.
There was a broad support for the latest start of the referendum - people have not yet been able to buy a number in the signature phase.
However, when it comes to protest against government offences to block the efforts, the number of those coming on the mixtures is less than I am.
"A number of people are focusing on the creation of food lines, and others after the arrests and deaths of 2014 are in danger," said Cyprian Eredia, the representative of the opposition lawmaker.
After Lusena announced that until the reporting process, even greater number of signatures for the collection of all countries will be to wait until October, those who are against the socialist government claim that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to reject the Venezuelan courage, showing them that the vote is practically impossible today.
In accordance with the Constitution, if the referendum had been held in 2017, Maduro could be left from the office, but it would be allowed to be called the President.
If he had been abandoned today, he had to declare general elections.
The State Department of the United States addressed this issue in the quarter afternoon notification, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that the constitutional rights of the Venezuelan are executed.
"People steps in the implementation of the Reference to the Chairman must be carried out, specifically and immediately, thus promoting the solution of political, economic and social difficulties of the national right and effectiveness," it was written.
Luis Salamanka, a political analyser, who was a member of the election of the Board for 2006 to 2009 that changes were not soon expected.
"I don't think the rapporteur will be this year if social disasters and protests will not become more stronger," he said.
He said that Lusena and the government violate the law, but they will achieve their goal if people do not face the sounds.
The opposition invited the broad manifestation in September. Vispirm in Karacas to make a rapid process so that the refusal could be done this year.
We want people from all the country to be mobilised to the main city today.
The Government has experienced the pressure," said Eredia.
Salamanka, however, believes that this procedure cannot be so long.
"They should respond to Lucen's notification more and more powerful, as it practically kills the referendum," expert FNL said.
The Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties wanted to make manifestation more possible, but the organization of other groups wants more time.
The opposition must now be comfortable.
If people feel quiet in this situation, the risk that the second signing campaign will be low," said Salamanka.
In order to activate the reference process, aid should be received from twenty percent of the national electors, which have 4 million people.
Salamanka and other analytics are sure that even if the revocation occurs in 2017, the Chavaismo will be convinced.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political changes today.
"If the government is going to close the road to the elections, we will need to examine other legal opportunities," Eredia said FNL.
At the time of the office leaves the LNCC director A.Pouchitis.
At the meeting of the Law of the Law of the Great Word in the 12th, the Director of the Sport Centre (LNSC) supported the exemption of Ainara Pucchisch from the execution of the rights of work at the time of the service check.

2016/2017 Premier Act No.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict the 14th (Attention: it is not only the prediction of Alana, but our journalists' advice in general)
Sezone 14th
Appearance to win the low (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
It looked for the last week after a new season, as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017, the season will be again fighting for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how "scale is a glass" in Tonia Pulisa.
However, Jeremius Piss sold 88% of his club's action to Guochuan's and Pulisam's, arhetically divided hands, which the bookmaster once made as a favorite role in the first department manager.
The situation is unnecessaryly changed in Balack Country - and not only Hawthorn, but also some of the Jews to the North of Volverhampton, where chinese owners, unusing time, refused to serve Kenya Jacket.
However, the company has also expressed his desire to not change the club's culture.
"I wouldn't want to change the club's beauty or start an inevitable feeling," he said, overtaking the law.
I would like to be a good owner and put it into this long-term club.
Vispirm is our goal to ensure the remaining Premierly and then further, I will still be able to enhance the club on the top of the division.
I think it's the best in the world, and I want to move this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of Pulisa, the first aspect should not be caused by difficulties.
The next goal is to be removed to the top of the table, but the new owner and the more collected fan base will be important to hope on the exposure table above to realize that it is adequately complicated, taking into account the basic work that has been invested in the middle of the other tables.
It would be more than the past 14th season to get up, it will certainly have to work more.
Aston Villa, who seems to be at the bottom of the table, entered a smaller gate, and it is valuable to make sure that the Western Albion has averagely made less than one sithin at the gates in 90 minutes, a battle, or a division's badest range.
They didn't get ports 13 of 38 games, and there are more than one gates only in nine games.
From their 10 wins in no game did not get more than one gate, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As it was already expected, 34 gates were taken from the standard.
There is no surprise that Hawthorn ruled in the command of unconsciousness, probably after shocking 0-0, did not deal with Villa at the end of January when the hostman looked better.
On the other hand, only for the best commands, there were better protective indicators - although nobody's clubs have been held in the list of four center demands.
These protections are often not enough, especially Johnny Evans, who wants to come to Arsenal, taking into account the latest crisis in the case of players.
Northern Ireland's international committee has reached a great beginning in the European Championate, and Albion will be justified to sell.
Ben Foster's gates are faithful, and they are completed in the middle line.
Darren Flechers, largely like Evansam, showed that he was 32 years old to play at high level, and Klaudio Jacobs is insufficient.
For all the parties, it is traumatic that the long and luminous story of Saido Berahino is still not yet.
It was rejected to be the owner's rate from Stoke and Crystal Palace, but they keep peace and Mark Hjudge is temporarily.
After the last season to be close to the liquidation, it is worth to take place for all the parties concerned.
It is uncertainly talentably, but, as Pulis has mentioned it many times, it has been to go to the one, to the other, for a long time, that such relations are not working.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign documents on a change before the former U-21 class members of England to go, but the 15 million of their valuation with Diafru Saho deceived some days before receiving, claiming the club that he went out for medical checks and for everything he had agreed, but he had a muggy opinion, which would mean that he was going to release the start of the season.
This makes a big pressure on the Venezuelan Solomon Rondon, who at the past season looked hopeful, but he needs to improve his nine gates' presentation, especially if Riki Lambert continues to be so ineffective.
It also seems to be released by Victor Anichebi and Stefan Sesegnon retrospective.
Pulis in all his career is a terrible celebration with his slow new players rotation up and three - Jonathan Leko, Sema Filda and Tailer Roberts showing in the last season of the game with a non-screen 1-1 with Liverpool, dez or becomes a standard.
He will return to those already executed and tested, but Leko is worth keeping in the hour.
The 17-year-old half-year-old agency in the previous season participated in five games, becomeing the first-year-old player in 1999, which is also highly evaluated in the English football system.
The year Philips, with 5,5 million contract with Queens Park Ranger, will be, but he's the only new game that participated in the death of the first week.
It wouldn't be safe if the end could be quite steady.
"All," Pulls of the past said Express and Star about what would be improved.
Everything you're doing.
We need to strengthen backward players, the middle of the field and the next players.
The goals are, we know what we want.
They have been much more difficult than intended, especially because of the process of recovery.
The season may determine how they have started with seven largely winable games before complicated connections with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from October.
At that time, the pressure on Pulis will become less or uncontainable.
And whoever knows, may even Berahino will find a new club.
Dad Steel UK's nearest salvation operation after the authorised amendments to aid pension
The holding of pensions from Tata Steel UK said that the scheme could be restructured without participating in the Pension Fund (PPF) by enhancing the appearance of the company from its salvation transaction.
The British railway pension scheme is committed to 15 billion stars and, after calculation, at least 700 billion sterlines deficit by creating a serious deficiency of the salvation transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steel ́s in Vels.
Dad Steel is still more convinced of its business in the United Kingdom, where 11 000 people are employed, to protect after negotiation with the Economic Minister and Pension regulator.
The company plans to join its European activities, including the British business with ThyssenKrupp, the German Conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on the restructured restructuring of the British trader pension scheme and the Government provides financial aid.
Alan Johnson, the mandated President of the pension, said that this scheme could avoid the PPF if the benefits received were made.
In comparison with other schemes, this is financed, with a deficit which has been reduced up to 300 million sterlines to the appropriate measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its commitments.
Johnston said that the authorised recognises that it was "no real" to the Communication or to any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to take responsibility for the financing of the right and proper deficit.
From the scheme, the use of the benefits was a lot of binding variants than to join PPF, he added where the benefits should be accepted more unusual conditions.
Dad Steel's sources warns that it can sell Port Talbot.
The company has been consequently refused to guarantee the aircraft since March the negotiations on its business of Great Britain have been launched, and it has believed in the case as a bullshit in negotiations with the British Government.
Chuck in Chatterje, the Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make it "the more sustainable" business.
During the meeting of Tata Steel in India, Chatterje said that the restructuring schemes negotiations on pension schemes were going forward, but he insisted that the scheme was financed.
"We talk to various interested parties, including the British Government and other interested parties, such as the Wels' government, etc.," said in Chattery, reported Times of India.
Permanently, pensions have a known impact on the goods as a busy business, so we need to find a structural solution that is not a business direction forward.
The responsibility of pensions to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will support Tata Steel.
The potential change scheme includes the measurement of the payment on the annual inflation by the price index to the lower consumption price index and the reduction of pension payments to the minimum set out in the law.
Joneston added: "The Volunteers and its advisers have protected Tata Steel, the Government and the Pension regulator with evidence of the scheme to pay the awards for an unusual period and with a low risk degree after the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy means that the scheme's financing has not affected the last time market rates in the same way as other British pension schemes, and we are also convinced that the scheme is guaranteed on a suitable level.

If the owners of the oil are rubbers and specifically speak about the building in the technical stage, if there is such a possibility to receive support and install the building in all possible ways, it is too easy to not use it.

In the young, Aaron was a long - suffering nine in the world for his mother’s death.
The operation of the potential self-container was the appreciation of the pressure film.
Everything started when the Canadian police received a translated video record by the United States Federal Research Office.
The Royal Police from the morning of Canada has received faithful information from the Federal Research Office.
It contained the video entry of the "mockle" that a unknown person entered in the last stage of preparation.
"And he was trying to work it with a self-justed screen," the leader of the police officer Michael Kaban said.
The man in a black mask in the video entry expressed the threats of the Canadians in English and Arabic, and promised to deal with what they had done with the Muslims.
Approximately three hours, using faces and glass computer recognition programs, the Canadian police have come to recognize this man.
It was 24 years old Aaron Draivers.
He has already been in the supervision of the test service for the celebration of the terrorism and radical islam ideas on the Internet.
The Driver was determined to continue and also to be involved in any radical organization.
However, the authorities did not believe that Draivers could find a physical threat to the surroundings.
When the police came to his home in Stratroy City in Ontario Province, the young man came out to Â and sat in a taxometer.
At that time, the order officers wanted to arrest him, but Draivers, sitting on the backing seat, was a workshop.
I wouldn't allow the detonation of the second screen, the police were on a new man.
He's dead from the losses.
Taksometra shofer is not a tissue.
The neutralised terrorist father Wein Draivers in the Canadian television interview said that his son would be turned to the Icelandic adolescent.
This first helped him to end with drugs and alcohol.
Yet, Aaron was a problematic young man who was a long - suffering nine in the world for his mother’s death.
For the time I saw this video today, I wondered how far he had gone.
I didn't wonder he was so radical.
"And I didn't even know he could speak in Arabic," Aaron's father said.
Canadian police recognize - if they had come for a few hours later, the development of events could be a cruel one of the other.
Radjeviča will come to Rio as a tourist and will support Latvia's clusters.
In the Olympical Study, in the former Olimpiete and Ineta Radéviča, in the Olympical Study stated that the seventh sportists Lauras Ikaunieces-Admidny presentation of the first two disciplines were not bad, taking into account that sportists were trauma.
Laura’s reflexion has been made in the middle of herself with a good foot, not as a placed on the left.
Radjeviča showed that it was a comparison - just as a man who wanted to write with a good hand, it would be immediately pressed to write with the left.
It is therefore not wrong to take into account the tragedy.
Creaviča was rejected, not yet contacted with Iconizzi-Admidin, but she followed her starts and feels with her.

However, if, since the past seventy-years of the past, George Gershwin's work is not even printed or re-evaluated, even if it does not divide a chestomatic single number as the Summertime periodic reference to the shot (including the title work at the Vasar Festival of Ineses Galantes), the projects of students, hotels and similarly.
It has its own reasons - since Latvia is a civilized worldwide country, it is the binding rules and authorisations of the patriarchs of Gershvin, which are in force for Portugal and for 2030.
The harmonisation arrangements are not simplified.
Furthermore, by making a full study, the author wanted all fourteen soldiers to be black.
In Latvia, of course, the existing debates and contexts of the United States in the area of race are little known and the composer's wish would be difficult.

Secondly, it's a great step order.
The Harismate Dramatic Baritons Lesters Linchs (Portugal) is loved in Europe and America in the song, whose reperts are both a baritone and a basbarite party, itself in the operations.
Poorsia's role is not to be broken, but to Kraunu - he felt in this operation as a fish in water, and also encouraged the shopping partners even in the concertation to burn the emotional air of the poor poor people's solidarity with the poor.
Latvian Mura in its second Concert Legion and the Concert (the first occurred in 2012, not less than with Berlin Filharmonics and Series Simon Retlu) was as a vital plastic divers glass style combinator with dramaticly thorns and fantastic plan in the top register.

The attracted Jamaica's tenor of Jermina Smitam, which was aimed at the Boston study, is a role of the company in the four continents of the Narcodyler Sportinlaifa.

The Smith is one of the cleansed cleaners who are in the ball, `et, hidden still no vocal opportunities as 15 years ago when the oper vote has not been found, carrying it in order to disturb one-third.
It is unbelievable that even from lines 24 and related in the darkness of Jermein, the expressive wheel language allows him to see the happiness mass in his hands even if it is not there.
How should poverty not follow such mephistophelic coach, which is empty in the place of an illusion of the wonderful in New York?

In a sufficient dynamic activity, a few of the Commission's positions made a cart in the Latvian passports.
It is also a very proastic deterioration for the integrity.
First, some soldiers sang several episodes (which sometimes caused difficulties to follow their identity).
Secondly, there are many dialogues in Portuguese, talking about simple fractions, a replica, which is easier to follow in front of them.
The auditors have helped a titra machine.
The captains did not deteriorate and the first part of the concert management was low for a long time.
However, most of the listeners were not allowed to stay until the end of the artists.
Nine of the evening are too long for the start of the full-length operation, if it is expected to be a longer home from Césim, but the Opera Porgius and the ́s are valuable to return to Latvia's musical entry and, probably, will become one of the most funeral musicians of this vasar.

Mr. Riodejaneiro has already arrived at the end of July and will leave Brazil at 13th, and, probably, there will be most of all the national federality presidents.

Latvia Riodejaneiro's empire games will be represented in 11 sports forms, and the Agency's LETA accounts shows that the president of six or seven federalities will lead to the most significant trials of four years.

Vasilij’s natural wheat of Latvian women.
Worldwide Russian Mode History, Interior Decorator, Scenagraph, Book Author, Reader and Collection Acts Alexander Vasiljev is often visiting Latvia during the end of the year.
Recently, "Mus and Mrs Latvia 2016" assessed the final competitors and admitted that Latvia's part of the Russian part of the family representatives can be nice with natural brushes and lips that are not improved by silicon and botulin injections.

That is why he also took great interest in the evaluation of "My and Mrs Latvia 2016" members.
As the standards of Latvia's beautiful competition from similar competitions in Russia, Vasilij highlighted that Latvian and Russian people have a completely relevant fifth: "The Christian members have a greater competition in Latvia's competitors."
However, Latvian youths are beautifully dressed and saffred, and can be grateful with natural beauty, not with plastic chirurgical works.
Therefore, I have particularly discussed the Latvian beautiful concurrents with their natural beauty.
In relation to his professional activities in Latvia, Vasilijev has great plans.

Please help!
Please invite our son, brother, to treat the child.
We, Rinalda, are grateful to the fantastic people around and to God that we have had the opportunity to save Rinald, but, desirable, there is no longer any opportunity to put the medical costs on their own.
Rinald Grinberg is a 11-year-old black man who ended July.
This year he ended the 4th class of Milzberg begins in school with excellentness, powerful sportist and talenting artist.
I'm sure it's all done to him.
Good, happy, unfortunate, valuable, and a boy.
Always smile and good.
On July 26, our family will remain in memory forever.
In the last few weeks, the head pain was disturbed, but the doctors wanted it to be a virus of a furnace.
And at the beginning, it seemed that it was.
Because who could imagine that so "invisible" symptoms of the fault have a lot of serious seriousness that is not open to mind.
On July 26, the diagnosis was diagnosed - Rinaldam is a head brain wheel.
Soon, the breath of the head in the heads, but everything that the doctors can help in Latvia is to do is to make a shopping operation in order to rely on a new room, because the chirurgical activity is practically not available.
It cannot also be determined whether the adult is good or unfair.
The following national payment plan: starting and looking at what is happening.
Like in such a poor mood, we'll experiment there, we'll put out the results.
Happy is the possibility of Rinalda research results in the doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice-President of the World New York Association, one of the leaders of the world.
He undertaken the operation, showing that it had to operate immediately.
Auday creates a huge pressure on the wounds, and the risk of complication is too large.
It is also necessary to understand whether the adult is beneficial or irrelevant to develop a plan for further treatment.
Without thinking, they chose to go to Spain to save the son.
In the fantastic context, Rinald and Mom Eva were already in Spain on 8 August and was operated on 9 August.
There was a complex operation of more than 6 hours.
Operation occurred in the Santa Elena clinic.
Exhibition of most of the plant, reduce pressure, get analysis examples.
Rinald is already traveling from the wallet and as a good young man, to the evening he has nearly carpets.
Now on-cological analysis results must be expected.
Thank you for the doctor Araezam and the clinical management, who understanded and operated steadfastly without receiving full payment for treatment before the operation.
They believed that the rest had been paid, only 10 000 euros were required for the first contribution to operate and save Rinalda.
6 000 euros have been produced by sale of technology, but the rest of the amounts of the road outcome, for life, the first instruction of the church has been issued to take care of radios and friends.
But at least 24,000 euros in order to be estimated as the first phase of treatment in Spain and pay the money we have taken for the first league.
Please help us repay this, a so important operation for the health of Rinalda.
Each euro is important to help the expenses of operations already made and to continue Rinalda treatment successfully.
The signs of unmarried signs in Ukraine begin to ask: What is the Wladimire in the Guide Council?
It is necessary to judge the truth of these claims.
Ukraine prevents them, but the United States and the European Union claims that Russia has not provided any evidence.
In the recognised analysis group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has been detected a number of signs of disturbance in Saturday, but too little to be able to break the mask's large plans.
Russia is known by the decreasing or incorrect interpretation of events for political purposes, in particular in the context of the conflict of Ukraine.
This does not even mean that all Russian statements are not found.
In the past year, Ucraina's counterparts have overcome electricity pilons that have been purchased by the Croatia stream, and some of them have also been involved in crimes and crimes of human rights.
The gender of the attack is still a current question in Croatia, although there is a little reason for the fact that the government of Ukraine sponsors the scene of such events.
The pictures of the source analytical foundations also show that Russia has always increased its military building since at least last Sunday - before the planned attack occurred.
They are able to be like a half of the conveyment of heavy weapons, including the cancer systems designed for the protection of crash.
The Russian Scaling Traditional
Repeat reports show that Russia's Rotation has already been planned at this time, which could help to explore activity, although it would have been a great consensus that it simply had occurred in one of the most recent periods of spray since the anexion in 2014.
It would also have been known in the week's death, but Mr Putina will certainly be more concerned about his expressions to Ukraine by choosing the use of this episode so that it would be a greater goal.
Analytics reflect the dangerous faces of parallels with how Russia has been maintained before previous military operations against Ukraine.
In February 2014, with similar speech and military manuscripts, the protection of the volunteers of Crimea to take a half-sala, which has yet been controlled by Ukraine only to repeat that they were actually the Russian special units that started the military occupation.
In August, when Russia's supported separatists were not conducted in Eastern Ukraine, Putin exposed a long limit by warning that they might need their ethnic protection of Russian citizens in Ukraine, who were attacked after it said.
He organized a convey of assistance to the region, which, with NATO information, was only the reserve of Russian investment.
What is Mr Putina planning to do in Crimea?
Some mentioned whether only Moscow planned another military intervention.
The battle in the Eastern Ukraine has been increasing, as it was before the attack in August 2014.
However, this parallel could be the point where fear of military operations, not of real activities, is that to Putina, both in relation to Ukraine and the Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, the Professor of the New York University, who investigates Russia, showed that Crimea would have a small importance as a point to start military operations against Eastern Croatia, limited to Russia's Southern part, not to Crimea, and that the other country is better protected.
"State at all a small opportunity if the Russias really plan a big official," said Mr. Galeoti.
Immediately, "We can make a classic Russian strategy pressure."
International peace negotiations on Ukraine, which were once a mechanism that Putin pressed contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the Crimean anaxes, all more people are considered inevitable and inevitable.
By deceiving that the stand is threatened that the conflict can rise again, Putin gives a new meaning to negotiations: getting his position from the inconsistency.
"That's the standard Putina tactic - he wants to start from the Âa," Galeoti said about the peace negotiations designed at the beginning of September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wish, I could do everything more, much worse."
By agreement with the Western
Putin also said that during the Krim's association, there was no significant importance to continue negotiations, demonstrating other parties to return to the board of negotiations and to start in the process centre.
What does that really give him?
First, this allows Russia to continue to strengthen as the worldwide, although its economic volumes are less than Australia.
Secondly, it positions Maskva as those who belong to old rights to Ukraine's sovereignty, to maintain the country in Russia's control.
This may also be the benefit of the long-term hopes of Putina on a wide range of agreement with the United States, which would be resolved by their conflicts on Ukraine and Syria, with the positive conditions for Maskva, also by ending the Western sanctions against Russia.
This objective has been decreased several times, mainly due to the reduction of national oil and gas export values.
Since the attack in Syria in the past round, he again called the Western town to join him in a large coalition against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may consider that they should ensure such agreement before January when the term of the President Obama's mandate is expired.
The Russian officer believes that the President will be Hilaria Klintone, who is the most vital against Moscow.
Donald J. Tramps, although I am able to resist Russia, is considered unpredictable.
Instead, Obama is considered as one who "search solutions, not conflicts," said Galeoti.
So there is a sense of closing a window to believe that something is done for.
If it doesn't issue a wide range of agreements, it seems that Putin is satisfied with the preservation of the neighbourhood in Russia's weakening, which will be further.
The previous version of this article was incorrectly indicated in the year when Russia encountered the Crime from Ukraine.
This occurred in 2014, not in 2013.
When the Congress arrived on the street, the White House turned the funds to fight Zik’s virus
Thursday, the administration of Obama stated that 81 million dollars would be removed from biomedicin and anti-medicin and health programmes to pay for vaccine against Zicvirus, as Congress did not approve new financing viruses.
Silvia Metjūsa Barvela , health and humanitarian services secretary, reported to the members of the Congress that the National Health Institute and Biomedical Enhanced Research and Development Authority will remain without money for the fight against skin transmission until the end of the transport.
Therefore, in order to stop vaccines at a good time, Miami increased the number of cases of Zika.
In the United States last week, 7 350 cases of Sikas virus were registered, mostly Puertorico (a.k.a.
Mrs. Barvel said that 15 kidneys were born with Zic virus infections.
Virus may cause brain development anomalie and other heavy infectioned mothers to be born.
The expansion of disease in the continental United States, where the first cases were registered at the end of the past, has extended the political rates on the reaction of the federal government.
Hilaria Klintone stopped in the midday campaign in Viennavud, Miami's surroundings, which had been seen in a measure of transportation of the number of Zika virus cases, and pressed the Congress to return from its five weeks to confirm the financing of the rate for the fight against the virus.
The President Obama and the Republic of the Congress, most of the years, have been in contrast with Zica virus issues.
In February, the rate of Obama was required of $1,9 billion.
The Republics stopped it by making a detailed report on the money used.
The legislators have long been concerned about how much money should be granted and how it should be lost.
In the past, the democracy blocked the review of the measures proposed by the Republic when a 1.1 billion dollars had been granted to the fight against the Zika virus but included conditions which would be provided for for the planning of anti-conception funds in relation to a virus that could be so transferred on the road.
This road caused the White House to be pressed in April to break $589 million, which was intended to fight against the Ebola virus, to fight against Zikas virus. About two thirds of the financing would be used within the country.
Thursday, Ms. Barvela said that her department has expired the most of the money and that it will be completely expelled until the end of August.
"Unable to make decisions on financing for the fight against Zika virus, the administration has left to choose between the execution of the important vaccine work and the deal of other valuable national programmes to avoid this exemption for time," Barvela wrote.
Democracy will focus on this notification in order to translate additional money to the republicans for the fight against Zika virus.
The representative of Nancy Pelosi from California, the leader of minority, invited the representative of Paul D.Rayen, the Court of Overstance, to repeat the Congress on the continuation of this action.
"All opportunities are dismissed, and now we are at the National Health Institute," Mrs. Pelosi said.
Mr Rayna's advisers say that the destruction of the funds was a step that had to pass ago, and that Obama's administration has encouraged to express a significant political benefit from the problems of Zik virus.
Last week the National Health Institute announced that the vaccine against Zika virus clinical exhibitions with 80 people has been introduced and hoped to start the second phase of "Zikas virus epidemy" in the countries at the beginning of 2017.
However, as the officers stated on Thursday, without subsequent additional financing, it will be stopped.
Barvela said that she would be struggling against Zikas virus 34 million dollars from the National Health Service, which was designed for medical medications against other arrangements, including cancer and diabetes, to search.
Another 47 million will be read to the enhanced biomedical studies and development institution supporting medicines and vaccines by reacting to health health cases.
This money shall be from several accounts, including 19 million dollars from the programme in which a small subsidy subsidy is granted to minorised women, and 4 million dollars from substance dependence programmes, such as opioid dependencies.
Even as Barvel said, with additional money, we'll only be able to do when the agencies will "reduce their activity" in the fight against Zika virus if the Congress doesn't happen.
During the last four phases, the Centre for the Control and Profile of Patients has endured 60 million dollars in order to help States protect pregnancy, 25 million US dollars to strengthen their ability to Zikas virus and plans to fight against it, as well as 16 million US dollars in order to help it create data benefit systems in order to detect microcephalies and other symptoms with Zik virus.
The Thailand leader associates attacks to tourists designed by constitutional changes
In the lead of the Thailand Hunt, the fifth day, the national people were invited to be patient until the investigators had a disaster that had been behind this week in Thailand.
General Prajuts Chun-ocha, leader of hunt and Prime Minister, said that criminals were "godly people" who protested against the new Constitution that the voters were voting in the weekend reference.
"There are bad people, and they worked before the reference," he said to the people.
In the five boxes, on Thursday and Thursday, including Phuket and Huahin, in tourist places, were killed four and killed by daughters.
The authorities may claim that the attacks of consumers in other countries have been .
Analytics claim that the goal of bombs was not to kill many people, but to cause damage to the tourism industry, one of the Thailand people's air points.
In Huanhin, at least nine state tourists were interrupted.
"In order to be the mot, the attacks and the attacks of consumers, the Hunt's claims that after the reference, it will be stable," said Sunaj Fasuks, the human rights Watch researcher.
These attacks lead to discretional effects of the authorities, terrorize the interconnection and damage to the tourism sector.

The police claims that these in their views have not been held with international terrorism or the incoming islamic immigrants in the south of Tailand.
They consider attacks as a "placed character sabotage", rather than terrorism.
The designated attack time and expense is to achieve a strong political symbol.
On the fifth day when the people were prepared to blame the birthday of the king of Syria, which is considered in Thailand as the day of the Mother.
Four divisions deployed in the Queen Residence City in Huahin, about 125 languages from Bangkok, where most of them were destroyed.
The Constitution prepared for Milliarists will reduce the impact of the political parties and will grant military soldiers greater powers even if the government is again in control of civilians.
Hunta helped to ensure its winning without allowing opposers to carry out campaigns against it.
Mureu Hybert, South East Asian expert in the Strategy and International Study Centre in Washington, showed military misunderstandings about the fact that attacks were committed with unconscious votes.
The shoes were "accurately coordinated, but eyefully targeted for the creation of fear and depression, not for massive losses and losses and evacuation," he said.
In the past year, 20 people were killed in the Erevan Festival in Bangkok, most of China tourists.
Thailand's officers had the rubbers with uigors who were uncomfortable with more than 100 uigres return to China.
General Preyut, who has led hunt since 2014, when the civil government was abandoned, said that the pressure of this week "will pain the Thailand's heart."
Why now, when the country is better when it goes better, and the tourism is better?" he said.
We need to ask why and who did it.
Yellow Reaction: How the history of Simones Manuel was seen
Once I start the battle tonight, I'm just trying to get out of my legs the weakness of the community of black, which is something that doesn't make it easy to be in such a matter.
I hope, however, that's all the time.
I'm more happy than that I can do others about the envelope and I hope to distinguish the type of sport.
However, at the same time I would like to be the day when we have more, and it's not Simone, the black player, because the comment of the black pelder is to look at it, as I shouldn't have to be right to cure the gold medal or that I shouldn't be able to review the records.
This is not because I work as hard as all others, and I love sport and I want to win the same way as all others.

It was a part of the legal victory of the right of the Cookie's rights and the movement of this year had been forced to adopt a decision on the legalization of a single marriage before this year.
However, this week they have been fighting for equality, because Jin Perodia, the Ministry of Education, who is a geographic, has reached a scandal for the application of this provision in a scandal.
The scandal started when social media began to circle the contents of the pornography magazine, and people spread the speech that it was part of the manuscripts issued by the Ministry of Education.
Perdia's acted atmosphere.
The Ministry also offered aid to schools on issues that are addressed with sexual orientation and family identities in order to help them focus on the rules, but it has not wanted to impose standardized rules.
"What we want to school is a tool to resolve conflicts," Mrs. Perdodia said in the interview on Thursday.
The debate was started before national debates on a country where peace negotiations between government and the revolutionary members of the Cookie armed or FARC are held.
The political coalition and the leaders of the Catholic Church in the Oposition of the Government have been mobilised by accusing President Huana Manuel Santos of the Government of a single family union and of the change of generations.
The Government's delegation, participating in negotiations with FARC in Havana, has recently reached an agreement on generation and the equality of L.G.B.T, with which the Government is invited to adopt more inclusive policies.
Government's criticism and peace negotiations, held for 42 years in the Old Peridia, to the cooking stars of the Cookie Policy.
They demonstrated in the midsts the packs and some have also threatened the violence against him and her partners, Sesily Alvares-Corea-Glan, former ministers of trade.
Perdia has maintained a wonderful peace for all the weeks of disruption, trying to correct the error and restart discussions with conditions.
"Partially what I have to stand and keep my head is the knowledge that there's still going back," she said.
This is a closed working field and a single time.
She also focused on the peace process and the debates on L.G.B.T. students.
As long as the people continue to evaluate the benefits of the FARC transaction, which would be as a landing point of compensation, they need to think of the emergency of conflict.
"It is a peaceful country that contributes to integration or exclusion; is it a way where everyone has the same opportunity?" she asked.
In addition to this week, she was not pleasing to be a goal of excuses and excuses, she is glad that today in Colombia the gay students can take an example of her and think that they can also be a ministers for a day.
"I'm important to be peaceful and to know that they can completely perform their potential," said Mrs. Peredian.
We can't have a new selfishness to start changing something.

Macy's going to get 100 bits.
The big-factor Macy's fourth day has announced about its plans 100 factors, which are a dramatic step to help the active chain go forward from the potential injury problems: in America, it states, there is too much business for the purchase sea.
Macy's regulation decreases it operates a portfolio, often just shutting several ducks insufficiently income once after the annual vacancy trip.
However, in the case of its vacancy notice that it will cover 15 per cent of its 728 markets in places, the staff chains have taken many more aggressive positions than many similarly reduced representatives of the sector in relation to the reduction of its number of works, adapting to the variable purchase environment.
Guests and buyers will give Macy's business in New York.
Increasingly, the gigant reports that the plan is planning 100 factors.
Macy's is a lot of reasons to change: many of them have worked in small regional purchasing centres, such as the number of buyers have been particularly affected by the e-comercial inflation.
In general, the majority category has reached the more difficult time, since the purchasers are still more frequently choosing the lower prices such as T.J.Maxx and the working modes such as H&M.
These factors, even with short-term complications as even less international tourist tissues and non-compliant conditions for the season, which Macys has established in a stabilation, which takes place for more than the year.
Thursday, the company notified that its balanced sales amounts had fallen in the last quarter of 2,6 per cent, the whole weak in the area, however, which was a improvement, taking into account the bad 6,1 per cent rates of the year in the previous quarter.
The lower income was $5,87 billion ($7,64 billion) by $3,9 per cent less than in this period.
Macy's stated that it would cost approximately 1 billion dollars in the case of an annual turnover of $1 billion.
And such a large number of fabrics could be viewed at the same time as the recognition of the small-term speaker.
However, the value of the company's shares was decreased by 17 per cent on the day, showing that the investors believed that it was a proactive action that had been sent to Macy's most powerful.
In his own sense that Macy's decreases the number of businesses, it shouldn't be surprised.
The Director-General Terry Lund limit has already said that the chain is just too much.
At the top level, leaders said sometimes that they had adopted a new strategy, where the special consideration was placed on 150 of its most income factors, trying to increase the sales volumes in the markets already performed.
Jeff Jente, the director of Macy, who has been designed in Londres from 2017, said in his communication that all the works planned by the company are those in which the sales volumes and accessories are falling down.
"We realize that we have not yet adequately returned from investments in these markets and often not a level of purchase purchase that reflects our efforts in relation to Macy's mark," said Jennete.
The company announced that it was in charge of the list of operations that would be later.
Macy's said that by giving a lot of fairs and that, therefore, it is not just known how much of them will be forgiven.
Small markets will not be completely excluded from the main markets in which it has been currently performed, but it thinks that it is the covering of their business that seems less in places.
This guy will not soon be able to managers of the purchase centres, which will be counted with large drivings such as Macy's, so that their purchase centres will be at hand and keep other smaller factors.
Does your water in your powder get dangerous bacteria?
With a new place, drinking from repeatedly completed bottles may be "muther bad than breaking your dog's wheel," taking into account how many bacteria will be able to cover.
The Traadmill Reviews has assigned EmLab P&K to check 12 four different types of water bottles - with a swimming cork, with a deep cork, with a pressure cork, and with a salmon.
Each puddle sportist had used a week without delay.
Your water powder again can be as unclean as the dog's rotail use.
"Watching on the basis of 12 our tested water bottles, we found that there may be a huge number of potential bacteria cells: more than 300 000 colony units in square meter (KVV/kv.cm.)," says Treadmill Reviews.
The maximum number of microbs were found in the puzzles with lossed jackets, which constituted more than 900 000 columns of a square meter unit (KVV/kv.cm.)
In the bottles, microbs could cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood disorders.
Pudels with pressure corrosion were less than 162 000 KVV/ kv.cm, but the tissue contained only less than 160 000 KV/kv.cm.
"Dert water from these bottles may be worse than eating from your household's box," is indicated on the home page.
The greatest ain is →best in the case of pools with salmons which have only been found part of other bacteria in the bottles - only 25 KVV/kv.cm.
It could be because the water is getting up to the part of the salmon, not helping its littles and thus joining the milk of loving microbus.
In the puzzles with the microbs existing in the psalms are described as "increasing injustice".
"By the results of our test, we have made a choice of pools with a psalm and a small number of bacteria, as well as a damaged microb inevitability," mentioned in the home page.
We also know that when talking about pools and bacterias, the inexistent tissue is a better choice than plastic mass.
Furthermore, water bottles will be less microb for the cleansed places.
In the home page, the readers are recommended to cut puzzles after each use, ideally with wind flashing.
Religion must become modern or be postponed
The United States Democracy Party recently called Hilari Klintoni as a candidate to his President's office.
If I have recently taken the results, it will be true of the same choice, in January, that America will inherit its first president, the woman.
In the previous week, over the Ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Meja discussed the exhibition of the European rules with the German Officer Angelu Merkeli.
Westernly grown women are grown to realize that, thanks to education, ambitions and hard work, they may be competent and successful in any professional area.
And today new girls can target a number of existing roles by working in the highest field of leadership.
So is the long and hard fight for women’s equality finally ended?
Hillaria Klintone is at any time to become the President of the United States, but women's leadership in religious areas is still a conflicting question.
Okay, not completely.
In the religious field, women's leadership is still a conflicting question.
In the last week, Pope Francess announced the establishment of a new Commission to assess whether women would be involved in the Catholic Church.
In January 2015, Libya Lein was the first woman-byssus in January 2015, but it was only after an inefficiency in 2012.
As the reforms in the Jewish movement are placed in the rabbin road since the beginning of 1970 and the conservation of the road since the beginning of 1980, there is still an opposition to the Jews in the Orthodox Jude.
In November 2015, the American Orthodox Rabbins were encouraged to stop in its third territory for the successful support of the rabbian right-handed women in the form of warfare of the fact that women-rabine's opinion is contrary to the law.
Not without ironies when Hilaria Klintone was appointed as candidates to the President of Democracy, the group of the American Governing Rubines, who are against women, started a series of "debates" on this controversy issue.
Why is such an interaction between temporary and clean?
The Orthodox Jewish, like the majority of other religions, seeks stability in that which it considers a long term of traditional values.
This showed that the pressure was to keep on adapting to the variable part.
Those who are against women are doing it with the reason that it is not "traditional".
However, the overcome of the maintenance of traditions in such a way is its price.
And such a single-side thinking price can paradoxally introduce the tradition itself by rejecting the traditional community of a cocktail that needs to maintain the appropriateness.
In the history of the First World War of War, "Aug-Swave Army", Barbara Tachmena stresses the dangerousness of granting priorities to the tradition, which has been known as "Red Bicks Tragedy".
At the beginning of the First World War, when the war passed from the nearby distants to the heavyest artillery of the remote distance, it became effective to hide military as long as possible.
The British and German army reacted to these changes by changing their armed uniforms against the deeply stumbled and brunched.
The French warriors, however, cut off its rubbers and bikes, which made them easy for their purposes.
Adolf Mesimi, minister of the French war, proposed that the armies in his subjection might be likewise, were conceived with disappointment and opposition.
The red bixes reflected the armies and the pressure, and the military traditionists did not reject it.
By establishing a parliament, the former military minister Eagen Etheen spoke on behalf of France.
"Reject the red bikes?" he said.
Sometimes!
"There's an inexpressive and idiotic attachment to the most visible of all," he then wrote in Mesim, "they should have been evil consequences."
The leaders of faith who fighted the involvement of women in religious roles could be involved in the same lame.
Only focusing on the "traditional" religion, not putting the important question, "What changes are n's to cross the religion?" They risk to lose about 50 percent of their followers.
They also reject all the community of talents, skills and enthusiasm that otherwise would give women.
In order to continue to wake bixs when talking about religion, men can be traditional, but, as it shows, it can not be the value of the red bikes.

The royal news in the campaign has enjoyed new skills.
From 1 to 6 August, the Rojupes children and young people were in the center of the "Varavixne Tilti" campaign, where the participants were growingly exposed, sported and enjoyed new skills.
The name was not coming on the day of the consensus on which the glass was seen with a great injury.

Great joy was also made by the visit of "Mazbebrini".
The most important aspects of the lasergravier, since it was possible to imagine how the label in the computer is reduced to the child.
E. Montnich told what items in school should be learned if they want to work in the field, namely, matematics, particularly geometry, computers, and technical marking and racing.
He also highlighted that this profession needs to work more with shadzens than with muscles.
In the small way, there are individual sentences, and it is important to whispering everything.
Others better appreciate, at the beginning, the participants participated in various games, as well as designed the "herbs".
Thursday, the traveler was running along the sea from the Royal to Josena, and on the road, natural materials used later to cartridge.
The sports games were also determined, which are particularly important to the participants.
We went to multi-habitants homes where we have sports and rests fields, playing football and network bombs.
Children enjoy sport activities, we have a lot of boys playing football, basketball, and every time they have something sports.
The girls enjoy more peaceful jobs.
On the other day, with a mass of self-bearing, decorated bubbles, which will be used later as character holders.
It was also a talenting evening, and it was chosen to get together, and one evening was offered for advantages.
It was also played board games, each of them was able to parse his knowledge during photo orientation, where after cars had to find objects and to be photographed with them.
Updev^ was in each image to be gathered differently.
We also crossed mandales - some of them like it more, some less.
Never will be one work that will please everyone - the other is nearer to sport, the other create a work.
"Now it seems that everyone works hardly with a glass review," said Mr. Folkmane.
The terms of creation, sports, as well as help were issued in the terms of nominatne - several helped to participate in competitive works.
The name "Varavixne Tilti" has been created because it is part of three units - Rojupes and Melnsilla children and youths start the center of the Roya's multilateral center "Strops".
They're the united forces.
If the soldiers think something more important, we will take the ideas; if the second is, they will take care of us.
We're divided in the campaign.
In this year, 30 members - who worked during the year.
"We had been predicted that it would be 30, and it also meet," Mr. Folkmane said.
The nametne has been resurrected for the fifth year.
It started in 2010, when the news of the Royal Society decided that multi-children generations and t'family families needed to organise the campaigns in the morning.
However, at this time, the employment in the Royal is improved in the areas, and the village is currently designed for innovative people who work and work in young people's centres.
The objective is consistent and has completely passed on a free time.
Earlier, two campaigns were resolved, and each of them participated in 20%, but now on the basis of the reduction of the number of children in the country, only one inhabitants are made.
Similar activities have occurred during the next year.
Children in the mark, the beach glass, came to the town One's Montnich, who taught the cooking, the design of machines from the cock, with fig trees made different forms.
There is also a new technology - encaustic, it's combining with a warm west coast.
Ice Shelkov's leader was in the form of work from polymer material, forming cowls and various disorders.
We're doing honeys from natural materials, interesting mandales from pools, winters, lingeries, wheat pages in the wheel.
We are trying to use what we have around.
The center of youths in the north works from 15.00 to 20.00, then on Wednesday - 14.00 to 20.00.
"In the middle of the juvenile centres visit 15th day," Mr. Volkmane states.
She emphasizes that great support provides a Royal new idea, which understands that it is necessary to grant funds, because they form our assets.
Charlton Athletic fan " can get season billets only if it signs a conduct contract" and agrees not to criticize the club in social media.
In addition, we recognize that each has the right to his personal view, the publication of customs comments in such households as no.
The worker was then told that he would have to receive a billet personally from the former police inspector Klifa Iger, who joined the club in the last year after 35 years of the police career.
The letter continues: "I need to inform you that the granting of the season billets will be updated by the condition that you sign the "Sharmonised Behavior Treaty" (ABC), where you will be determined that you will continue to be rejected from the publication of unintentional or mullant comments on the club or club representatives of all types of social media in the homes or any other way of conduct that might be considered antisocial."
During Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after a season billet payment that it had not been received, and two days later, a letter was received.
Last night he came to the club and said, "They told me that I was too much "two" by showing that I was too funny too.
Friday breakfast in Dalmation's springs
What do you mean with the word "greatness"?
"I'm going out of all," said Colina, the former commander of the US Sea, who just took 25 Jewish ritebrows in the center of the Croatia Island, with no place there, except the rocky swimming and swimming seaman exhibited in the neighboring mountains.
Some ritters can sing heavens or numbers of kidneys to be easier in the mountain.
Colinas Petia recommends "The Little Engine That Can".
Other numbers of rands or simply slow in the hearing, thinking what it requires to occur in the transam similar stage, which is spoken to the rubber.
Colina's lame is sooner than multi-diversity.
Use some herds in front of her is like heavy Grant's eating as a film of "Cheaters and Bears" at the beginning.
Its and my mission are a long weekly "luxus" jachat and ritebra's long-term Croatia's Northern Dalm Coast and Islands organized by Freedom Treks.
The breaking in the west of the mountains places as Croatia can not match each understanding of the travel, but it says that the North Dalmation is easierly chosen than South Delmation, our seat is mystery, and when we have completed the forms of reservation, free and convinced before all of them, it was a ship that we did not mark, which would have been able to ensure us with the battery charged e-velospedae.
The part of the deal is our payment house for a week, actually the new "Melody".
At the end of the Brauciena, we can shake our whales in the coast at our springs of Ivan and Ivan and the ship in the back of the white water, without disputeing with sea eggs, as well as stones and other people on the rocks of stones, which the ships are called as a plumb.
In June, the water temperature in the sea is perfect, all agrees: enough hair to be stuck, but it is not.
On the "Melody" seems mask and smoking boxes and some cajaki, if some feels energy after hard tomorrow on the walls.
Instead, most of us return in our cabines with airconditioners, where Helena, the vessel massier - I don't agree - will already be our rubbers, have extended our minib positions and left a new box with chocolates.
Ivan says that the exhibition after breaking is tragic, and we learn to go out to our woods or with the rocks of throats on the top of the roof, together with an Antonio, who is always worth paying one of our cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m of the width of 15 cahits and half-country service, not exhausted super-jack, but a stylish small cross ships.
It goes to a small town of the island between fishing ships and football flights, and we are nice to belong to them.
Colina and Petia belong to the group of friends from Vasington (Choebie area): to sports and accessible agents after 45, as they call themselves.
I spent a year old and awesome Friday in the Netherlands, they were so exposed that they decided to deal with something more richer and now they were in Croatia.
Competitive chapter of their church is a ship and a fresh day in Provans, and each afternoon the air communicates a competitive Facebook publication ra`pong ra'i.
The element of the daily survival can be overcome because our graph is not anything if there is no specific mode.
"Books and dinners are in eight," Ivan announced the new members to return with when we started the way from the beautiful old Trogir gate that looks near from Splita.
One ship's call signal shows that the buffet is recognised, but the second calls at the end of the malty calls for listening and carefully listening to further information.
"Good!" is a cultural context that may have been lost everywhere but not in the British continent.
A difference is that the experience has already been increasingly turning around, not as the rain of overflow, while Ivan is distributing the day excursion cards, but we all insist that we are threatened by anxiety, exposure and profile with steps and steps, even though any other would be surprised in Croatia's well-being, which begins and ends at the sea level.
"This is like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
The full similarity is not recommended.
Ivan is guided to inform the community in parallel, freely through English to German.
There are weeks when he needs to end with two different nations, but we are a simple group - Swiss, Germans, and British, who are easily combined with the tables in which two speak English, but at one - German.
We're all friends on the road.
Increasing breathing promotes →discrimination, and the unique competition is inside, respectfully, with themselves.
I will not remember when the group's dynamic would be by the harmonised acid and the relaxer.
Soon we're going on to Ivan's wallet.
A little grade is a snake that should not be touched with an inequality that is good.
Matadates are serpents and right in front means right: simply, but not always easily.
The instructions of rubber are always: "Use one, hold the distance, and they have no consensus.
Let's go in nine.
All right, five couples - to me that you're on Friday.
Take a lot of water together.
From Trogir's two days in the north cross through Cornati's archipelague, where we will go out in the whole length of the Dugi Otok - the horvish language "garo island" - and after a little swimming, we'll go in the coast by the Telašcicas natural park by sharing the clinth and the salt east in which the channel is under the waters of the sea.
In the fact, those who pay it by thanking it become younger.
If we do so, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
In the small island of Molata, we moved to the south, moved from the continent to the nearby islands.
Most of us are on the empty little ce's by the country with large views on the sea and multi-speed country: olive box, wine d'acies, axes, Middle-Sea swimming air and increasing torches in the flight.
We're going forward, it's always quick, but when Ivan's starting to stop, there's always a big yellow, and the little wheel's like a wallet to those coming more.
Sports and contemporary installations are many in the week-ends, and they know behavior rules, by warning on line and leaveing free places, so that the motorists can carry out food manuals more possiblely.
"You've been pleased or found," one witchman says to another after he decided to make a busy manufacturer in an invisible box and quickly burned.
Good luck worked.
Ivan distributed us in three groups every hole to go through the main stages, with Ivan in the midst of the wind, to encourage and "seat time", as Ivan says.
If we have to break the main road, we are all gathering, getting out of the whales and security after transiting with our whales on the other side as we are trained, not before.
"Did you think Ivan know that he doesn't talk to a kids group?" He asked the Swiss ritebra when we stand on the road and wait for a signal when we can shoot it.
Not all the afternoon, we can take time for the rest of the day.
The cities are viewed in Zadar the Roman fore and the sea's rubbers who play music that sounds as a catched sea moon, through the rocked wheels in the promenade and recognition of water.
The glorious sailry is closed perfectly to enter between the eating and the pound, and after the dark coming, we return to the sea rocks and see the wallets worked lamp games in the glass tree, which is actually deep wheel.
When "Melody" goes tomorrow the way to the rose biograd creature, the song of the rubbers is no more than a smiling.
On the fifth day, we are completely free from the breakdown.
The spring of the spring of the Krka River is to consider its waterskriptes; then the next day's review excurso in Sibeni, where we look at the cathedral, the Dalmation Renesenance work, as well as the cross-time posts on the peaceful Zlarina Island, looking for the coral of its duty, makes an interesting day.
Lurda is to take the festival attacks in the enemy

Tayat, or in the car industry, there are my problems with the prices of demo, Ruth answered with approval.
Of course.
Car purchases are both from service purchases in which price manipulation is easier.
The car must be paid in any case, in the final result, because it is required to be removed from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Whether the purchase statement is incompatible and cannot create quality purchases, such as in the outcome, it is often unrecognized, "economy".
"It is now that the purchases are built to get something specific, and then there are all wonderful things," said the Vice-President of the Auto Association.
He showed that it is currently available to speak about the deployment of the lower price offer to the most significant offer as the criteria for the determination of the purchaser, however, a bad view of these matters.
Now it's 日i - let's get from the lowest price to the most significant offer!
However, the criteria should be set in both cases and, when they are taken into account and evaluated, the decision shall be adopted at the same time in accordance with the principle of the lower price.
The technical criteria in the purchase of quality should be appropriate for precisions and markets.
However, the points do not evaluate anything that can be expressed by money.
It is not appropriate to evaluate fuel consumption, emission volume, service services and similar matters.
The knowledge is the intended cycle of the car, drag it, etc., and it can be simply all together.
"The question is, then, just about where the scenarios are interested in itself?", said Rutin.
In the Manager of Auto Association Projects Peter Rubulis noted that the problems are in the case of the fact that the same person often forms purchases for both cars and workshops and food and these purchases are removed from one model.
M. has also brought advice to the detailed absurdity of purchases, which was difficult to be called more than the detailed absurdity.
"The trial is that the buyer often misses any understanding of the purchase item and the requirements are simply copied from anywhere," admits Rubulis.
Instead, Rutinch added - as less is the structure that declares the purchase, because there is a greater problem.
"Accimredzot it is because there is no human resources and competence," said the Vice-President of the Association.

The niger was not yet possible when sports arrived to the morning injury, although at the end of the basein was recognised 13.00 after the time of the period - only 2 1/2 hours before women's 3 meters.
The water seemed closer to its normality, however, with the green wheel.
The Americans denied Ebbie Joneston, who spoke to the trompine, told her that she came to the rebellion only to learn that the basin is without any warning.
She said, "#FixTheSwamp (slave purvue) should be in a mode.
The British Nirjeus Toms Deilius, who cured bronze synchronised platforms, also the basic station of the twitter input.
We hope that that it means that we have not been in the last days as bad!
Mario Andrada, the main speaker of the Committee of Organizators, stressed that basic links are worth by giving green light to 3 meters previews.
He agreed that some sports were in the water, but he said that it was a result of cleaning efforts.
"We multi-fold repeat what we have said all the time - water in any way does not threaten the health of sports," he said.
On the first day of such water processing, one or two sportists had the eyes of them.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we decided how water becomes green, was using one of the chemicals - chlore - that is used in peldbasine often.
We immediately reduced the amount.
We tried water again, and it was completely responsible for the parameters.
Simon Lengford, the main speaker of the Marie Lenkas Waterport Centre, said that the basein was a additional cleaning work.
He said that decisions are supported by the World Government Organization F. (International Pelding Federation).
"Iemesl is that the water must be peaceful, so that the basin may be more likely to come again to his white vessels," Lengford said in his communication.
Andrada said that the basin station deployment had not been prepared for surprising organizations.
"Chemia isn't exact science," he said.
Some of the things that you can do, they're driving.
In the last few days, water was made more complex in the normal area.
"There's nothing to do," Andrada said.
He added that tomorrow sports were available to the Russian trends, but he admitted that it was "not ideal."
He claimed that basin’s change was made due to the alkaline level, like acacia water can be green if it is not monitored accordingly.
When we started to do something from the area, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We can't use too many chemicals in water because sports trained it," Andrada said.
We would certainly have been able to do better at the beginning so that we would not allow the water to become green.
When it became green, we reacted to a mistake.
AP sports reviewers, Jay Coins and St. Veids Riodejaneiro, participated in the establishment of this sequence.
