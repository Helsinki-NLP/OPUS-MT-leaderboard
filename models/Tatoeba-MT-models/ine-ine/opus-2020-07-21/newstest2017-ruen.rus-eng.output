Should it go to the sanitary if there's no health problems?
Our expert is the principal doctor of the Alga Godsh sanatorium.
And if a man's healthy, he's just getting out of the work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanator-current rest is not only for the treatment but also for the profile of diseases.
In the conditions of the sanitary, a person can check his body and get a doctor's recommendation to live in order to not distort its health.
Such recommendations will not be resolved to anyone.
"Only disabled from work" is a significant signal of the body that should not be removed from it.
Permanent stress, mental and physical rehabilitation can lead to depressions and syndrome crown of depression.
And the stress is 90 per cent of the coming.
The most supported persons from the largest cities are from 45 to 55 years of age.
So it's better not to compromise the situation and give it time to relax.
Studies suggest that 98 per cent of people decrease their biological age during the residence in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatories have comfortable rest for the whole family.
So, if you want to take a break with your kids, you will not have to get away with them.
For children, even the smallest, aid programmes included as diagnostic services, advice of childhood, analysis and treatment are provided.
For example, floating (in many sanatories are → baselines), inhalation, food regime, massage, oxygen cocktails, treatment physician.
The course of procedures determines the doctor with regard to individual witnesses and characteristics of the present body.
In addition, in sanatories, normally, an an animator club works where children can visit game jobs, different classmasters.
The sanatories open their doors even for guests with children, provide the conditions for the wheelers and provide the services of experienced nurses.
The milk winter, the long-term soil, the sun-day dishes per year ( more than 300) creates good conditions for the round-friendly rest of the Kawake Mineral Water Kurses.
And then the body needs rest not only for a year.
Thus, we should not be afraid of the weather in the window, more than the majority of the procedures are carried out in the place and are not dependent on the season.
The general sanitary-current treatment is likely to take 2 times per year, especially adults.
The main figure of the region of the Kawake Mineral Water, of course, of the medical miner of the sources: Slovenian, Smirnowski, Essentuki, Narzan.
The waters of their power are unique and operate on different systems of the body.
The water is different from the temperature, the number of salts, the general mineralization, the chemical and gas composition.
The doctor chooses water depending on the self-sensition of the patient.
Yes, the "Narzan" is an opposite to the immune, immune, and restores the functions of the iron-cook-track and the exchange of arts.
"Essentuki-4" operates on the iron-cooked treaty, reduces the level of sugar.
The "New Essentucs" is an opposition, iron and mosquegonal.
The effects also include the water of Slovenian.
When water is assigned, the doctor must take into account the heart-conscious system.
If there are signs of hypertension, he chooses less salt water because the salts hold the lowness that leads to increased pressure.
The adoption of mineral water requires the monitoring of the system: water should be drinked at a certain time, at the necessary amount and specific temperature.

He tells Julia Belopuch, the agron and the dairy.
High-ground tomates are able to build a street: to remove new pastures, to cut the rocks, to remove all the sheets to the previous box with fruits and flowers with small legs -- they will not be able to see.
All tomates independent of "constitution", as well as the rubber and the bacteria are undertaken by gold-superfosphat, processing by bio-mechanisms (Dosrev – for the increase of fruit and growth, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamari, Bactofit - from sickness, Immunocytofit - to increase immunity, Biobacillin, Lepidocid, Fitoverm - if there are vulnerable ones.
Only the chemicals at the end of the year should be applied as colloid serum and green oil.

The signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is out of the crisis?
Economys have seen the signs of Russia's outcome from the most sustainable in the last twenty years of recession.
As the Bloomberg Analytic Agency notes, the RFB demonstrates the local dynamic - in the second Agency, the BDP was reduced by 0.8 per cent in an annual expression.
This indicator is at least since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data, the Russian economy's weakness in the second quarter was limited to 0.6 per cent.
The Stabilisation of the situation has also recently been stated by the Central Bank and the Mineconomist Development.
Forward is a long growth.
According to CBR experts, the Russian economy recession remained in the past.
"The Russian Index WTO says that the recession remains behind and in front is a long growth of the economy," says the Russian Bank Bulletin, "What the trends say."
The VWP module for the current quarter has increased to 0.4 per cent, and the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
As reported by the representative of the Mineconomen Development, during the second quarter, the WWP RF was stopped in the second quarter, consisting of 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the sezonally cleaned BIP waste from 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, it stopped: in April, he was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June the change in the WTO was located in paragraphs 0 to 0.15," quoted the representative of the RYA "Novacy".
The deterioration of Russian economy's fall during the last five quarters testifies that "down has passed".
Bloomberg, among other brands, indicating the characteristics of the national economy, calls the growth of electricity and railway transport, business survival.
If the year is high, it is understood that the dynamic of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be semi-based for the additional slave day.
Let's add to this a lower medium-year temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of the carriage, but it is difficult to get exact data here, and plus 0.5% of the half-year volume can also be explained at season," explains Kirill Jacobenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more evidence characteristics of the Russian economic stability.
For example, the reduction of the price pressure.
In July, consumer price index was 7,2 per cent compared to 15,6 per cent in the same month of the past year.
Moreover, in the last two weeks, Rosstat fi has deflated.
Prices in Russia were decreased in the first five years.
When looking at the dynamic of the rabbit course, which, despite the start of the year, has strengthened 12 per cent by August from the beginning of the year.
It is also one of the characters of the restoration to which indicators from the real economy sector have to go,” he stresses Jacobenko.
Furthermore, since April, the growth of industrial production is observed.
In June, the indicator increased by 1.7%.
In January 2016 to -20,7 per cent in May, it is decreased that the outer travel falls from -32.8 per cent.
The positive dynamic also demonstrates the situation in the labour market, where the level without employment was reduced to 5.4 per cent.
Below it was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being situation on the labour market, the question with the actual income of the population is to leave a better desire.
The indicator is decreased by 4.8 per cent in the year.
This factor may reduce the rehabilitation of the economy, since the costs of households contribute to the PIB.
Normally, in the economy structure, their share is over 50 per cent.
In addition to the low consumer activity, as a factor of the risk for economic growth, it can also be called a cruel policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulator maintains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not the best way in the real sector.
The negative factor is also insufficiently high level of investment, which maintains the development of industrial capacity.
However, at the end of the year, we can assume that the RF economy's falls will be reduced to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015," says the GK Forex Club Irin Rogo.
The process of naturalization of sportsmen recently launched in the Russian football and who was greatly experienced in winter species of Olimpiade in Sochi, until it was so actively developed in the summer species.
If in the Olimpias games in Rio for Russia and the expression of former foreigners, most of the cases, the resistance of the countries would be the resistance of the Council Union.
So in Rio de Janeiro, we can monitor the return process - a lot of Russian expressions under the flags of other States.
In any case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents have not left the choice to another country.
Someone had no competition in the composition of the Russian collection.
Someone believed that the best conditions for development would be established outside the border.
AIF.ru found at least 16 sportsmen who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German past of 27 years, it is written that it is Lisa Ridge.
But before she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
All four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union was devastated, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow her older sister's steps -- to take an easy athletic.
Like the sister, Lisa has chosen a six-sheater.
She stays in Russia if she would like to "move from the throne" Elena Isinbaeve.
Unfortunately, on the Olympide in Rio Lisa, we'll be the only earthquake, even if the former, in the six-year-by-sector.
Its best achievements in this way are the brain of the campaign of 2010 and the payment of the continental premium in 2016, which she revoked to the lack of Elena Isinbae.
The 29-year-old Elena Piroskov was born in Novokuzneka in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandaists of the Evangelist direction.
For many reasons of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years.
Besides Elena, eight children were grown up in the family.
They all lived in a small town of Greenfield in Masachusetts.
Lenna started to fight still in school.
In showing good results, she moved to the city of Colrodo Spring, where the United States School Centre continued to be taken under the direction of another former Russian Vladislav's Exhibitor.
At Olympiade 2012, London Elena was lost in its first capture.
That's why on the world's campions the same year is a victory.
Before this, she was able to win silver at the world's firstborn of 2010.
Thereafter, the 2013 browns and the 2014 silver.
The 26-year-old Mary was born in Jaroslavle, where she first met the synchronous plane.
But it would be wrong to say that our trainers have trained her in Russia.
The family decided to emigrate in the United States and sit in Colorado.
There Mary continued her jobs.
She had already entered the United States collection and had great results in the Panama-American games.
Understanding that at a serious international level of Russian synchronists it cannot comply with competition, but for America, its indicators are a lot.
The new name that Russianly sounds strange, Christin Suldibin was received in 11 years when her parents decided to continue training a girl's artificial hymnasty outside the ocean.
Before this time, the girl was a favorite species of Jaroslavla’s family.
By immigrating in the United States, she was quickly entered into the youth collection of this country and later entered the main national team.
On the Pan-American games, Christen 19-year-old took gold and silver.
For the first places on the world scene, of course, it was not to fight, but for the United States she organized a real break - she brought a star-roomed collection in the Olympics games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "Hooo" is Jana Berezko-Marggrandder, which is for the collection of Germany.
She was born in Tolighty.
In 2008, when a girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there was more perpetrators to fall into the national collection.
She had already represented her country at the Olympian games in London in 2012.
There, in fact, Jana was able to take only 17 places that are not sufficient to enter into the finance of the private premium.
So in two years ago, I'm the one to win a brown medal of the Olympics games of youths.
Another guy, just for this repeated, Irena Sazonova.
If emigration paths of previous sports may be called standards, Irena's family's choice is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgogradual School.
Of course, in Iceland it became a campaign of the country.
True, Ira is still trained in Russia - especially comes to a family to avoid losing arts.
She was not so happy in Rio as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in personal multi-chool.
The information about Marie Wholk's wheel in the Russian Incompetence Space is very little.
For a long time, Mary lives and is trained in Switzerland.
However, for a long time, she was under Russian flag, and the bad results were even a record of the country at 200 meters away from the batterfly.
In 2015, it received the Swiss citizenship and began to be expressed under the red-white flag.
The best statement in Rio is 14 places in the complex estafet 4x100.
In order to go to the game, the road was launched by a single project, with which she was able to collect 6 thousand franks that allowed her to pay the preparation for Olimpiade.
A 31-year-old free style fighter, Adam Batirow, has performed his career in the Russian flag.
At that time, Hassavurt was able to become a three-fold campaign of campioners, Russian champion, the Master of Russia of the International Class.
When he stopped falling into the national collection, the time was to take care of the change of citizenship.
For a few years, a talenting fighter has been a compulsory debt.
The triumphal return was at Asia's campaign in 2016 - Batiros had already represented Bahrain, for whom he won the golden medal and received a travel at Olimpiad to Rio.
On another ex-Russian, Michail Kudinov, is still less than even about the Swiss-Wolkov's Switzerland chairman.
His parents were emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very small.
That's exactly there, Michael, and began to be an active hymnastic.
He did not have great success at the international level.
The best result in Rio was 40 places in the kwala on parallel brushes.
But for New Zealand even falling in Olympian games in a lowly hymnasty has already been destroyed.
When Nasta, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family was an emigrant in Israel.
There the girl continued its employment in synchronous plane, with high results at national level.
In 2014, at the campionate in Berlin, the sixth place was in synchronisation.
Anastasia took the eighth place in the Duet with the Tetelbaum Guinea.
She was fifth in the solar programme.
Like Anastasia, the 23-year-old Dmitry Croyter is for the congregation of Israel.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate Israel.
In 2009, Dmitry was 17 years old as a campaign of the country.
At that same year, he wined in a young championite of the world.
A year later, Croyter wins the gold of young Olympic games in Singapore.
Besides the heights, Dmitrie is busy with a length and a three-year cup.
The 31-year-old Albert is another Hassavourt, who has decided to change its nationality after Russia ' s statements.
However, in contrast to Batirova, Albert chose Romania, which would be represented in Rio.
In Russia, however, he went for the Higher Cross-Master School, even became a campaign of the country in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of a SSR collection player on Jaroslav Anton's volunteer.
A bookly year before the birth of the son of Jaroslav was recognized as the best volunteer of the planet.
In the context, he decided to continue the career in Italy.
There is a family and remained for a permanent residence.
In 2015, he was a national team by a brown campaign held on the territory of his new family.
Hadjiev was born in 1994 in Czechland, and he and his family were in the most devastated war.
For ten years, parents decided to emigrate.
It was the primary goal of Norway, but it was not possible to fall into this northern country - to France, Nizzland.
There Zelimchan continued to train free fight.
In the event, he wined the first part of the peace among the people, and later the quality was to participate in the Olympian games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the fighting tour.
And again the fight, and again the former Russian.
This time you say about the North Ozethia's emigration in Spain, Timorase Frieve.
At the end of December 2012, he was assigned to the Spanish citizenship, and now he is being a collection team of this country.
Before this, the 30-year-old sportsman has succeeded with high results and in Russia.
He became a bronze prezer of the country's campioners for 2007 and 2008.
The conclusion of the non-adaptations to the congregation, Timuras decided to change civility.
The last in our list and the Czech boxer, born in 1995 in Dagestan Mahačkale's capital, Arthur Bierslan.
When a boy was ten years old, parents brought a family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, according to his older brother's advice, began to work a box.
Arthur became a campaign of Canadian three times from that couple, and in 2012 a world champion among young people.
In 2015, Bierslan won the gold of the Panama American games, the first for his new family since 1975.

Why do I have a talking class in school?
According to Gubernator V. Condratew, "the speech must be learned not by action and advice but systematic."
They must grow, and at least seven years of age, understand that they have to be wise and educated.
But as long as this work, as I do, is formal and, I doubt, more on the bullet.
If the speaking classs will take into themselves all that is before, at a new level, I will be happy.
If I'm all insulted and we don't know how, the new idea will be turned into the populism.
JKH remains one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
They have a position to achieve funds to the needs of the communal sector from the various levels budgets.
According to the General Procurement, the tariffs are one of the most exposed crimes in the field of the ICH.
As a result, the consumers of the region were transferred to energy to more than 170 million rubbers.
On the Days and Procurement of the Crossland, the facts of the inclusion in the tariff of unbased debt.
And the costs of the IW-consulting OO (subscribed to cold water) were placed on 4 million rubs on the car rent at the higher price of the market.
And such examples on the side of the mass.
The people give the last money for the "communication", which is right - according to the Middle RF, the average collectivity of people from the population is 94 per cent.
It is accused of compliance with several articles of the Code of the Court: exemption, classification of incomes received by crime, misuse of powers, etc.
Following the following versions, as the Chapter of the Fund, which was made by the restructuring of citizens, Makarov concluded agreements with undertakers, works were not actually performed, but paid.
Businessmen just returned a lot of money to him.
And as a UK master, Macarov collected money from the population, but he did not carry out the service providers and treated them for their needs.
Through the harm of the budget and the wallets, millions of rubbers are.
Makarov's machine scheme is typical for Russia.
The country has expelled the whole wallet of arrests and detentions of the UCs who have contributed to citizens' money.
On Camchatka, there is a proceeding against A. Kohan, as well as an ex-deputate of the forest that is accused of 91.7 million rubs.
As follows, in 2012 to 2013, he established 6 managing companies in Elizazo Kamchatski, and created 3 companies with responsibility.
One of them was performed for the UC, two other played the role of counter-case centres, which was the interest of the population.
However, the A. Kohan was not recalculated by the means, but the one who loved itself.
It is sufficiently difficult to judge in the JKH area.
The works are not exciting, they're drawn up.
And "Goes" in this extremely pagan resident legislation, "Sweetlan Diversnew, the Executive Director of the NP "JKH Control".
We are not able to carry out one law, as we think of a new one that must make the previous.
Specialists, including judges, also a little about the GKH issues.
The judges themselves recognize that the right of residence is very little attention.
The rejecting of voting matters, the ships in the course of investigations are also discussed in Genprocurature.
From the production in 2015, less than half of the crimes were addressed.
The remaining investigation adopted a long term, and each fifth was suspended in relation to the non-instaled situations of the accused.
The lack of legal protection bodies often occurs in spaces in the present law.
There is a law, but the knowledge bodies will not be able to excitate and investigate such matters.
In the second half-year 2015, there were approximately 230 reports on subdivisions - only 60 votes were raised.
In the five months of the current year, their number was only insignificantly 99.
What is the faal of the assembly of the wallets?
This means that the change in the management of households, financial and other issues is to address the owners' opinion.
And that also means that the market of residence and community services can't be tested by a company's standard that wants to work honestly, not to "come" the population.
There is also a small and medium-sized business.
Previously, for the account and Implementation of corruption such as in all States, Anton Jarkov, member of the Committee on Propriétés.
And this work is now active.
It's not just a single action, it's a target-oriented course to combat corruption.
Of course, not in all regions is such a cruel situation.
In particular, in the chair of scandals, and it's not going to go.
Why is there no scandal in Moscow in the field of JKH as in many other regions?
Yes, because the Staff Government has manifested the iron will and has made a series, “AIF” said the Anatoly Electoral, member of the Committee on the Security and Protection of Corruption.
I mean also the Framework Question, and the law of amendments, and the legislation.
For the managers, it was set up a good supervisory, and they all passed through the license.
Urgency is operatively resolved in the public space (and the treatment of the wheelers and the reaction measures are located on the portal of the Government of Moscow).
Many don't just pay monthly quotations, but carefully follow what is written in the house.
Awareness of the rights of the people of owners and the commitment of resource-related and managing organizations is very high.
Plus Moscow checks the foundation of tariffs on the community of services - because there are many budgetary funds and subsidies and lessons for many categories of populations.
This is probably all together and explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Looks like it's all involved in the will of regional authorities?
Maybe an unnecessary should change the job?
Turkish gambit.
Can Erdogan reject friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey Redzep Tayip Erdogan issued the Ultimate of the United States, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, the Islamic Preacher of State Transfers.
He declared that by speaking to his sides in Ankara.
Erdogan invited the Americans to refuse the support of "the terrorists of the Fethulahists".
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States call to change their position.
Experts believe that the growth in Turkey and the West increases and can lead to a new attempt to change the authority in the country.
"America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO ("Terrological Property of Fethulahists").
Or organizing FETO converts, or Democracy Turkey.
It must make this choice," quotes the Anatoly Training Agency, which was middle-night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey in a series of times, but the United States had already needed to comply with the request that they first had been rejected after the delay.
On 16 July, high-level representatives of the Turkish Army were made attempts to commit an emphasis in the country, as well as a complete trial to the head of the State.
However, after Redzep Erdogan had been introduced to the population, the delay was deceived and his organizers and participants were arrested.
It was overwhelmed that about 8 thousand people, in the ranges of which, outside the military, became teachers and scientists.
According to Redzep Erdogan, the teacher of Fethulah Guleen, who lives in Penfuan State in the United States.
The members of Erdogan also permitted that the Americans could be interrupted in the hostport and directly.
All the claims to their address have been rejected by refusing to issue Guiléad and advised to change the tonne.
The last statement of the representatives of Mrsdep on this account was sounded at the visit of Erdogan in Sankt Peterburg last Thursday.
This, however, does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists hardly on its own and also calls for other western partners.
"And it will stop to carry out its obligations within the framework of the migration agreement with the Russian Union, if Brussels does not call the date of the cancellation of visa for Turkish citizens," the Minister of Turkey on the EU's cases stated on 9 August.
According to its statement, Ancari's introduction of changes to the anti terrorism law, as the EU requires, will be threatened by its own security.
Let us note that, on 1 August, the Vice-Cancler of Germany, Zigmar Gabriel needed Turkey to stop the chance of the Russian union by promises to open the border for migrants in order to facilitate the EU's visa regime.
His words became a response to the corresponding statement of the Chapter of the IMI of the Turkey Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provocational statement of Chavushugle made in the past environment by allowing Turkey to get out of the NATO.
The Chapter of the Turkish IME did not exclude that the country would consider the possibility of exit from the alliance if it did not meet the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in defence is not a step against the NATO.
There are NATO countries who cooperate with foreign States in defence areas - importing rackets," Chavushoglu said at Anadolu's interview.
According to its statement, Turkey now needs to create its own defence system on the basis of its technologies and to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey tried to cooperate with NATO members, but the results were not satisfied, and we began to search for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that this is all about the serious divergence of Turkey with the West and the reorientation of the country to the East.
The Chapter of the International Institute of Political Experts of Minchenko believes that Redzep Erdogan is now playing and cannot go to a heavy conflict with the West.
He is very related to the Western and business points, and from the view of the military (Turkey is a member of the NATO), therefore I think that Ardogan will try to balance with the western frameworks.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more appropriate to see the post of a completely obedient person," explained the AIF.ru expert.
According to his statement, it is not excluded that after the statement of the Turkish leader (the unbalance of EU compensations, the requirement of an invisible space with the United States and the issue of Guiléad).
"Redjep Erdogan is combined with a threat to America and with a rose union, and they will provide it exactly for humanitarian problem, for the dictatoral methods of the country's management and so much more," Mynchenko believes.
The Chapter of the Political Information Centre of Alexandria Muhin admits that the President of Turkey changes its views in Russia as soon as it is necessary.
Eight months ago, Erdogan had an extreme heavy position against Russia and sought in all ways of favor at Western.
The situation changed to the opposite during a very little time.
The guarantee that the President of Turkey has no longer changed its priorities.
I think Erdogan's entered in the period of the diplom.
By being between the two polythes, the West and Russia, he will try to gain a small benefit for himself," said Mushin.
It considers that the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain the political authority in the country and that Russia and the partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting Guiléad.
Turkey also needs the EU and the United States to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
That is why the consensus with Turkey will be," says the expert.
Another point of view is held by the head of the Centre of Asia and the Middle East of Anna Glasov.
Now Turkey and the EU and the United States are sufficiently stressed, and it is in the first way with the internal policy that is conducted by the Erodogan personally.
I think that this crisis will be deteriorated, and at the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reload politics as well as in the Middle East as in Russia.
The President of Turkey and a number of Turkish policies say that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues of Syria, resolved with Israel, and active political interaction with Iran," explained AIF.ru Glasov, which admits that the step of Erdogan will be normalization with Egypt.
According to her, the political policy which is currently conducting, the return to the course, will be the outer concept that Turkey followed before the beginning of Arab revolutions.
"Thus then, in the positions of " but problems with neighbors" Turkey began to develop very actively with the Middle East and Asian region.
The very successful visits of the President of Turkey in Russia and the country have now been held.
Therefore, this external policy vector will develop and promote the strengthening of the positions of Turkey, both in the regional and international area," says the expert.
Glasova believes that returning Turkey to the former issues from the EU would be increasingly difficult, now the question is whether the EU will begin to answer Turkey hardly, which can go to the opening of migrants and create the most serious problems for Property.
Juvenile doctors: Invitations to new collective protests
The representatives of young doctors were invited to sanctify new collective protests in their new work contract.
The Committee for Youth Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) will ask for its full advice to support more collective protests since September.
JDC says that the Minister could not answer the issues of the work contract.
The youngest doctors and medical students in July vote for the cancellation of the work contract with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members, participating in secret voting.
In letter to the members of Twitter on Thursday evening, President JDC Elen Court said that the Government continued to "short up" on the basis of the problems that, as she said, led to the derogation of the work contract.
She said, "When the JDC's compliance was undertaken, the JDC's owner spoke about the rejection of the new work contract in full volume and invited the official repeated negotiations on all your issues."
In response to the silence of the Government Ru JDC today, the official request for an external assembly of the BMA Council to approve the continuing programme for the extension of collective protests, starting from September early.
The challenge led to the participation of young doctors in six battles this year, including the first universal deteriorations in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the young doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malavan, went to revoke after voting for the rejecting of the work contract, recommended by BMA.
He said to BMA members that the transaction was a good deal to be adopted during the voting meetings, 54.000 younger doctors and medical students.
After voting on Jeremy Hunt, the Ministry of Health said that this work contract would be used for medical agents in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Allians of the bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Thursday to break the hands and declare the end of the eightmonth war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the golden court room in Sankt Peterburg, I had a sustainable impression that Ann wanted more this reconciliation.
It was a handscape, yes.
But Mr. Pu's smile was the look of the eating, and he was heavy even by his own standards.
Redjep Tayip Erdogan, in contrast, spoke once again about his "dear second" Mr. Putin, five times, one report.
I lost the account.
He also promised that Russia and Russia would return not only to their docrisis level but even above.
On the next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erogan's action as if nothing was wrong.
I think his enthusiasm was supposed to be back.
But the tracting hunger from Mr. Pue's opinion that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in the introductional comments: Turkey was a Russian destroyer at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was unusual.
Mr. Putin was disrupted by an enemy tired by accusing Ankara to the Moscow struggle.
The opinion was still more likely, resulting from the proposed friend.
Resume of real confidence will be difficult, probably not able.
Russian public opinion has also been changed since November.
During months, the controlled MME States conducted an increasing, complete and comprehensive employment in Ankara.
In time, Turks had to be guilty of all.
The most serious accusations were made by the representatives of the higher leadership that Mr. Erdgogan's own family was on the illegal trade of oil from the Syrian zone controlled by the Islamic State.
He refused it determinedly.
But in Saint-Peterburg, the signal was official that the time was to move further.
Finally, this meeting was only because Mr. Putin received a excuse he requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could have been able to win her kind.
For Ankara, the benefit of the declaration of reconciliation is clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all friends that he can get, after he was almost swimming from his station in the past month when he tried to turn.
Repeat terrorist attacks to Turkey also appeared to be.
There is also a economic reason.
The Russian sanctions were very attacked — especially the prohibition of cartridge flights, which usually bring millions of Russian tourists to Turkish every year.
The quantity of rare falls nearly 90 %.
What russians, tour operators and charter companies are sure that they will be facilitated when the flights will be restored.
They put the end of the sea on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, the public television had been predicted by more fresh fibres and fruits as only the Turkish import of agricultural products will be allowed again.
"Turists there, pomidors back here," as reported in the Watchtower.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
An Árbe to Western because it considers a response to the tentative of conversion.
Add to this the deficiency of its insufficiency to the closest theme of the accession to the EU and the step of Mr Pu, which is seeking to use cold and gradually disrupt Turkish connections with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, wined bonus balls with Ankara for calling for the support of the competent authorities after the trial of public conversion.
Make sure that this is a damage for Moscow, which has its own deeply decorated fear of the change of regime.
In this brilliant holiday, Russia and Turkey allowed me to be described as a "allians of bad": two countries who feel open and humiliated by West are united in force.
However, despite the public manifestation of reconciliation, these two still have different differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently been positioned as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey supported the opposite parties.
Perhaps itself says that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, until two presidents gave the press conference, they did not even interview this subject.
The President of Turkey was promptly avoided the answer to their differences, while Mr. Putin had preferred to make them accent.
No clear agreement is how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open enemy failure, and taking into account the possibility of a full disaster when the Russian reacting destruction member Turkey has fallen, it is better that two leaders are at least talking again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be deemed to customers in Scotland
Brend RBS should be addressed to the role of the bank's office, according to the term of the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will take place for clients in Scotland.
Ross Evan told the BBC of Scotland that the RBS border was with the global bank ambitions.
The bank was dismissed from them since he almost moved eight years ago and needed to save it.
In this period, the border is ‘RBS’ to protect other consumer credit breaks.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsor assistance to the international aid from Cubka, six of the regions to the William Andy Murrey campaign.
But now it was determined that it was right to allow more national brands to go to the first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scotland clients, but it will not be started.
In England and Wales, all references to the RBS, including the external Office and the funding board, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and North Ireland.
There are other smaller bridges for private persons who will have more impact — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. Evan’s interview during the tour of customers and in Invernesshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will finally become our investment bridge and the one in which our staff will be occupied, because we are now increasingly being a bridge bank."
Since I'm a global brain, RBS's global brain.
Now I say we have no global desires anymore, we have a place of effort.
Each of these bridges will represent something fully different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these branches.
The RBS has already stated that it would not be to continue its sponsory support of the Cubka six nations, and it has developed a profile of different brans in sponsorisation.
"This is a suitable time for us to move the brand banks, since we (we asked ourselves) based on how we focus on the improvement of the bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cyclical three years ago, if we said we'd be a noticed customer bank and would close all these brains.
But with what we did, focusing on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brains again, so I think it's the time that's right.
Dector France comes to 3000 winners with winning in New Market of Pristracy
Dectors broke the champagne after a duplicate in Newmarket brings it to 3000 winnings
Jokey Frankie Dettori received his 3000 British winning in New Market on Friday.
He came to this outstanding note by using his second winner night on his home trail - at the Pristracy, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year Italian is the sixth joke, which has reached this outstanding mark in the glasses.
He follows Ser Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Idery and Willy Carson.
The three-fold campaign of Dector's joke, who had previously wined Ghayar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very relaxed because my family is here too.
I'm very glad that this happened in New Market, because I've been here 30 years ago.
It's not a big world business, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a normal dinner evening of 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very uninterested.
Dectors accept approvements when the Prevention after winning
Two juices have reached the following notes in rocks: Richard Johnson's campaign and the 20-fold campaign of Ser Antonio, who had more than 4300 winning for a recording career.
Lester Piggott, nine times winner of Derby, 4493 wins in career
Frankies are one of the best jeokees of the modern era, and it is not surprised that he has reached the mark that so few had reached him.
He is a style and alike, but his tactic smile is different from others in the weight.
He is a wonderful representative for speech, his enthusiasm and charism.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Eps, he would have brought 6000 winners, if he wasn't just a juice of outside and big shoes!
And if serious, France has brought winners to the Great Britain most of 30 years that is good to see.
He's a powerful person that's good for British shots, but more than he's an incredible joke.
Frankies Dectors delivered this exposure mark by the company's streaming socket with the loach
Franky Dector is a symbol of British flat shots for two decades.
They were thrown up and fallen.
Many winners of big speeds, including the "Major Seven" named in Ascote in 1996, but he also survived the aircraft and tried to discover because of the doping.
Three years ago, he dreamed with difficulties when he returned after six months of discovery, but he showed the great power of the will to leave the calls of skeptics and to return to the form.
And he may not have ended for a while - the Dectors said that he would like to continue to participate in the commitments, at least until 50 years of age.
Putin frees the Chapter of the Administration of Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin was unexpectedly released his head of Sergei Ivanov's administration.
Ivan was a part of the trusted nearest Circle Pu for many years.
This 63-year was now appointed by a representative of environmental and transport matters.
The declaration from Kremla states that Putin " had put Ivan's freedom from his response to the Chapter of the Russian Administration of the President," but did not call the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's substitute was appointed by Anton Wayno from 2012.
Mr. Wayno, 44, the former diplomat.
In 1972, he was born in the capital of Estonia Tallin, and served in Tokyo, the Moscow State University of International Relations.
Later he was the head of the Chairman's Protocol and the Government's equipment, reporting the Kremla Website (Russian).
When he was assigned, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your confidence."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the heads of the State in view of the draft law and control of how your instructions are fulfilled.
Putin reported to a Russian telecanale on Friday that Ivan asked him to deliver him from this position and recommended that the Guinea replace it.
Are the smiles convinced?
That's the road that made Moscow.
Sergei Ivan for a long time, I was one of the nearest members of Vladimir Pu and, as he also served in the Council Security Service, KGB.
As a head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At the meeting with the President Putin, shown on the public TV, both men declared that the head of the administration was delayed on their own desire.
But despite smiling on the camera, it has been a little convinced here — especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Are these unpredicted consequences of a fight against authority?
Until nobody knows.
But the official statement is that a person who had ever acted as a potential president, immediately wanted to govern the Russian environmental policy was met with a huge scepticism.
In the comments of Putin, quoted on the Creml Website, Ivanov said, "This is the truth that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 to trust me this very complex job, even if you could say, the problem position for four years.
Well, it seems that I was the head of the President's four-year and eight months.
Ivanion entered into position in December 2011.
Earlier, he worked as the Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Rusian Security Council and an ex member of the KGB State Security Service as well as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FPS), which came to the KGB, Ivan was appointed as its substitute.
When Putin came to the authority, he called Ivanova among the five people he most trusted.
Sometimes Ivan was deemed to be the President of Russia after the second time of Pua, since the third time for Pu would oppose the constitution.
However, this post took another close party of Pu, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin’s Prime Minister before returning to the presidentship only three and half years later.
The star's "Pense as a criminal" Thomas Gibson was released after a drag with a producer
Gibson was a player in shows in Los Angeles last month.
ABC月os and CBS Televisionées, which produce series, have announced its freedom in the joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agency of Aaron Hotcher, offered excuses on Thursday before it was declared to be removed.
There were creative differences on fees and divorce in opinions.
I'm sorry that it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information about how Gibson's person will be removed from a show that follows the FBI agents' team, as it is expected, will be made clearer by the ABC月os and the CBS Television.
54-year-old actor who played the main role in Darma and Greg's seat was in the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "Tell as a criminal" and have contributed my heart and soul to him during the last twelve years," said Gibson in his statement on Friday.
I hoped to be present in it until the end, but now it's not going to be.
I just want to welcome the scenarios, producers, actors, note team, and, most importantly, the best worshippers whose show could only be discussed.
It was noted that the show would return with its twelfth session on 28 September.
Registration: Fisheries were landed in Banfa garden
A man from Banfa was helped to recognize the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfe.
Kevin Baine believes 75 fish could be a song left by water death.
Baine, who was 500 meters from the sea, gave the seed of this seed in Periscope in hope that someone could shift light for two-to-day fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Most is now associated with Fif
The project for 1.35 billion pounds now must be completed until May 2017
The engineers joined the northern cross-border and Viadice Quinnsferry Crossing, which means that the pool is now associated with Fayf.
It's the first of the four mixtures between the winds of the floor, which are now in the end of all three pillons of the pool.
Fif's pool section is now 600 metres long and weights 30 000 tonnes.
There are also 10 000 tonnes of beton and 46 tons of wood.
The project of 1,35 billion pounds should now be completed until May 2017.
The Ministry of Economy of Kit Brown has visited the area today, and he was among the first ones who had gone from the ground to the pool.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of the engineering experience in this project, where more than 30,000 tonnes of beton were used and only used to build this part of the pool.
Despite the massive size and the weight of the powder to end the smoking between the vial and the forest, it is a virtual operation using the use of extremely precise tests for the collection.
In general, about 79 per cent of all the pool floor is now on the scene, for the last section, the beton covering is in Russia today, which means that it's quite ready for the pool.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Briová Constructors, said, "The first swimming on each forest project is always a significant delight.
This draft is the most modern building experience.
After setting up the last section of the road and associating it with the expanding North Pilote, we remained locked the remaining seat on the north, or the side to the side of the north.
This was made by the enhancement of the viaduc north approach to 700 limmeters south.
It was a high-scale operation at the same time.
The mass, because the 222 metres long wheat is about 6000 tonnes and it must have been raised to the angle of 3 per cent.
Excellent because the trials on which the team worked were small - just a few limmeters in each direction.
Fortunately, all this went very well.
Salvation in Moelfred: Three men 'rejoice to stay alive'
Three men 'rejoiced to stay alive' after they were cast out of the fishing ship in England.
The salvation of Moelfree RNLI raised anxiety at 13:20 at the British aircraft on Friday, after the team saw the event in the Moelfree Hall.
Three men of all forces tried to reach a safe place while their ships continued to go.
"We saw their ship running near them and supposed to be worse," said Moelfree Vince.
"Freely, until we came down to water, the wind brought it to the side of them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a fishing ship, and the third of 60 years was found incapable and imprisoned in the battle without the salvation of a rubber.
All of them were raised up to the ship of the rubber of the rubber and delivered to the salvation
Jones said, "Tree men who were thrown out in water have felt that they were alive and not fully able.
The ship engine had a accidental swimming, but he was sometimes dismissed from a man who managed a boat when she was disappointed.
Somebody talked about these guys today.
Pokémon Go, worth of health and happiness
It's amazing to watch the change of the world.
The fact that adults and children have no longer gone to the street to play, prefering their free time looking at the screen, was a complaint for many in the past decades.
Pokemon Go rejects people from divan and involves some physical activity.
The time in the screen was significantly TV, then video games and recently smartphones.
It's so good to see that the technology and the activity of the street are not being inter alia excluded.
I, of course, mean a total intention of Pokemon Go, applying on the basis of personalities created initially for video games in the 1990s (foldly born a series of multifilms, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other Pop-Cultural events, this has lost the former activity several years before this new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
In other countries, the charge was at the same time detained in relation to the mass response that the servers had overloaded.
In those days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter has.
So how does it work?
In two words, Smartphone players are going to search for Pokemons that are followed by GPS and are found can be "fotographed" (in your phone screenshot) or "poʹen".
The generation that played in the game, being younger, was fully involved by delaying the divans to search.
The game in the United States has led to a significant increase in the number of steps that passed by "normal" persons every day.
Cardiogram, application for Apple Watch, which follows 35.000 users, recently reported Washington Post that in two days from the start of the game, the number of people followed by 30-minute exercises has increased from 45% to 53% each day.
The company doesn't know who is playing in Pokemon Go, she's just seeing the original data on the past levels.
Many health care campaigns who convince people to "search 30 minutes", "release from the divan" and "be active every day" have not found an answer because most of healthcare messages I'm disgusting and speaking of people who look like a disaster.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical exercises is to underestimate.
Those who are regularly exercising decrease the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps correct the weight, high art pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to bring here.
But Pokemon Go's preliminary is that it's putting people on the street to do what they love.
Thus, there are three foundations of health: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
People even bring new friends to the holiday.
Like usually, there are awesome challenges that are looking for what to please.
And yes, somebody can go on the door.
Well, what?
The crash has occurred.
Despite that applications for smartphones, such as Fitbit could earlier follow the physical activity, they did not give us a way to work as this game is.
The news is swearing, and the use will be weak with time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, there are more games that will join applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good form and health.

Simon Bailez wins the gold of the absolute primacy in the female hymnastic
Forget the pressure.
Forget the summer.
Simon Bailes is unusual for all of this.
Dynamic on the opposite.
Unnecessary to the B.
I'm going to be in the field.
It's all over here.
And now, finally, the Olympian Champion.
The 19-year-old American himnast was raised to the title of the absolute primary champion on Thursday and placed the rest of the peace to convinced demonstration under the appropriate Olympic attention.
Her general ball 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the silver medalist and companions on the "Final Petterka" Ellie Risman and the Russian Bronz Medalist Alia Mustafin.
Byles from the United States is a guilt during the end of a woman's absolute priority on artificial hymnistics in 2016 of the Year Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Byles became the fourth group of American women who wined the absolute primary champion and the fifth, strengthening its reputation as the best of its generation and perhaps when it was.
She was deceived when she had shown her final general ball and her long travel at this point ended.
This achievement puts it into the same line as exclusively rare easier athletes, such as Michael Felps, which raised their species to new heights:
The Bailes has spent the last three years, dominating in its form, winning 15 medals of the world's champion, including 10 golden, with such exciting programmes in their middle of employment and accuracy that Mary Lu Retton's Olympian campaign called her "the greatest hymnastic" in 1984.
One last trial was waiting in Brazil, not as much between the Bales and the rest of this area as between it and the rate of higher expectations.
Something less than to return to his family home to Spring, Texas, with the bitter golden medals, would be considered as an unexpected expectation.
Simon Bailes from the United States, left, and Ellie Rysman is covered after the winning of gold and silver, respectively, at the end of the woman's individual absolute priority on the Arts Himnastics of the Air Olympy Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Byles for the first gold on Thursday, became a beautiful final accommodation for a prostitutional festival of the national co-ordinator of Marta Caroly.
While Bailes insisted that she had never looked at the future during her long road to the top, it wasn't exactly like that.
A part of its voluntary exercises program is that includes its company transition is established in Latin America, which would come directly as a house on the street right behind the Olympian Arena Rio.
It's not coincidence.
A girl who had been filled with her grandfather and grandmother, who started walking with a child and opening the mother of Amy Burman trainer during a visit to the village where Burman was a trainer, became a powerful force.
It did not play any absolute priority agreement since 2013 — a lot of freshness that should continue as long as Balz wants.
Despite Mustafin received a small benefit with two rates, it was a peace.
The gymnastic and in practice — where Bailes protects the call of the world’s champion — is located in the garden.
She went out again from 15,433 on the B and ended with 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman was lowly embracing it while they waited for a final account — a pure formality — and the lakes appeared around a white and white subcutanee for the Bailes eyes when the purpose she had ever recorded in the album for the cutting was about.
The exposure of Risman was a small statement in the past four years ago when she divided the third place, but lost Mustafin's brown on the Tai-Brake.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team called Americans "beauty" was very far.
She sent the foolish people after its free exercise to the revenge, which sometimes seemed to be subject to the question.
What Bailes says, the 19-year-old virus movies since the beginning of this week now have a completely new importance:
Police: 3 victims in the case of series of murder were arrested during the hearing of the car
Two women and 12-year-old girls who died during the most severe attack in the case of the first serial murderer of Phinex in the last decade, sitting in the car, talking and listening to when they were shooted, the police reports held on Thursday.
Angela Roshell Lanner, Stephanie R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the road, they declared authority.
The criminal made approximately eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, then hiding on another vehicle, reported in the report.
The police states that the three-fire murder is not seemingly the result of the furnishment, since the wrong-doer did not take a bathroom or $2.900, in order to provide one of the adult victims.
The police representative of Phinix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the slider had encouraged the investigators to check whether he had four previous attacks.
Seven people were killed and two other were hurt by nine attacks in two primary Latin American areas during four months.
"This happens in the white area before the house," said Howard KPHO, the CBS branch at the beginning of this month.
The suspicious, as they believe, was repeated by several vehicles, including the root Nissan end of 1990, the black BMW at the end of 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The inspectors refused to discover witnesses that led them to the conclusion that the attacks between themselves and the same killers were committed.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with hurt and later ended.
Laneer, 31 years old, and the daughter of Ellis, Malia, died in the chair.
The Witness told the police that they were sitting in a parked car by listening to.
Government also repeat the police report on the shooting, which was an empty picape for a half hours before a three-hour killing and which, as they believe, was the case of a series murderer.
The followers found the gels and dropped the puzzle out of the seat and the frames of the powder from the engine.
6-year-old child's mother with microcephalia: "It's going to be better"
As most of the six-year-old children, Edmund Pi loves singing, playing, and, of course, his mother.
But in contrast to most of their fellow believers, Edmund’s microcephalia is the result of a gene of a disturbance that his mother Elizabeth Pi knew not during the absence.
When he first came home, my first thought was: I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign on that.
That's not true, you're sure you're signing it," she said.
She and her husband told Vincent that Edmund might never know them and that he couldn't even survive.
The doctors even placed it in a specialized treatment institution.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing so," explained Pi.
Edmund's walking through the halls.
Edmund didn't sit and didn't use until he had been fulfilled three, and he didn't talk until that morning.
But he's along with some of these.
He walks with external assistance and goes on the wheelsipedia.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and songs.
Elizabeth shows the gear that Edmund has made for " Please, get me."
"We teach him the language of the greed," said Pi'vevo CBS News.
But not just the normal language of the greed is that Edmund has taken his own gestures.
Microcephalia can result in a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections in the period of the virus such as core and Zica.
Symptoms and prognoses can be different.
Too early to talk about how this is said to live those infected by Zica virus.
Pi seems to be the emotional loss because of an undefined future.
Did I always say what happened?
What's going on?
And she doesn't know until this morning.
I really didn't ask for a predict for the whole life, because I don't expect someone to really tell me.
But Pi seems to have a hopeful advice for children's mothers with expected defects because of Zica.
It's gonna be better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child's gonna love you.
Strengthen rain, raining serves as a cause of salvation in Louisiana, Mississippi
The strong rain and broadcast rain in Louisiana urged the Governor to announce the emergency situation on Friday, and more seeds, as expected, will be passed over the state to the Sabbath.
The National Meteorological Service reported that many rivers on the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi were out of the Languages and threats.

In South Alabama, the dejurship was expected to be held until Friday, since the rain continued to go to the mobile area.
The Comit River near Baton-Rouge and the Amyth river near the Day Springs, both in Louisiana, had to set a record of a patrol level in the past outcomes.
Synoptic Alex Krautman said that both rivers could burn a lot of houses in the garden areas near Baton-Ruja.

Magazine Brown, 6 "reserved by flames", remains alive after shot in Philadelphia
The police reports that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering the second shot in 6-year-old town this week.
The grandfather and grandmother of the baby recognized him for the CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
A grandmother and grandmother say that Brown received many fires of hurt, including his feet, his leg, his hand and his life, but was aware when he was moved to the hospital.
"He's got so much, his little body was solved by the pulmonary," says his grandfather Delores Meldendez.
I can't believe that.
The boy is in the hospital in a critical state and has overcome several operations.
The family said that it would be expected to be corrected.
He had to go to the first class at the main school.
Brown was one of the four people who shot in the Jermantown quarter.
They were also shot in three men: two 29 and a 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men is critical; two other victims were registered in a stabil state, CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car nearly 29-year-old in critical state, reporting.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police investigates whether any of the wounded men could be shooting.
The surveys reported the CBS Philadelphia that it seemed to have been a shot between several armed people.
The half-automatic ills of the weapons, which are registered by the different boxes of the lowwater, have established the place of action.
It seems that it was definitively a continuous battle.
There were guills on the street, both sides of the trotuar.
Therefore, there were several armed fighters, and they were actively in shooting,” reported Philadelphia's police captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in this area were also located.
No arrests were made, and the police, according to the reports, watched video observation cameras.
Another six-year-old child, a girl, was hurt in the hand of a school pull on Thursday when she played before her house in West Oak Lane.
It's rebuilding, and the police still look for a suspicious.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
This is what I call a woman's Olympics collection on the hymnasty of this year and for several reasons.
First, I was at each Year Olympiade since 1984, and the United States have never been so dominant.
And the second: in this collective key role, three guests are playing: Simon Bailes, Gabby Duglas and Lawrence "Laurie" Ernandes, who have already inspired so many small girls.
The composite of this collective Ellie Risman, which is a Jewish, and Madison Coshan, a Catholic, makes all to be hungry.
This collection looks like America.
This also strengthened the black and latin American female presence of this type.
In the past four years, the female hymnastic number one was a African.
Simeon and Gabby were No1 and No2 last year.
It's powerful.
At the past Olimpiade, Gabby Duglas was an unexpected Olympian Champion, and America approvedly welcomed.
The world could now be a witness to the incredible expressions of the Three times of the World Champion of Simon Bailes, Duglas and Lori Ernandes who were unexpected, but at least virtual hymnistic exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American team that wined gold in a woman's absolute priority.
And the colleague on the College Ellie Risman was acquired of silver.
We become witnesses of this kind of pig, but he doesn't look like this in gimnastic sections throughout the country.
Simona, Gabby and Lori have all chosen the same way as Ellie and Madison to build an Olympian collection.
They're "final five" because the Olympical assembly on the Hymnastic will have only four gumnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Marta Caroly's training.
But in fact, the hymnastic is a delightful sport, and the dreamers are trained in private hymnastic clubs, supported by parents paying valuation of education, funding, traveling, forms, contributions for participation in complaints, guest services (for trainers and their guests and families) and the list continues.
Most of these hymnastic clubs are distributed in rich garden areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where the gimnasts receive everything from their training, which is a delightful and long-term responsibility for the family of gimnasts.
Amy Burman, trainer of Simon Bailez, and Maggie Hani, coach Laurie Ernandes, both trained their sports from the time they were accepted for the hymnastic.
We need to create more acceptable for the price and the available education of hymnastic communications to the unusual number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I found my gimnasty fund 20 years ago.
In my own area, we have already provided free and irrelevant hymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 citizens (principally, black and latin Americans) and have developed national and campaigns.
In September, we will expand in Detroit (my family city) to provide a high-quality hymnasty for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympics species.
Hymnastic developments strength, liquidity and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability to exhaustion, discipline and sustainability.
This composite shows a positive impact on good health, success in the school and § throughout the life.
The inspiration of this collection will send thousands of girls to be guinistics, and it is.
Taking care is so important, especially for girls.
That's a wonderful time now.
Thank you, Simon, Ellie, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious Demonstration of the Women's Power in the winning of the command of Olympics Gold and that you motivate so many girls to be a healthy, and successful young women.
The younger doctors took a statement of further delay after Jeremy Hanta ' s proposal was rejected
The Ministers had hoped to conclude the amendments of the Treaty with the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37.000 young doctors who were involved in voting were rejected.
In July, Hunt discovered the plans to introduce this agreement, saying that NHS was on the "dead land" and that any further delay would cause the damage of the staff and patients.
The first younger doctors are transferred to a new contract that includes changes in work at night and outcomes to improve the service at the outer time.
Dr. Elenoko, president of the Committee on Young Doctors, said that western night in the statement, "The younger doctors still have serious concerns on the conduct of the proposed agreement, in particular that he calls on the crisis of slavery and that he cannot be applied to all doctors."
There were eight weeks before the first group of doctors would be transferred to a new contract, progress and time of outcome.
The WMA's attempt to allow negotiations was unrequestly met to take action and sometimes complete silence from the Government.
And notwithstanding Jeremy Hant's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Huntu needs to prepare now, encourage the introduction and respond to the threats of young doctors.
If he doesn't, the younger doctors are uncertain that they are ready to organize the following injuries.
After the finish of April, there were approximately 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nurses receiving, while medicals and consultants were held to provide the substitution of doctors on the picketing line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the changes of the Treaty with the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better payment for 54.000 younger doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employers, invited younger doctors to not keep the battle.
Mortimer stated, "The stakeholders have reached a little or nothing, but pressure on those already working on the front of the team and services, and cause concern, physical pain and disturbance to patients, seats and their families."
During the last two months, we discussed the Juvenile Physician Committee and together with the Department of Health and other, locally responded to their concerns that involve the role of employment and corporate information.
Workers hoped that the continuing positional approach on other important subjects — such as the definition of the staff, the discipline of training, the additional training for those who returned after the interruption of the career, the valuation of training, the recognition of the training plan, the academic loss and gender differences in medical payment — were aware of how seriously slave providers, Health Education England and the Health Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions imposed by the WMA in November, February and May.
Packaging by 2 £ per day may reduce the threat of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack will be used by 2 pounds per day after the authorities recommended to give it to more people and for a longer time.
The anti-reverse ticagrer medicine reduces the risk of re-accessions for people with heart diseases.
The medicinal product has already been appointed for 12 months after the heart attack, a lower risk of consultation or a new approach.
The supervision of the NICE National Health Service has advised the United Kingdom to give it to people for four years to continue to avoid the risk of heart-conscious problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service has now recommended that the United Kingdom provides him for four years in order to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-conscious problems.
The heart attack occurs with approximately 140 000 people in England every year, and the fourth of them is another approach or consultation.
Heart approaches and consultations resulted in the capture of grass material on the walls of artery and the forming of flashes.
If the flash is spread on the parts, it may be the cause of a tromp that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the tromp moves, it's going to move through the blood flow and lock the blood flow to the brain by calling an insult.
People who have already reached one approach are increasingly risked to get another.
Tikagrelor, a British AstraZeneca and selling Brilique, reduces the risk by making tromps less likely.
The NICE project and action today recommends that people give 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirine twice per day for the period of three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Centre, said, "Despite the effective methods of the secondary profile of approximately four people who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or insult — often with disruptive consequences."
The fear of the repetition may have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There are evidence of the fact that the ticagrelor is effective in comparison with aspirine in reducing the risk of heart attacks and advisers in people who have already been cardiovascular.
Previously, by recommending Ticagrelor, we are glad to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Since information on the efficiency and safety of the ticagreor — particularly the risk of blooding — is over three years, the draft and action are not recommended to treat the longer time.
Culture of the CCP's ownership allows the fashion of the number of votes in the Muslim regions
Ex-mer Tauer-Hamlets Lutfur Rachman was removed from the post last year because of corruption, using such a report of the Government
The political correction culture led to the closure of the eyes, which has been turned into a global faal of the counting of votes in the Muslim communities, by information from the disturbing report of the Government today.
The former member of the Ministry office of Sir Eric Pickles is restricted to the criticism of the field, the chairmans and the administration of the cities for ignoring the testimony of distortions on elections because of "through sensitivity on the conduct of racial belongance and religion".
The former secretary of the communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the threat of electors in religious fields was so strong that the police should allow to put the cordons on the parts of the elections to protect the intimidated electors.
He will make the electors take the certificate of the person to prove who they are when they vote.
The electors should only specify their name and address at this time.
The report will even be made to carry on the fingers of people when they give their bullets, so that somebody can speak twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to the notifiers, Mr. Eric stated.
He invites the press to grant great access to documents of the Council and decisions adopted by the Neo-Office committees or slave groups.
"This is not only in order to protect the power of election, but also in order to protect the Government ' s rights against the more open culture of corruption and the financial force that comes with her hand," he said.
The report was commanded by the Duning Strategy on a scandal with a vote at Tower Hamlets in East London.
In the past year, a special court discussing election issues stated that Mr. Luftur Rahman should have been dismissed from the position in relation to long-term corruption and illegal activity.
The Court discovered that Rachman had "chinically demanded" religious feelings of his Muslim community and for silence his critics by accusing them of racism and islamophobia.
Rachman, as said, "he made his campaign based on the responsibility of the Muslims to vote for him."
Before 300 votes, there were doubts or results of personality when a person votes, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there were a testimony of poverty throughout the country.
He expressed the concerns of the behaviour with the vote on the post, in which the elderly members of the Muslim community, as communicated, showed pressure on people to the vote for the selected candidate.
Sir Eric, on the graphics, introduced a few recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the request of bringing his identity certificate to prove who you are
The report states: "The evidence of the pressure shown on the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities communities, particularly for women and youths, was presented, so that they would vote in the will of elders, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"There were threatened that... the State institutions had closed the eyes of such behavior because of excessive sensitivity, "the correction of the conduct of the belongance and religion".
Syr Eric; 50 Recommendations on the cleaning of the system, including the elimination of political activists from the work with the voting bulletins to stop "the voting collection of votes".
The report, on the basis of Teresa May, also calls for eligible checks in the registration to prevent the use of the box of electors for immigration and privileges.
It is considered to require the voters to submit the certificate of the person before voting.
And use unsmiled breasts on the fingers of people as soon as they leave their bulletin to interrupt anybody to vote twice.
To carry out systematic checks of people's nationality in order to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year request for automatic vote.
Removing political participants of campaigns and activists from the work with the full votes and conversions with a close vote.
The police shall be able to establish the borders around the election parts.
Amendment of the law to facilitate the statement of accusations in the Representation of the National Act of 1983.
Make illegal graphics on the selected parts.
Require that only English is in the elections (excluding Wales).
Enhance training to ensure that the staff makes the voters go to the building.
Sir Eric is appealing to the city area, stateing that it is "appealable" that no voting accusations have been issued after Tauer-Hamlets.
"Sud who considers the issues of elections, the discвалифицирer of Lutfur Rachman and his agent for a long review of corruption and illegal holdings," he reported.
He was recognized as a guilty of a fundamental doubt — a criminal standard of evidence — by a number of commitments.
He also criticizes the unreported "country tests" of the selective registration of cities' administrations.
Sir Eric stated, "The last year of the court in Tauer-Hamletse was a signal to wake up.
Our nation has a fierce heritage as a mother of Parliamental elections, yet anxious and hidden distribution of electoral powers and with rejecting certain authorities of threat to this good reputation.
Consequently, the Cate's bicycle analogue and other Olympiades' names in Rio
The Olympy Phanates 2016 in Rio this week, with the French bicycle of Polin Ferran-Prevo, which appeared to be impressively like Cambridge Hercegin.
But the 24-year Olympia's player is not far the only sportsman that fights for gold this year, which can be excited by his own famous dual, at least by the reports in the society.
In the honor of the Game Rio and all the famous persons, FEMAIL presents on our screens at the current time, with a list of olympics with more than the overall comparison with Hollywood stars.

And actually, the lady learned about the foolishness of the society and admitted that he heard that he looked like Leo from the pounds he was a kid.
"I don't see personally a big equality, may be exceptional to face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons in London in 2012 will certainly indicate more in this year: a vulnerable comparison between the British Greg Deserford and the population of Nilo Patrick Harris.
The Russian guest Alia Mustafin, with its large expressive eyes, as they say, is a exact copy of the Cuban-American Gloria's song.
And in the South African basin Cameron Van der Burga, the Star of Hora Matthew Morrisson has been compared to Cameron Van der Burg for years.
Going to the most unexpected: This user believes Nathan is a "sporting version" of the "Ana" actor.
Another continuing comparison was between the tennisist Rafael Nadar and the actor of JIA Harnett, which could be severely severe by the weight and mouth.
A silver medalist from Russia Julia Ethiopia may not only be a foolish skin and light hair like Annalin's actor Cord, while Nathan Adrian from the United States team, according to the fanates, like the "sporting version of Joseph Gorgon Levit".
Hard Women: The star of Hoop Solo, left, and the actor Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same forms and eyes

Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason that is based on the appearance of this couple
One user of Twitter has recently turned to the website to find out his attention that "the local Internet thinks that Hoop Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
In fact, the U.S. football stars and Dextera actrices have an incredible form and eyes.
Other comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her laughing that is close to the identical dream of Larry Linny actrice, as well as the winning of the golden medal of Gabbie Duglas, which could be awesome with its own beautiful laughing, like the laughing of the "Good Success" star, Gabriel Youneon.

She's too relaxed, started like her, died as a wheat.
Thank you for this.

The criticism in the Twi'ere was appealed to Bayron's Donald, so many invited him to leave him
Twitter's officers have not been held when they heard what Birron's insensitive was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Nothing to himself #Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canadian and make us like a racist kitchen. #disgusted.
In the next time, Scott Russell, who led the CBC transfer, apologized in the direct efficiency for the comments of the Donald, saying, "We ask for excuses for the fact that the comments on the conduct of the floating statement falled in the hepher."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry that it happened.
The SSF has concluded that they have been apologized before more than 90 people who have responded to this statement
A friend of the commenter Scott Russell had to be apologized by Âdonald
CBC then scrolled and sent their excuses to more than 90 other Twitter users who were deceived on the commentary of Donald
The teleset also made it possible to apologize and repeat the statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they had allowed them to go out to Ether.
Yesterday we are operating to apologize to our viewers in the direct ephere and our signatures in the society.
In the clearness, the comments of Bayron were made to express a pneumatic, not as a person.
Yet, this was an inappropriate and unfair choice of words, and Bairon was very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday, he was apologizing in the right ephere and tried to clarify his comments, saying that he was not that his words were expressed as an attack on the person.
'I would like to use a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the woman', he said on the translation of the Olympics games on the CBC.'
'I spoke about the expression of a pneumatic, not of it personally.'
"It's only happening that there was no unrespect, and I'm very sorry."
Building Primark on a woman, which was increasingly illustrating the lower white in the middle of the store
The purchasers didn't know where to view when a woman had been able to illustrate tricks at the middle of Primark stores.
What even worse, she illustrated how she looked in them, cut them down and put them back on the ground.
She continued to search, and then she had four pairs of below white in the Bouverie Place marketing center in Falkstone.
Magazine Primark of Bouverie Place in Falkstone, where a woman illustrated triangle triangle before putting them back on the ground
The mother of the two children of Jenny Davidson, who was at that time in the bathroom, said that after the example of the below white, a mysterious woman was "made again and went out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe in what they saw."
When she stood in the middle of the trade room, she took a couple of bullets from the vitrine, took her own cups and throats and made them.
"He didn't try to find somewhere a cool place to do it -- she just stood there, wasn't it."
"All of them arose when she dropped the trumpets again, and they didn't like her, because she set them back on the roof."
She did the same with three other couples before she decided that there was nothing that she would like, she had clothed and went out.
"It doesn't seem to have forgotten her who watched her, or that she thought about a man who would finally buy those trees that she had illustrated."
The 33-year Jenny Davidson, from Kent, said, "What contrary is it to think that someone's going to take a busy house that someone else had already been wearing, and they were not cut off."
The event occurred on Thursday.
Davidson added, "I do conclude that the staff, of course, was trying to remove these objects of clothes from the sale after she went away, and it was better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new couple of females and find out that the other woman had taken and cut them out, and they were not cut off."
Primark's representative reported, "Primark knows what happened in our store in Falkstone on Thursday 9 August."
All of the goods about which and to which they were sold were excluded from the sale.
How to protect yourself from attacks with a gun using craw-mach
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this is a video from Dailymail.com, maybe help you to make it a little more safe.
We talked with Ron Mizrachi, the Master of the Craw-Make Federation in New York, to find out how to cope with armed engravers closely.
If they come to you in front or behind, this video will show you how to kill the buritor of his weapons.
If they come back, according to Mizrachi, the first thing you have to do is to turn out so that you see the attacker and 'free the fire line'.
Then you make the gun strong between your face and your arrow before you hit them into a free lock.
Then the tribe is in the cup, and until the attacker is lost from the pain, you throw the gun out of his hands, shoot it in the face of the gun, and go back, hold the weapons on it.
For the inflammated, appropriate way of doing the like, take your body out of the fire line, quickly put the gun out and throw it out so that the wicked can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and shoot the ass in the wheel, then cut the gun out of his cap, before you get back and heal it.
Sounds complicated?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does.
But remember that the safeest outcome from any shot -- if you're not a craw-master, it's to give your own.
For the traveller, Ian Rayt performs his tongue in the most dangerous places
The British traveler underlined his immune system and a severe reflexion, lifting some of the most vulnerable and distorted in the Property.
The leader and author of the Ian Rayt travel books, 51, from Saffolk, conducted the banknote language, the circus Pikkadili perils, the unity's buttons on the road and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of its immune system.
Before each object was running, he split luminometer to show himself and us what he enters.
But the experiment that must be a movie called "Ru Traveller-Lisune on Internal Sile" -- some wonderful results.
The idea of swimming the crash button in the eating that thousands of others use may be extremely disgusting, but actually, the bader bacteria in the kitchen cancer is worse.
During the whole street, Rayt spoke to doctors and mediums about the increase of the bacteria and its own health.
Happily, nothing of the obliquid has brought him more than a bad bowl in his mouth.
Rayth is grateful for the trials of his wallet, traveling through the world and eating strange and strange things.
From public perils on the boxes to the unity's mixture button, this task, probably, was the immune system
In the movie that he took, he said, "I was perfectly unleavened to my health, and I made many different things in the mouth of the earth, eating red and swimming water."
Of course, he proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused is a cruel Russian public toilet.
His test brain demonstrates the value of a luminometer exceeding 4000 units.
For comparison: just the hands cut out must be in the range 60.
But there was a Russian public toilet that he refused to lift, after the importance of his luminometer was more than 4000 units, while the hands were cut off by less than 60.
The Rayt and the finish manufacturer of milk products, Valio, filmed a traveler named "Ru's Traveller-Lisune on the Internal Sile", which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet
In the movie he said, 'This is near one of the worst things I had cut in the toilet.'
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not going to stumble anything because it's amazing.
"Ru's Traveller-Lisuna's Internal Sile" was collected together with the financial manufacturer of milk products of Valio.
The company is ahead of Ritu Valio Gefilus, containing oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to contribute to the growth of human bacteria and to develop the immune system.
The elder Vice-President Valio on sucks, socks and new categories of Niko Worenmaa said, "We really wanted to offer a new thing to the consumers.
What would be interested in seeing and at the same time could explain the benefit of the probiotics.
We had a brain sturm that ended with the idea "Let's call Jan."
They claim that the interest in the health of the wallet becomes a global manifestation
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to place them in a large context: good and bad bacteria in our entire environment, the importance of the wallet health and how it was with the immune system.
Increasing interest in the health of the clipboard is a global manifestation, and by means of this document, we have made more information to the consumers in the interesting form.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good feeling of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was a register of the film, added: "Let's say that I would lose respect for Jan if he had broken some of the things I asked, for example, a disgusting Russian toilet that was shown in the film."
Of course, some of the things of Jan was easier to go through, and some were quite violent.
I'm glad that some of these liabilities have been able to get in prison.
In the 2015 Valio, 84 per cent of the oxygen bacteria were sold exclusively with a good cow and box, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes products containing added oxygen bacteria.
The family of Huligan was Saltash, the Municipal House of Cornuol, for the exhibition
The Huligan families left their municipal house with 50,000 pounds, after they were excited for the fear of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shawn Trobilkok were thrust out of their object of inmobility in Saltash, Cornual, after a long deal against them.
After they had been strictly removed from the object of immobility, the shocked workers of the building partners discovered this object of inevitability in the condition required for reconstruction.
The walls were left with winters, halfs were hidden, the walls were split and the walls were cut off.
Family is now moved and it is likely to live in a private apartment
Donna, a dealer in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid not to save him.
She said, 'This was a absolute cosmar for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things that need to be emphasized because this object of inmobility is probably not very good but Cornual.
This family uses foolish glory, and their name is used by foolish glory.
Parents of three sons who lived in the area of insurance from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of a terrible family called included drags on the street with baseball bits, fear of the neighbouring areas, drug use, drug trade, excessive crying, disturbance and injury.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the arending contract, received an antisocial behaviour in June.
In a number of horns of houses that may be brought up to an old mushroom
The sex tables in the house in which drugs were sold in the past
The neighbors say they saw drags on the street and regularly called the field
Cornwall Housing was promptly released from her home and her partner this week after they had been granted a long period of 11 weeks for voluntary department.
It was easy to welcome neighbors who said that their lives were transformed into a real hail.
One said, "They weren't worrying."
We lived near them 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times when we've seen the field here, it's incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We rose up because it was so quiet here, we didn't usually.
Now when they've finally gone, it's gonna be.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the owner of the group for the neighborhood of Cornwall Housing, said that the family was not able to cooperate with the authorities.
Family lived in the house of 20 years, with half-year-old, and to that, they were called for half-year-old
The Museum and old games were released below the adult side of the Municipal House
He added, 'This is a shame that the advertisers could not accept any responsibility for her and her family's behavior, since the exhibition is always the last method of the Cornwall Housing.
It was a very complicated case, since the conduct was limited, and their actions must have been terrible for her neighbors.
I appreciate all my team, police and members of the community of Devon and Cornual, who were courageous to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a little comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that social behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house for a different time, but he said that they had a little more than twenty.
A horrible matrace stayed on the ground in one of the burned houses after the apartment
The workers of the division will now have to remove the tissue that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police made a search in the house and found more than 70 g of conoples, as well as the vessels corresponding to accessories and 1700 £.
Scheldon was →trafowed after he recognized himself to be guilty of drugs in class B.
She stated that the money was paying for her son, Le Skeldon, who died in the car of a disaster in 2013.
After making them homeless, there are information that Tanya and her partner will now be in Plymote.
The walls of many rounds of the house were packed over the surface.
Police says that they will strive to cross the farmers that are not subject to the rules of residence arrangement
Angela Craw, from Devon and Cornual police, stated that this population had sent clear warning to others who continue to violate rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can be guided without the accusation of the accusator and those who have such conduct,' she said.
The criminal and antisocial behavior will never be allowed by Devon and Cornual, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Turists in Portugal came to a terrible time when the running military airplane was not cut off the floor
In the city of Ayer in Portugal, the tourists who worshiped the sunrise feared their lives
Aeroplane P-3C Orion military-air forces Portuguese passed incrediblely low
Military air forces reported that he was running a train aircraft, but insisted on the lack of safety risks.
This is the moment when feared tourists begin to panic, while the downground airplane is over the overflow floor.
On dramatic frames, a military aircraft has been seen that is almost flying at the distance of cashanians from the pool of the fish in Ayero, northern Portugal.
Respirators shouted on their feet as soon as they became understood because they were concerned about your aircraft motors, but they had no possibility to see that it moves through the cloud.
The incident occurred yesterday evening nearby the city of Ayera in Costa-Nova.
Daniel Fernando, one of the several relaxants, who opened the video shocking in the networks, said, "He passed very lowly twice, and there was a moment, at some time it was seen that he would be divorced."
Nono Arroja added, "I was a serfining and I swear, there was a feeling that the flight is going to fall on me."
The tourists on the beach of Ayera were terriblely scared when the flight was shown out of the tunnel and passed to the extremely low height
The military air forces of Portugal today stated that the P-3C Orion airport pilot had carried out a train aircraft to find fishing vessels at Âg, and it had to be so low, since it was the only way to check them.
Pilot stated that the airplane was a little lower than usually because of the insufficient visibility of the smoke from the nearby burning forests, but military air forces claimed that no one had been in danger.
In this year, forest fires have caused the material part of Portugal, and four people have lived on the island of Madeira.
The military air forces of Portugal have made today a statement that the pilot had to fly so lowly in the power of the circumstances — a dust tuban and a smoke from the forest fires that had decreased the visibility
The plane was running a train flight, and the pilot was ordered to find fishing vessels in the task
The HAS's system has been committed for society for more than a year, but most of the coffee and restaurants of Peterburg have not introduced it until this.
The tests become active, and the business is threatened to 1 million robbery.
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, Russian HAS) - an analysis of risks and critical control points - is obligated to apply producers and food carriers, as well as companies in Russia's community, as a member of the Thamogen Union (TS).
Business checks by the Rose-Nassour in accordance with these standards in Petterburg began in February 2015.
However, until the factors write the crafts only from where the regulation is supplied (see "Document Reviews"...).
The non-compliance of the regulation will generally contribute to 600 billion rubles for the first injury and 1 million rubbles for the second.
HAS > as a system that takes into account the risk of food products and prevents them in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about the safety of food for astronauts.
The system is now used for all food businesses not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the Union.
Since February 2015, the HAS operates in the TS territory.
The business system was 4 years on the time and introduction (HAS need was in 2011 in the TS technology).
However, the companies themselves and the factors recognize that most companies have not even heard of this standard.
Unfortunately, we were long convinced that the standard is covered only for food products, not for restaurants, - explained the Chapter of the Common Council of Elena's Church.
Now they're all trying to overcome what's lost.
The expected time for renewal of charter travel in Turkey is the end of August - beginning of September.
But they won't call an aggressive question, because their target auditorium is a family with children is already ready to school, but they notice experts.
Allians of tourist agencies have sent a letter to the Government with a request to authorize the agencies now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of the selection of quality and accessible marine rest is unresolvable, since most of the areas of the Crossland and the Republication of Crime have already been forbidden until September," commented the writers and stressed that the opening of charter transports in August does not affect the already complicated question on the Russian tourist.
As reported in the North-West Regional Deployment of the Russian Turindustrial Union (RST), where the airports of Russia and Turkey are quickly agreed, the renewal of the cartridge to Turkey can be expected for a month.
A clear understanding, when charters are renewed until no, it depends first of the aircraft authorities.
Technically, aircrafts may fly in September, even August, if tour operators operatively build programmes and agree with aircraft firms needed for the bars," says Paul Rumannezv, the director of communications and projects of the Northwest Regional Agency.
He said that the potential renewal of charters is a good news, but it does not affect the marketing of forces, because the main cartridge purchasers - family with children - have already returned from relaxation and are ready to school or have been released in other countries.
At the barchat season, the purchase of tour is mainly single travelers and couples.
The programmes may be calculated on those who have the opportunity to repair spontaneously," says Paul Romancev.
"Turkey has a chance for many tourists, if she now gives a very budgetary proposal - 50-60 thousand tour tours at two, because there are people who are rightly waiting for very deep tours," says Valeria Rosental, the general tourist of Optio-Travel.
In other cases, not exactly worth calculating age, the basic mass of travels is already planned.
Paul also believes that, since there is a question to Turkey, the charters will also be disappointed, but it is not worth waiting.
"For Turkey, the design of charters is now a reception of the season," says Paul Romancev.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is a news for the season," was Valerie Rubtz.

According to the regulator's report, the ACB ' AGROYBANK ' conducted a highly risked credit policy with the placing of money in low quality assets.
The appropriate risks to be taken by the supervisory body and a valid reflection of the value of the bank's assets have led to the credit organisation for measures to warn bankroad.

The London school, which joined IGIL, died in Syria
Cadisa Sultan, one of the three British schools who left London last year to join IGIL, as reported, died in Syria.
The Lawyer Tasni Akungji stated that her family knew her death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is supposed to have died from the Russian aircraft in Rakka, the grouping flags in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
Sultane was 17 years old, and, according to her family, she died as soon as the plan was to leave the devastated war of the country and return to England.

In February 2015, Sultan and two other schools from Eastern London were aeroplanes to Turkey and then to the bus to the Syrian border.
The seven Sultans said that she had married the IHIL fighter in Syria and became a widow during several months.

He praised Harland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't "scake a ship" with a new choice.
Harland is the Chief Court of the United States of Appeal Court on Columbia.
Rid stated that the resorts who block the name of Harland are "courage" and "P" of the republic candidate at the President of Donald Trompa.
He said Trump was not suitable for the job.
Treats states that erotic calendars for ' women, as well as for men '
The Traats journal works with David Bellmer's graph to release a calendar in the light of 2017 inspired by Pirelli in 1970s.
Instead of finding designs, they are intended to find a better generation of top models for their calendar for 2017 with muscles discovered.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us this year earlier that his magazine with a large number of models is different from old-mode Playboy, because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing it for women.
Of course, he thinks the calendar too.
"We need to return to the demonstration of the eternal and the class of the discovered figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these women's body," said Shaw in the press-religious statement of the calendar.
Women will be a part of this project because it is a result of experience.
Models can provide online graphs or personally on open coasts in Los Angeles and New York.

It was reported earlier that Ernst Neʹgo's families planned to conduct a panic in New York, probably until 14 August.
The final consumer wounded: Who actually buying plastics?
Only men of the middle-years love faults.
And until you have stopped to delay the section of the commentarys with the puzzles of the Nevisoodic Museum of the Middle Leet, that has been running out of the actual data.
According to YouGov, the so much-debated recovery of the plastic is not a bomb among the two-house generations that want to be a new material item, but a middle-year-old natalgy.
Those who have recently purchased a vine album (c) a large part of the probability of age from 45 to 54, are given.
Besides, those who belong to a 18-24-year-old group are less likely.
This is also not just the act of the assembly of lovers - it has a emotional importance: the higher buyers have committed more likely to have their feelings (56 per cent against 53 per cent) and enjoy a singleness (69 per cent against 66 per cent).
But do I have the results of YouGov faithful?
If this blog was a television news reporter, the camera would follow me until I'd go to the centre of the Soho's survived street, in a low-cost-search and widely gesticulated before the rest, holding hands and saying something increasingly, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly divorced by his disappointment and grass — hotels, coffee, carriers of Paperchase are now filled with convictions, some of the independent sellers have still been held.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the scene in which I am close to different people in some of these magazines and try to evaluate their age and emotional attitude by monitoring.
Glasgo Stuart, 55 years after which I went from Sister Ray (consuming data: two young women, three middle-year men) to Reckless Records (consuming data: eight men of average years, one woman probably over 20 years) in London to take a meeting, and goes through the stores to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I'm asking?
"I guess yes," he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 plastics.
These plates that are pictured above (he sent me on the e-mail photos, I didn't follow him home) go on the walls of his guest.
His reason to obtain such a large number of albums and singings is to be part of its available income: he can now buy a plastic that he could not allow himself when they were just out, and solve the items he sold when he was young and on the mile.
"Most of what I get is the end of the 60th, the beginning of the 70th, the things that came out when I had 11 or 12 things for which I probably was too young to buy," he says.
He is that those who buy plastics are most likely the introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't fuck, I don't drink very much.
That's my lack.
Weez, 25 years of work at Sister Ray, also believes that many clients he meets correspond to YouGov's profile.
He noted, however, a new whale of people under the impact of the SME, people who heard the return and feelings of the obligation to purchase their old plastics.
As I had, people have been released from their collection, as usually in 1998 or 1999.
The clients who have ever sold their fault to buy computers are now selling their compact disks to buy their plates," he says.
This may explain the bump between the regeneration factors of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plastic?
It is enough to take a few seconds in the store, such as Phonica, to understand that the plastic stores are a comfortable community of people with similar views.
According to Wess, some older clients, in particular, are involved in an independent payment system.
The lovers of the guilty may feel disappointed from the digital peace and prefer to be removed in the steadfastly known conversions for the plastic, the objects that rise to the memories of the unnecessary youth.
"I think it may sometimes be the fill of an empty or an area with material things as its kind of peace," says Weez.
Because I'm a collector, I have it, and I think many people have too.
It's a simple way to take your own.
"We are their staff!", said a colleague from the staple of the plaster.
The ICM question in April showed that almost 50 per cent of people who purchased a vine album last month had not yet listened to it.
The investigation also discovered that 41 per cent of the players they have never used, while 7 per cent of those who buy wines have no plastic player.
At that stage of the news report, I would probably look to be seriously endeavored and proliferated with the congregations of Bosnia.
The "Troffein" and the birth is what Johnny noted, 42 years old, who works in Sounds of the Universe.
"Nobody came recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a radiohead plastic so that we can put it up to myself," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it's definitely happening.
More composing products, less than.
We have people who say, "I don't have a player."
They're younger, not older, some less than twenty, who's just familiar with it.
Fopp, who now has taken almost all the vineyards, is a much more different auditor when I come.
There are couples who have 70 tourists who are graphing, boys and women of the middle-years.
Although the atmosphere is less unnecessary than in the above stores is the last synth of Wild Beast, not the jazz improvization, it is pleasant to see diversity in its clients.
No one looks especially alone, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish 30 seconds next to someone.
Electroner, 27 years old, was a few minutes on Fopp, considering the different plastics in the sale.
She's looking at goods, not to lose money.
She doesn't work much, according to her words, so collecting plastics is not very suitable.
It's worth it.
Making a computer or another device is simply, but the beauty is...," it's threatened with an insult, overflowed love.
I don't know how to explain it's really unrepentant.
After the rest of me, it's a magazine that, as they say, contributed to the presentation of a new generation of lovers, guilty of the city models.
As long as I create an illusion that I consider gine's obliged shirts, I watch for a group of girls, each minute I'll gather around the Polaroid camera before the father and his daughter will start discussing the purchase of Crosley player.
The left is a wall placed by Adel, Jeff Bacley, Amy Waynewood and Flitwood Mc: a mixture of modern style and classic, a mixture of plastics for any average collection.
No one looks at — perhaps because they are simply a curse, some are so high on the wall that it would not be able to touch them.
It's a real "soft wine".
However, taking into account any attention to these items may mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho depth for a while, it is almost no matter what to complain.
It is not surprised that the layer of a population with greater probability than most of them has more time and money than most of them is the layer that loses the majority of money on the subjects of the rocks, such as the wine.
But while my conclusions testify that YouGov's results are exactly, at least in the Soho plastic stores, they do not exclude a large number of women-collectioners and lovers of vine that actually are in the plastic stores and on the online forums.
These people probably work at school or offices.
But they don't appear to be held on Thursday morning by walking on the bars on Bervic Street's plates, and avoiding the views of an inappropriate 30-year-old fake leader, which depends on the beaches of no doubting men of the middle-years.
Greenland’s accumulation — the longest lived animal — a video report
Scientists state that the Greenland Aquale has the largest duration of life from all the nights on the planet.
Julius Nilesen, who studies these accumules, states that the record has set a master of 272 to 512 years of age and a length of five metres
The French Court rejects the proposal to bring the store in the Jungley refugee camp
The French Court rejected the proposal of Calle's authorities to bring tens of single stores and restaurants in the Jungley camp, where thousands of refugees are.
At the audiences of this week, Calle stated that the State should be able to bring 72 single stores where people inside the camp sold goods, from cigarette to energy drinks, split or sell the tea for 50 cents (40 euros) or the highest guard of several of the same restaurants.
Calle prefecture stated that these places should be removed because they are a parallel economy that does not make taxes, and because they have fire and health risks.
The humanitarian groups reported to the court that the stores and restaurants are living by saying that free stocks, pro-governmental associations and other groups, do not provide enough food for the number of foods in the camp.
They said that there is a place where the stores and restaurants are often providing blood and free food to those who need it.
The Court of Justice claimed that there was no legal mandate to evacuate 72 individuals, but said that Cale's prefecture problems were "comprehensible".

British remains in regby-7, after the Master-Class Fidge allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Britain in Regby-7 was instantly stopped on the final interruption by Fidge team on Thursday evening when they were completely disappointed 43-7 at the Deidoro stadium here in Rio.
Fidge gave a master-class for the owner of the sword, the repository, the remote, the support of the game, the escape of lines and the gross force to win the gold — their first olympical medal of any color.
The damage came too poor comfort in the form of silver — the third in Britain per day — and they could be encouraging their efforts in the first Olympics tourist on Regby-7 in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and Southern.
Boks painful killing, 7-5 in half-final earlier on the same day, could return to say negatively on them in the final.
But unless anyway, Fidge won the best team of 15 people in such a way.
This may be some comfort for the United Kingdom, but it is probably not that at least one britannian will take the golden medal tomorrow: the main trainer of Fiji Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a few travels for the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost each game on Adelaide Sevens.
There they lost only one.
These attacks will cause pain, but the progress is racious.
Fidge started greatly, for a pleasure, refusing British trials to catch the fat.
It was like to touch the bus moved for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the world series came up to 5-0 when Osea Collinsau was cut down to the angle.
He had four minutes in the hours of Jerryr Tuwai added another tachdaun on the right float that was disappointed.
12-0 and British food touched the sword.
The great trial for Mitchell's capture was holding a man of Leon's Mountain to kill the third, but it just stopped Fidge.
At the seventh minute, Jas Vermalua made a tachdaun in the right angle, and the United Kingdom was playing 17-0.
Another added after the renewal, and there were more minutes at the first half of the hours.
The Vatemo Ravovo then was broken through a few more big efforts to take the britain's capture, and he took a line to get a point.
Realisation led to 29-0 in a break.
It seemed like Fidge had been born for the regby-7 games while the United Kingdom still possessed a remess.
That's a significant degree.
Greece made massive replacements for half of the game, and they bought the Fiji Dambus... for every four minutes that was good at the first half standards until Joshua Tuisov passed after several flat figianian interactions.
Dan Norton tried to British by making a tachdaun in the left angle to account 36-7 but the game was long on the island -- the South Sea, whose fanates were sing, washed by flags and danced on tribes.
It couldn't be fully rejoiced by Fiji's approach.
The mother of William has cut off the Fijian Tor, which was not needed to train, another trial in the last seconds.
Sounding a swimming, Fidjians were covered, and the Great Britain fell on the gazon, fullly winned.
At the same day, Fidge won Japan 20-5 in their half-final, and the United Kingdom had a little south in the pressed half-final attempt to everyone — the difference of the British Issue.
Kyle Brown's going on Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton's helped a great work, he cut a line and killed the balls in the second half.
The 15th brother of the England team, Anthony, was able to gain the winning — and finally counted silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hisser Stanning were inspired to win a cruel struggle with cancer
It won't be more interesting gold on these games, and it's about something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 weak sums in history, Helen Glover and Hesser Stanning found an additional importance of their golden moment at Stacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two who drew wheat, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was always until they tried to the second underground of Olympian gold in women's couples, the first women in the British Annals that reached such a height.
Their overcome was absolutely, at the end, their 39th unexpected statement was again unprecedented.
What we see is that two flashing sports that covers the surface with electedness of the lebeth are not completely reflecting the nature of the triumph.
Following each golden grape, the battle of hands prepared for gradually growing wins that have a importance, and no hands that were more important than the trainer's hands, which had been diagnosed 30 months ago, didn't know whether he would live before seeing this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had the cancer of a muscle puzzle, which is one of what they could operate, and they did it.
If they don't do that, he's all over there.
It could be a lot of bad situation.
She's changing your looks for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was happy that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, keeping the graphic breakfast at least if it could be a right expression in such circumstances as these.
I needed a payment, so I needed to go quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and played 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet per time, although they spoke enough several steps.
That's how it starts.
It's a travel, but it makes it a little more.
At a time after their winning, the first thoughts were about Williams, who had been nervous at the morning, talking almost more than usually, in trying to overcome their own concerns.
Stanning, Captain of Artileria, with the service in Afghanistan, said, "I've been emotionally disrupted this week, maybe it's a little cherry, but that's so much."
It just confirms how much it means for me how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
These were three years of statistics with Helen and Robin.
With Robin we would be nobody, so thank him greatly, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner for training or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hisser Stanning haven't lost any track in five years.
This couple provides a stressed ritme that their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 meters when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to reach, Stanning and Glover had too much reserve.
We were very in the phase.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's not important now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something like it.
We didn't wait for the feathers today, we just waited for a good wound and to get out and win the gate that we did.
Pairs will need a year to decide their future.
The Chairman must be married for a month, at her own TV caller, Steve Beckshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't want to say that it was myself after I'd gone.
That would mean too much pressure.
I needed about six months in London to realize that I was a Olympian campaign.
It was all so new, and I was so pressured.
I needed about four minutes here.
I feel so much better," she said.

How Bangkok said in the emergency situation
In January 2014, the Government of Thailand and the Prime Minister of Yinglak Chinavat announced the introduction of an emergency situation in Bangkok and the staff of provinces.
The special regime has spent 60 days.
As in Bangkok, two explosions were over.
In January 2014, in Bangkok's centre, at the Vienna Monument, where one of the main protests had been carried out, two explosions were made, due to 28 persons, and five of them were in critical state.
Infections have not been produced on the moto.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and attached military forces to protect demons.
In Such Loge, a time began.
As "E", the Government was proposed to make a project of an auction on the golden round of the Suhai Log with the preservation of two key initiatives.
There is no allowance for companies where 25% and more belong to foreigners, and those who will not have at least 25% of the capital of the host.
Adults do not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players do not risk taking place for a complex and delightful project.
Actions can be declared in August and conducted in October.
Min Nature has introduced the Government a draft distribution and aid to the largest urban golden residence in Suhai Log (Irkut area, stocks and resources of 130 million units), two sources of " U", known as the situation.
The project has been introduced in the middle of the evening, and one of them is accurate.
In Min Nature, "E" confirmed that the project was introduced to the Government.
The representative of the curriculum nedro-premier vicepresident Alexander Cloponina said "E" that the project has not yet been done in the composer's equipment.
"Auction may be declared already in August, while after the outcome of the Government ' s discharge, and taking into account the time for the collection of potential participants (not less than 45 days) the tender may be already in October," says Minn Nature.
According to the " E", the project maintained two key requirements for the potential parties listed in the alternative, which was sent to the Ministries and the FOVs in July (eat "U").
The first is the presentation of the representative capital at least 25% of the ladies.
The second is the refusal of access to accommodation for companies under control of foreign investors, resulting from the understanding of FZ-57 of investment in the public.
According to the two articles set out in the draft FS, as he already wrote on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of the above) are not taxed by RF residents or have double citizenship.
The Government is able to introduce such initiatives, since Suchay Log is to the nedrome of the federal value (countries exceeding 50 tonnes of gold).
Min Nature confirmed that the draft " will be maintained for the investigation of foreign companies", but they refused to comment the details before the Government was distributed.
The request for hospitality in the capital of aid participants was held by the Irkutian area, called "E" in Min Natura in December 2015 and confirmed later the Governor of the Region of Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was addressed to Min Natura, his former Sergei Eroshonko, "the investment project agreement with "Rusheh".
Who's a lobby foreigners' visits, the "E" meetings are not accurate.
"But this is in the spirit of the time: no control in the largest place of gold in Russia on the west sanction background," considers the "E", known as the preparation of auktions.
The Chapter of Min Nature Sergei Donny, 1 August, stated that foreigners " could go to consorcium" if the tenderers would attach them "as a financial structure, technology partners".
The "E" meetings believe that the Government is not likely to rectify the conditions.
The Basic Representative on Suhai Log in adults considers the consorcium of the greatest golden cotton RF PAO Polos, the sub-control son of Sule, Carimova Saida, and Roseha.
As the "E" wrote in July, the partners created "LL Gold", where "Polus" is 51 per cent below, and the "Rusheha" structure of RT-GR is 49 per cent.
"Rostache" refused the comments, "Poluse" stated "E" that "inclusively interested in this activity" and the powers of all its competences and resources for its development.
"The decision on the possibility and form of our participation will be taken after the declaration," added the "Poluse".
ALROSA can participate in the auction, but the RF Government's decision, the sources of "E".
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, who developed assets on Chuckoca, stated that Polymetal and Norgold were not interested in the active.
The Chapter of the Union of Golden Industries RF Sergei Kashuba in December 2015 has invested "E" in Suhay Log in $2,5-4 billion.
Most potential candidates fear not only the amount of investment but also the complexity of the project: a serious investigation of stocks and technologies with complex rounds, explaining "E" partners in adults.
On the Pension Market, the major M&A, "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" has launched the process of jointing four subcontrol NPFs.
As a result, the Gasfund of Pensions will be created by NPF with a total of approximately 373 billion rubs.
The procedure for the establishment of the four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Pro-Fond", "Ereficiency" and "Gasfund of Pensions" - reported the owner of 100% of the OO "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" last night.
"Organization is on the management of the CB in accordance with the requirement of insufficient contracts," states the company's report.
The Deliveration is held on the Gasfund of Pensions.
As indicated by the NPF Oleg Bielorusk, the funds are allowed to resolve several tasks: extension of the presence geography, promotion of resources for development, reduction of expenditure, highlighting the best of the funds and optimization of the corporate management.
According to his statement, the rational time for the end of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result, the NPF "Gasfund Pensions" will be the most important player in the OPS market.
According to that on 31 March, the amount of pensions of funds exceeded 373 billion rubs.
As reported on the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner, the KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently being Anatolio Gavrilenko (with the subcontact of OOO 65%) and the NPF "Gasfund" (35%).
However, only the group's association has launched a lot more late competitors.
Yes, the O1 NPF subcontrol group of the "Buying" has enhanced the Stallfund still at the beginning of the current year.
Currently, this united NPF presents Uralcib and Russian standards.
"Association in a single structure, in addition to reduction of extent necessary to resolve structural tasks," notes the NPF "Budding" Nicolai Sidorov.
The active work on the consolidation of funds from April and Abril and in the Pension Group of Safmar - NPF " Ev'aiski", "Education and Science" and "Regionfonds" must be involved in the NPF "Safmar" until the end of the year.
The NPF will be joined by them in 2017.
"Financing funds will strengthen risk control, operational processes and expenditures," stated the Pension Group of Safmar.
The pause in the funds associated with the "KIT Finance Administrator of Pension" may be made for several reasons, indicating experts.
In recent times, the NPF could not solve more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure issue of the commitments in which the group was actively located.
After amendments to the setting of the BC in March of this year on a number of emissions corresponding to the requirements of the regulator, there is no more.
If necessary, the whole exhibition can be solved by one major player," indicates the ACRA Jury Nogin group of financial institutions.
A number of NPF operators from top-15 for assets are called for another reason for breakdown, and, as a result, the framework assignments in one fund that the owners of the group had to be held.
Anatolius Gavrilenko was not available for comments yesterday.
"E" in the NPF "Gasfund" was also not answered.
Although the consolidation of funds is working and unemployment, the decision will be justified at a long distance.
As mentioned by the Consulting Company Director Sergey Ocolasnov, the Gusfund of Pensions is lower, the association will allow the basis of other funds to stabilize.
In this context, the NPF will have a more successful experience in building different OPS sales and the use of more modern OCS.
The CB needs for processes and NPF frameworks will continue to duplicate the infrastructure in four funds in one investment policy, therefore the Director for Corporative Reviews of "Expert RA" Paul Mitrosov.
"The effect of decreasing duplicate functions will uniformly overcome the →combination expenditures," notes Mr. Mitro's.
The debt for the four funds of Sergei Ocolasnov is estimated by 30-50 million rubs.
"The costs for four funds of such sizes are about 400 million rubs per year, when consolidated in the middle-term budget to actually decrease two," said Mr. Ocolasnow.
The Russian procate was the best design cinema "Pet and his dragon".
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the artificial dragon, the mental story and the song in the style of the cantry are sufficient to believe in the old-moded §, ELENA KRAVCUN.
The fearful boy chose the dragon that sets the childhood and the neighborhood and the loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, honestly a shot from the story book, plays with him in a shot and sleeps in a picture.
Six years after he was grown, and in a severe relationship, no longer distinguished from the other thoughtful forest boss - Maugle.
In such a way, Pita discovers the Rose-Egery Grace, Brice Dallas Howard, while the Brigade Gavine (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively worth the forest.
Now she must not only believe in the dracon's discipline, but also help him to save him.
Pete is in the course of being a man in the area of idolatry Americans who carry out cowboys, the moral code in the heart, and are laughing more blind than any advertising.
No person looks like or doesn't act too terrifying that the looker actually begins to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who opened his own own inhabitants of the forests, is far to an unfair misfortune.
The big smoking dragon has also been completely invisible, with a good bulldog, with a flying wheel and the ability to become invisible.
Dracon is funny, mourning, even craving, and, for happiness, doesn't say, so he's always wanting to hurt, and it's worthly different from all the cinematic dracons.
The visual image of Elliot and his way of maintaining such a high emotional degree in compliance with that at the most stressed moments, they start deceiting in three hands, not only small lookers, but also adults.
Excellently good and little-year Oaks Figgles in the role of Pita, which breaks between the possible family and the true friend.
And Robert Redford has virtually issued a canon of a grandfather who would be pleased to have each child literally.
How did the register David Laurie find out a tastytic record of the forgotten Dracon Pita film, which was average from the nose to the end of the hot and the mix of animation and playing film, and make it the most mental film of this year?
Nothing else the miracle helped.
In his picture of Laurie from the original, in fact, he took only two things: the poverty of Pita and the dragon.
The board remains the number and most of the strange shots.
In this good story, the graphs of "B" and "Inoplane" and many other images are read.
The Disney Study continues to expand the gallery of the 20th century high-quality rounds.
Of course, "Pet and Dracon" is not so excited as the "Jungley Book" and there is no experienced crime that Kate Blanche" is in the role of the cats in the new "Zolushka".
However, this naive movie helps us to believe in wonders and goods in the best design traditions.

The journalist RSK Alexandrru Sokolov has a new accusation
The journalists of RBK Alexander Sokolov, accused of the extremist structure's activities, stated that the prosecution had been unrespected in the case of their sub-defence.
We have learned literally from the investigators that the prosecutor has made such a view.
We had been planned to participate in the court meeting on the knowledge of the matter of voting materials, but it was not yet done, and the investigators reported us about the presentation of the statement of Olgy Dinze," says the RBK.
It races that the prosecutors have an unconformity of the case and collected materials.
The investigators now need to remove spaces in evidence of the basic basis and make Alexander Sokol new accusation.
Or another article of the Country Code (HC) will appear in the case, or will remain the same, but with other evidence and new proofs, Mrs. Dinze states.
As the "E" reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June, it was reported that the consequences were excluded from the accusation of the reporter of RBK's formulation of " the promotion of the political situation in the area of instability" and "the complaint of authorities in the non-legal way".
The Commercent Boscosport Correspondent Alexandre ZILBERT had a life of olympics in the Olympics village, provincies of the Russian congregation house, eating in the chair and even submitting the WADA test.
It doesn't seem to live here for a second.
Even tonight.
The latest starts are completed in the midnight, then the sportsmen need a half-day hour to return to the Olympic village.
Moreover, there is a population and a residence from the village, since some athletes end their exposures and leave Brazil, and some of which, in turn, just come here.
Well, at 7:30 a.m. at one of the temporary tents, the heads of all Olympics delegations are drawn up.
At these meetings we usually discuss some operational issues - reports the role of the delegation of the Olympical Team of Russia Igorj Kazikov. - Despite the house where we believe that it is an exemplary, it has been given to the operation of one of the first and has demonstrated all the checkers, even in it there are some disagreements.
That's with the warm water problem, so I'm sorry, with unnitazas.
We've been a long time for cleanness.
No one just came to go.
Then the clients started to come, but they just cut up with something on the ground, yes.
The fields have, you see, some innovations.
Mol, they're going to be able to go ahead.
Let's know that these fields are normal.
In general, there have been changes in the clinical company, and now it's all OK.
The Olympian village is South Bowtow, the southern area covered by the one side of the mountains, with the other with the inflammable river, with the wallet of water.
Well, for confidentiality, there is still a two-metric rail range of railways to be traveled by the cars.
All in the village can be placed up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments in 31 homes.
On one of the 18-year-old constructions, the Great Russian flag - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our collection.
Looking at a small fooy at the income, it is possible to determine the problems I seem to be the most successful for the father's team.
At the duration of the registration, two statements are: the printing " Please don't leave the paper in the toilet" and the hand "Take in a gift of icons.
It's the same stopping in the buckets.
Their pleasant flower contrasts with the titles of Br.
Text inside in the general hope.
For example, "Inficience is conducted by the throat and the following treatment.
However, not everyone is a pleasant result.
Of course, there is medium in the congregation of Russia, which at any time will be prepared to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the house, including dissatisfiant and positive massage.
Instead of medium, our delegation's own staff.
A people with the door is a inspiring cry, "Although nothing, we will win."
Well, of course, verses:
All arguments are absolutely noble!
They only believe in those who fear.
Let us be less, so we'll be able to get a cup of winning, Russia won't fall away, it's not breaking!
And for a greater exaltion of the spirit, the declaration will be: "Lord brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriot of Moscow and all Russian Cyrilly, the spiritual debt of the Olympics of the Russian College is about the Protector of Andrew Vladimirovich Alexander.
A mob and other needs can be offered by the phone...
In fact, there is a Meditative and Religions Centre on the village territory for representatives of all conferences.
Well, the growth, in a private situation, has their own time.
With regard to the threat of lift from the nineth stage at the fourth, I decided to go down on the forest that is recommended and used during the fire.
And in the darkness it was about the bodies on it.
In fact, they were a sleeping partner of the new clinical company.
I guess, at any time, they decided to set up a quiet time directly on cold stations.
At the fourth stage, I was waiting for a meeting with an ancient known Vitalia Fedorovic Dubko, a trainer of our batuists who brought them to Olympian gold 16 years ago in Sidney.
He and his student, John Paul’s campaign, agreed kindly to show his commandments.
It's not a big fact that the Russian trainer's impressions have been divided. - We live two, they're sure that they're almost in the past, but it's not critical.
Sanusel one on four, but so space.
Scaff, of course, funny, of the tissue, doesn't make confidence, but things can be done.
"No, you're kissing, the tea's finished!", divorced Sweetlan Cuzney's tennisist's hands, meeting me at the main table.
The main name is at least because it represents a space of 2,70,000 km and is ready to accept 50,000 visitors simultaneously.
There are 60 billion puzzles in the hour.
Menu Options: "The Best of Brazil", "Work of the world", "Asiatic Foods" and "Pitaca, macaronary products".
The latest option, as I saw, is using a big popularity in our volunteers.
In addition, we say, I didn't find any of the gigant restaurants.
What are they?
It's good that I've got a chinese, an injured.
And the teaker.
But to understand, we've got food on the shorts yet worse.
Something can be chosen here, despite the unnecessary comparison.
I personally chose a trail on a couple and a frequency in a tomatic suit.
A table with each sheet is listed in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as in the indication of the food value of the product and the characteristics of the alergenes.
Well, all right, to admit that it was right.
I don't even understand why this kind of worth standing all the time in McDonald's.
The "this small" sportsmen on the outcome of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Pinding Agency (WADA).
They submit a victorine, a winner who gets a football.
They're running, you can say!
To get a gift, at least eight questions from ten should be answered correctly.
There are questions on Russian! The girl from WADA attacked me.
But it wasn't that.
That's what I've done in the patriote, naturally.
The situation was already addressed to the second question, "If I received a notice of the survey of the doping control, should I immediately go to the point of control?"
I stopped on "No, I've got one hour."
He lost, so he said, wake up.
I forgot that the WADA disasters have not been waiting.
In general, I'm gonna take it right now.
Well, at the seventh stage of the victoria, my situation became very critical.
I thought somehow that if I would be difficult to observe the balanced diet because of my body graphic (and I, in fact, hard!), I can use bioadditions to get "complete" to ask of arts to increase my productivity.
No, they're not allowed!
More precisely, the answer is formulated so that category is not prohibited, but consistently in several proposals.
It's not honest to play this WADA!
What's the matter, Russia?
To go somewhere behind Ethiopia, Isinbai and all our covered team.
That's why I focused, and I finally wined an accidental football.
You know what he says, ours!
In the winners, I took the fitness-Property for the neighborhood.
I've been able to count the trainers.
It's got 250.
He was surprised that no Russian sportsman had been found in this threat.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who doesn't play!
And there's one of our guys sitting in the neighborhood.
In the chair to the ocult.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In a police officer, as well as throughout the village, where no longer, there's an apparatus for the delivery of preservatives.
It is drawn on him, who calls, "Stop with the condom!"
There is only a sharp iron that reminds the door lock, and the preservatives made from the natural latex of the Amazonia are ready from the device.
I took myself for memory.
The sportsmen won't be surprised. They brought them 450 thousand.
As once for the celebration and celebration of the Olympian village, there is a whole distraction center.
It is due to the case of a known table that reminds the International Olympics Committee to trait $3,25 million per day in different ways.
The centre of video games, biljard and tennis tables, football and hoke and some strange devices similar to video trainers.
What is that? - I'm interested in a companion in the form of a Ukrainian collection, which actively uses a dicovine game.
Of course, you can just say that you don't want to talk to a man in the form of Russia's collection, yes.
Here, in some strange situations in the eyes, the guys in the yellow-black.
It's the most playing collection.
To go throughout the village, looking at each of its angles, we need no less than three hours.
But if you are walking, not going on the electrocars, you are also opening the house of a Canadian assembly with a hall of input and a box with a rebuilding wallet, and a ticket, and a chemical, and a parkmaster, and a color store, and a lab with goods of daily consumption, and a lot of unique marks (you can't even overcome a row from Chinese filtheists), and a bank, and a board of rents, and a oxyosk.
And after night, you're sitting near the olive tree, inflated with a colorful flower in memory of this world of friends and families of the athletes.
And you'll be under the company of the car, which is unrepentantly disturbed to die insects, think about everlasting.
That's about the olympical movement.
Whatever in this village is not stoping for a minute.
As long as the rest of the Russian world had a breathing observed how Australians almost had commanded the American Dream Team, the real sick ones went to the network.
A few people know that the news that Inna Deriglas won gold in the rapire on the XXXI Olympics games, I got the first.
Perhaps I'm even the only mosquito who saw this happening -- without considering those who looked at the construction in Carioca that night.
This can only understand the real sick.
Here's a deep Moscow night.
The neighbors below -- as always for the night -- are wake up and starting in the way, but it's very hard to cry to one another.
And threatening to move the mobile.
The kitchen runs, there's no time to eat on the market and buy as the new man asked.
In the television division, nothing is understandable, so I just kept on the control of the "Match", "The first" and "Russian" channels -- even though it's almost insignificant.
"Russia" is a family of repeated, the whole sport there's something in the record.
There are series in the direct epher translation.
The hope of the "Match" is, of course, a young man cried out in the news of sleep about the big semi-final of Deriglasov--Shanaev, then about the next battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of this basketball, the United States-- Australia.
I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on the Property, the first half of them were won.
It was placed on the office of the Americans' own office.
The result was still lost, but, as they are now expressed, the basketball olympical tourner will no longer be old.
It's all right, but it's close to De France, and on the screen without changing.
I'm starting to write channels in a easily panic.
That's how it feels, the second time it's cut.
All right, let's go deeply to the cab.
No one of the thematic "Mothers" physicians.
And, according to my feelings, the fight will be started.
Text and Twitter translation of some websites do not make me available.
The Court of Justice provides an unexpected, but a brilliant result.
The "Peergo" website is shown that the primary technical translation of all of the provisions that are at this time.
I'm clicking on the pharmaceutical, I'm getting a soldier for gold.
Deriglas is a great contrast, goes forward, and clearly begins to take time.
The Italian plays almost all the deterioration.
Our one point in front, at the end of at least more than two seconds.
De Francisco is moved to Deriglaz, and the time ends, and the Italian is on the side.
Victory!
For a few seconds, the Olympian mediator on the phone reports the fourth golden medal.
Looks out, I'm the first who saw it with my eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the associated.
The Dublin Muslim (DOM) has rejected the use of Russian language in the dreams.
The DOM prisoners yesterday committed their possessions to preach fifth-years only on the tatary to make young dad's "proof of their own tongue".
The Government states that it "not distorts" the right of the Muslims of other nationalities.
In some dreams, Kazani states that tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent, including foreign students, migrants and tatars.
We are afraid that their tataric preachers will not come to the whole audience.
The DOM Tatarstan held yesterday in prison agreed to take a decision on fifth-year preachers in the resp only in the Tatar language.
As Tatarstan's muffin Camil Samigullin said, this must be an incentive for young daddy to "search their tongue".
"For those who say that "heavy," in every big mistake, we are going to organize tatar language lessons absolutely free," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all the fields of preaching " must be already in tatary language".
He claimed that DOM Tatarstan was issued by the "Shura" magazine with typical preachers in Tatar.
I have, who doesn't say adequately well, "they can be prepared primarily."
DUM Tatarstan units more than thousands of income in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the muffy, fifth - year - day preaching is conducted exclusively in tatary.
At the same time, a number of dreams had been a major Russian language in Kazana.
In particular, as showed by the muffin, this was a pro in Burnai's Mute, Zacabana, and Aniler.
However, Mr. Muhamedhin stressed, the leadership puts the task of all students to possess both public languages of the resistance, independent of nationality.
"Nothing of which muslim-netatar can't be said," Mr. Muhametchin stressed, explaining that the preaching itself "is not an obligation, the main part of the assembly."
In the same way, the assembly will continue to read in Arabic, the songs will keep lessons and lessons in Russia.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "U", that there was no serious threat of tatary extinction from the dreams.
Furthermore, Russian and Tatarian other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used to preach in the Republic.
The DOM decision was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Conference Tatar (WTO).
The head of the WTO Rinat Zakirov said "E": "That is a important part of our national life."
It would be funny if the tatar language had gone out of this field.
He noted that the field of preaching only in the Tatar language "the desire of the owners," but in the WTO "requiredly".
The requested "E" has been ready to comply with the DOM decision, but they believe that there will be difficulties with the understanding of the priests.
There are also tatars, and Russians.
Many don't understand the language.
They, of course, will be worried.
"I'm going to break," says I've got the Burnaev Mote Farhat Mavletdin.
According to his words, the preaching in Russia is closer to many tarams, since "Russian and schools, and in Âsads, to the radio is everywhere significant."
However, he believes that in the mouths the lessons and lessons in Russia are continued in other days.
We trust in God.
Allah will show the outcome of this situation." He concluded.
But about 60 percent of us don't know the tatar language.
It's a bird, a tadjik, and azerbaijans.
There are many foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"This is why we are four years as we passed to Russian," says I have.
He believes that in the Tatar language the preaching will be "come to a lower circle and not to the entire audience."
But we'll be subject to the decision of the prisoner.
Only the outcome of the preaching will be another.
But it'll show time.
"I, for example, will only be more, because the Tatar language is my family," said Gabdula Galileen.

This, for example, confirms that the RMC was taken for the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally "poor" enterprises of the country, the Caribbean Mediterranean Combination.
The Caribbean Medical Deployment was an English accionary society headed with Leslie Urkvart in 1910.

The "Anime" effect Snapchat criticizes as asiatic characteristic
Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by an animium, but some observers say that it is racially inaccurate.
With the Snapchat Snapchat tool, approximately 150 million users per day can change the reality and play with individual ways that limit absurdly.
You can convert yourself to ananas, dogs or persons to make the picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
Linses are a crushed, and there are instruments that create more than 30 million decorated selfs daily.
Every mistakes becomes quickly public.
Linses Snapchat had been criticized in the past when they were accused of the application of the advertising that it was a dark skin or encouraged the whites as the ideal of beautifulness.
So when some users in this week offered a linz, which gave their hair eyes, the teeth and the fucking bottles, some critics believed that it was a racist karcatury on the Asiates, the "jeltolics".
And they questioned whether these repeated oppositions were indicated to the more serious problem of the company that was different.
In the middle of the reports on The Verge and Motherboard, reports were distributed on the day after Snapchat stated that they had removed this function.
Company's comment: Linse was designed as a relation to anonymous person, not as asiatic carcatera.
But the experts who know about racism have not heard the line of the stereo in the event.
Others rejected totally the comparison with anaemia.
In the e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student whose experiences were actively shared with the graphics, said that the line was "on the mortal and at least injury."
She added that "is hard to compare the side of a very severe career on Asiates and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just geal, but in higher degree, devastating yellows.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural pools.
American culture in an unfinished fight for multiformity and inclusiveness, starting from corporate meetings to Hollywood and girls we all have.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat - which are racially more numerous than their greater generation - may mean that they are more likely to understand.
When one of the Snapchat lines creates an image of the user's mortal, then, interviewed on Thursday 25-year-old Cathy Ju, "that's the events are much more difficult to remain unobserved as it was before."
On Thursday Jue, the manufacturing manager and engineer who works on Medium decided to remove its accounting record in Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in the phone interview, she said that racial opposite is the cause of an insufficient diversity in Snepchate.
Jue discovered the primary white leadership of the company, which was only men, and ended its article with the hastego: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Jue, who is the American Chinese origin, said, "If there were no enough white people in the state that could take such decisions or work small people, but they do not take the jobs on which they can be safe and openly speak."
Other observers divide her viewpoint by expressing disabilities because Snapchat did not answer the majority of her questions.
The company does not provide information on the presentation of national minorities in its state, highlighting its status of the private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but, according to the confidence, the company had recently adopted a recruiter to focus on the insufficient levels of the population and active attempts to carry out internal resources.
From her side, Jue said she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I am interested if they really need more users like us to say that they don't eat."
The military leadership was dismissed about IGIL, reporting the Committee of the Conference
The Secretary-General of the United States armed forces has changed the reports to make a more optimistic picture of war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than to give the event on the Conference, reported by the Committee on the Conference in the report issued on Thursday.
The Interim Report of the Operative Group, established by the Presidents of the Committee on Affairs of the Palace, the Committee on Auditors and the Subcommittee on Military Assistants, has found " widely distributed disabilities" among the analysis of the Centre Committee's Research Service, which claims that the Rulers have undertaken their American conditions for the winning over the Islamic State.
The Central Command, as Centcom, is the main military management in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in Central East and Central Asia.
"The documents of disclosure approved by the higher command of Centcom, as usually, gave a more optimistic picture of the United States Anti-Terrorist Sections than the real data are confirmed from the events and were more optimistic than the analysis provided by other services," it was stated in the issue of the news that was dedicated to the report.
"What happened in Centcom, it is unapproval that when the higher leadership is an uncertain analysis, our wars suffer," said a member of the Court of Representatives of Ken Calvert, the Republic of California.
Problems with the leading in Centcom have reached the most important organization.
The decade report contains detailed reports of the injuries which have been continually presented in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of the American Sections aimed at training Iraq's armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain the evidence that members of the Administration of Obama have proposed to fascinate reports, he claims that the analyses have felt that the Centcoma leadership forces them to present a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, as well as the IGIL or ISIL.
"In the first half of 2015, many press religions, statements and witnesses of the Central Committee in the Congress were significantly more optimistic than real events," reported in the report.
For example, the leader of Centcoma publicly stated that the major military attack for the return of Moses could be started in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second city of Iraq, remains under control of the Islamic State.
"With months of investigation, this is certain," said the member of the Palace of representatives of Mike Pompeo, a repository from Kansas.
From the middle 2014 to the middle 2015, the highest guide of the U.S. Centre Department of Investigation had been shared in order to reduce the threat of IHI in Iraq.
The Responseants created a operational group when they realized that the analyses expressed anxiety of the fact that the Islamic State has been undergone falsehood.
As long as the investigation continues, the report reported on Thursday follows more broadcast data.
Additional, not completed in the current investigation of the Centcoms, is conducted by the Chief In-Agency of the Defence Minister.
The representatives of the Democratic Party in the Committee on the Advertising of the United States Congress Palace of Representatives repeat their own data on Thursday with some of the conclusions of the Responsible Operation Group.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom has established a excessively closed production procedure for IHI and the Iraq Protection Army," states the member of the Court of Representative Adam B. Shiff, the main representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, according to Shiff, "harmonized the issue of investigated documents," caused the damage of the moral status of analysis and "inadequately reflected the exhausted views".
But Shiff and the Democrats say that they have not found evidence of the fact that the White House was trying to encourage the Centcom's analytics to submit their conclusions under the "determined or political interpretation".
Prepare the results of the Congress investigation were presented on Monday the Daily Beast Portal.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the investigation of the main intention of Pentagon, opened after the Centcom analytical complaint.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, stated that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the conference report until the main intentions were continued to investigate.
But he said that "experts are sometimes differing in opinions in the processing of complex data, and the Defence Services and the Defence Minister welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues relating to national security."
The consequences of the investigation are based on the issue of whether the aims of the American bombing in Iraq and Syria are achieved (which now states more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the last year statements have been doubted whether President Obama might believe that the Central Command provides true military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of the Islamic State repeated the disputes that had been placed over ten years ago when the Centcom Gregory Huker's divorce analysis wrote an investigation in the article in which it was approved that the administration of President George Wooker Bush, because of the protest of many analytics, had been supported by a small number of army in Iraq and did not think that it would be followed in 2003.
Huker also played a key role in the protest of the Islamic State.
In the past year, the Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements on return, aircrafts on petrol traffickings belonging to the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration of the financial situation of terrorist grouping, because it built temporary nephtherapeutics to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not extended to the parts of the Central Command, as reported in September, the Times newspaper.
In the last year, after witnessing in Senate, general Lloyd J. Ostin III, the committee was critical, which many deputates had considered too optimistic war assessment.
General Austin went to the department in April and was replaced in the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Vtel.
The United States wins four times in the female hoke on grass, so close to the decision to British
When he had killed three bullets in a bullet, which had been won over Japan with account 6-1, Cathy B' opened the first two votes of the United States ' s female hockey team on grass on Thursday when the Americans received a winning over India's team with 3-0.
Five in two games must be a reminder of the achievement, but B, whose 27 years of age, states that she would never have done something like it.
"I won't apply," she said.
I'm not really one of those who follow their heads.
This is what she knows: The Americans 4-0 in the Olympian tour, and they are going to be the first place in their group with Britain, which remains invisible after Japan's expiry, with 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and the United States commands will be meeting the Sabbath in the last game of the first tour.
Both teams claim fourth-fine, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams and who is the second.
The winner will escape meetings with a strong team of counterparts from the Netherlands, leaders of another group, with a little pleasure when the four-final game is started.
However, the Sabbath game shows that the Americans here have made a sound of their unexpected series, after four years after they took the last place among 12 teams in London games.
B was in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pen Property, first to take a shock for hokey on grass when she was 3 (the older sisters were playing in this type in Drexel), and joined her to a national collection of 16 years of age, became her youngest player in history.
She lost the Olympiade 2008 when it did not pass the election tour to the final set.
Then it was 2012, when it wasn't all at her and her companions on the team.
In the last year, Koyg Parnch, an English, was appointed by a trainer, and all began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological changes, physics-preparation changes," said B.
We had no production now in London.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, B's opened the account in the first half of the game with an inappropriate hand on a short distance.
India came to the game without a single winning in the tour, but the team was to be surprised by a wreck and maintained the 1 to 0 until the end of the third period when the B's initiative was taken into its hands.
She made a long walk with the sword down to the left side of the field, and then the stops went into the middle of the gate, and she strictly sent the foot to the gate, and gave the Americans the benefit of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzáles added a final hole in the middle of the fourth period.
The "sushwa" winning was the first to the U.S. port of Jackie Briggs, who spent on one hole in each of the first three winnings.
She's in a shot.
Like B.
"We are in good position right now," said Parnch, but how good it depends on the result of the Sabbath Game.
In the middle of the Olympics games, the "day" of the bath
Wherever you are, whatever time is now, it's Olympiad.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be unchanged and uncertain, and it is an extreme compliance with the implementation and effort.
It's the olympical fire itself, and there's the burning fashion that is transferred from the bullet to the plant, to the gymnaste, to the triathlonist.
You can't include television, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the coffee and not hear about Simon Bailes, Cathy Ledeki or an enemy between Michael Felps and Chaddam de Clo.
And there's Logan Duley.
Duli, first involved in the Olympics games, could be full of the names that are placed in the time of sponsors and lifeless reklame roles, if he was a pool, a gimnast or even a phytopharmaceutical.
But the 28-year-old Duley from Lake Forest in California fights for gold in Olympics on the bath.
The Olympical Fire does not flash all the same events.
Further than the center, partly in the shadow, the species that I do not recognize are: the shooting of the fifth gun, the shooting of the bowl, the badminton, the teqwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long kingdom.
But if I have been allowed to make sure to protect my personal disturbance, let me give your attention to the humility of the bath.
Though the batuths have been the Olympian species since 2000 when they have been able to play in Sidney, they have received so little recognition in the past 16 years that many of my requested people have not been in the course that they have been related to Olympian species.
This may be regional uncleanness.
Although the United States and sent sportsmen to the construction, they never won't win medals in the bath, and you're not their sportsmen at the end until 2012.
Chinese and Russian, as usually, share men's rewards, and Chinese and Canadians are women.
Dun Dun from China and Rose will protect their London golden medals this year.
But the bathroom of the bath is an authsideder chamber, especially because they are more associated with the circle college than with the Olympian games.
Here I have to admit that I'm not a expert, but only an aternal enthusiasm.
They actually have a comic potential, it is a characteristic lack of unfinished beverages, but also the eating of hymnistics and springs in water, two species of which they are mainly accountable.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolin", which means "tramplin for water-scake".
The winners are on the giant bath, flying in the air at nearly 30 feet, and have to carry out a series of acrobatic tricks (reverses, snippets and salt) to the slow landing of the feet.
They are evaluated on the implementation, complexity and "times of the flight" of the Official Olympics Games.
Thirty-two sportsmans from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will be gathered to Rio.
The most distributed olympical course is forward.
The representatives of the medal must go further, faster, upward and upward after gold, sometimes to finish, and sometimes up and forward, there in the field.
They strive not only to a finish or start wall, but also to a telecommunication, a different worm: a world or olympical record.
This is a delicate desire, worthy of exciting, even fanatic, and it is enough to make even a looker gone.
But I think it's the same thing that's deteriorating the game's view.
He's a bathroom's kidnapping.
Batutis is upstairs.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she goes up, it's not known as astronaut, flys up, then down, then no effort again.
Of course, they do not have any competition or work, but throughout the programme there is no stupid concern for finishing, no debt in length, only a wonderful, fair degradation of time and gravity.
It's the most closer to the Olympics species.
Women's currencies and then the final will pass on Friday, translation on the day on the East Time; men are on the Sabbath, too on hour.
The NBC will translate the final in the framework of the daily programme starting at 14:00 on both day.
It is expected that the olympical deterioration is a peaceful moment, which can be easily looked at in a total.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by undertaking the sportsmen's views and objectiveization — as the Wall Street Journal, recently proposed men of the United States, Duli just waits for his new stumbled fanates.
"Protest generation" in Ethiopia, the former Union of the United States
Great protests in Ethiopia
Democrats who require political changes in Ethiopia have committed a cruel opposite from the Government.
Evidents say that tens of protestants were deadly hurt during the confusion of the sex.
Is Ethiopia actually located on the border of the scourge?
In the last decade, she was one of the most stabil countries, a strong West Union with quickly developing economy.
But in the past months, anti-governmental protests have extended the country to a larger number of its territory.
Only in the last week, thousands of people went out on the street, needing radical political changes.
According to human rights protectors, the Government's reaction was violent.
Clears claimed that the police officers had shot tens of unwarmed demons.
Video records from protests, predicted at the end of the past or at the beginning of this year, have been recorded as the security officers struggle young people with their hands at the wall.
The highest official person of the United Nations for Human Rights now calls for a close investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country from disaster, and it will be more complicated," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Rog project in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second guest population country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and divorce services cooperate closely with the Ethiopians to take place terrorism threats in the region, especially in Somali, and almost no country in the west is supported.
Ethiopia's economy is developed with impressive speed.
Her infrastructure has been significantly improved — there is even a new holiday road in Addis-Abeb.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, the Ethiopia was a model of democracy — human rights organizations are continually mentioned on government repressions - the opposition of the State has been crossed because the dissidents have actually stopped to quiet.
Many of them were sent, arrested, killed or cast into remote wilderness.
But that can change.
"If people continue to deceive and do not remain other options except to protest," said Seyum Tessome, the lector of the University in Central Ethiopia.
All the youth will protest.
The generation is protesting.
Injuries are numerous, starting from landing, and ending by the Governing Coalition Authority.
After a widely critical election last year, the Governing Party and its unions have completely stressed the opposition and are now controlled by 100 per cent of the Parliament.
At the same time, the pressure to the border with Eritrea is to be stressed; the fight for this undetermined border brought hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics are threatened that separatist groups, which have been more or less in the past years, such as Oromo's freedom Front or Ohaden's national freedom, may try and use disturbances and overcome.
A number of factors explain why heavy feelings, a few years of depth of soul, are now insulting.
The first seems to be perfectly invisible: smartphones.
Only in the past few years, a large number of ethiops had been able to communicate in networks, since rain smartphones became dinner, and the Internet was better.
Even when the Government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often happens, especially during protests, many still find the opportunity to communicate with the servers who hide where they are.
Some young Ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Secondly, there is more solidarity between Orome and Amhar, two major Ethiopic ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhar are not natural aliens.
During the centuries, Amhar from the primary Christian high-heaven regions of Ethiopia was well-being in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom I am Muslims and in low-term areas.
But it also changes.
"We'll make a community at the same beginning," said Mulatu Gemach, leader Oromo.
The major protests passed in the areas of Amhar and Orome.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that members of the Tigrai group are injustly dominated in Ethiopia, which consists of approximately 6 per cent of the population and controls military services, trade and policies.
The third cause of disappointment is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, the former Resurrection Leader, has fulfilled the responsibility of the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years, to get to death from no disease in 2012.
He was a tactic gene, a man who could predict the danger.
Analytics claim that he was especially experienced to recognize the first signs of deficiency and determined the indicators to obtain data and disturbance of opponents.
"The external regime doesn't suffice to have a healthy sense," said Abdy, an analysis of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Haylemariam Desalin, came near and took Melesa place.
In contrast to Melesa, who was a generation from the region of Tigrai in North Ethiopia, Hylemaram is a South.
Analytics say that he does not use the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigrai.
Many are afraid that this would lead to more blood proliferation.
The last time, Ethiopia survived such anxieties in 2005, after thousands of people expressed protests against the fact that, as the analysis said, there appeared to be elections that the Government had taken and then made the results.
In the course of the follow-up of the repression, many protestants were killed, even though in less than the last months, and the period of disappointment was quickly passed.
The developing experts expressed appreciation for the Ethiopian leaders for a long-term infrastructure development, such as a new intergovernmental stage and a success in combating poverty.
But it obviously did not stop the increase in the internal deficiency by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
The past month protesting in Gondor, the city in Amhara, the attitude of Tigrai, and the anti-Tygray hatred in the networks becomes a comprehensive.
Analysis states that protesters are putting the United States and other Western Unions into an inappropriate situation.
The American Government replied to Ethiopia as a base for non-pilot flights over the neighbors of Somali, although it recently announced that this base had been closed.
On the other hand, the west wants to support the democracy, but he does not want his union to lose power in the instable region.
"And this will be difficult to pass on the channel," said Abdy.
Donald Tromp explains his statement that IHIL was Obama, "sarkasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the last conflict with its pre-elected staff on Friday, saying that he had shot when several times this week he said that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "based" terrorists of the Islamic State's grouping.
The explanation has made new issues of the candidate to the post of the President from the Republican Party to address the American people.
It also placed its substitutes who were trying to protect him during the disorder period because they had to explain the statements that he probably did not mean.
When Trump expressed this advice on the middle of the evening, he determined to be held on his office on Thursday, repeating the interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton were based on IGIL.
But in the post in the Twi'er early morning, Thrump wrote that he was just echydishing.
This post was a direct opposite to the fact that it was done all the day before the Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his accusation.
When the radio-conservator Hugh Huitt tried to help the Trump to reduce the statement to him that Obama wanted to make IGIL, the candidate to the President's post from the Republican Party did not have the opportunity.
The last scandal was discovered when Trump tried to reorient his campaign to the economy at the background of the rating reduction.
Thrump and Clinton were speaking with competitors on the economy in Michigan this week.
Thrump tried to return to this subject on Friday.
But when he returned to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to increased taxes, and said that it had been nice.
Thrump has already shown the sarcasm as a correction.
At the end of July, after he reached a universal criticism, he practically expressed the idea that the Russian should break the electron rate of Clinton, he later explained his comments, saying, "Now, I'm crazy."
This approach allows the Trump to take the terms of the political matter and to take its words back, if necessary.
"I think that it's his way to test those or other messages that respond among his worshippers, to see how they do, and then to "explain" them on the one or other side, depending on the response," said Ruth Sherman, a communicate expert who conducted an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and knows that they are sufficiently disappointed to treat them differently.
Instead of mixing the statements for a wide elector, the Trump took a more vulnerable ton in the last days while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist review showed that the Trump arrives in Clinton with a large overview in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and goes with it to Florida.
Although Trump is usually trying not to excuse for the provocational things that he says, he often accuses his critics in a wrong interpretation of his words and disappointment of his feelings of humor.
But since the Trump’s object of higher attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, its wounds have placed his faithful unions in an unusual situation: they should be publicly supported by any provocation of his statements.
Rudolf W. Julian, former Mr. New York, who was one of the most responsibility suppliers of Trompa, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the interview of the CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Julian, when he asked the Trump that Obama and Clinton were based on the Islamic State.
It is true that before Obama IHIL was almost not a small organization, he called her a no threat, absolutely unjust, and that's why it happened because he brought an army from Iraq.
Most Medinstatists assured that the Oma administration, in which Clinton was posted by the Governing Secretary, allowed IHI to develop, because I am not able to make the situation seriously in the Middle East.
Before moving to Penvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media of mass information for the discussion of each of its words and the preference to it.
He went over the "fair" television experts who try to talk to him, and said, "They are!"
The democracy had a mistake to the Trump as much as it would be in the case of the President.
Sometimes the coffee is returned to Greenpoint
The Verb coffee was a coffee that only takes a place in Williamsberg, where no Wi-Fi was, but gave a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was removed from her place with a vitrina at Bedford Aven.
The Soup Sheri magazine, who took the "Verb" place in 2014, is being sold in the form of cakes.
Local residents paid it as the last loss in the renewal town.
"New York is always changing, I know, but I can't believe that CBGB's dead, Chalsy's a lot disrupted, and Verb's now a mixture."
But although New York is always changing, he is, in its own way, updated.
Verb's birth coffee opened in November last year in Greenpoint less than in the mile north of the original place.
The new Verbe contains Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same and similar atmosphere.
Moreover, the coffee is still good.
In the new Verba chapter, Sisko Rodriguez, an old coffee, who is a owner and general manager of the new.
He started working in Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the customers proposed to propose it to the new Property, he said he would be happy to do that.
Rodriguez, whose 36 years of age, has left many in ancient view.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same coffee model.
It has even been set up a glass from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he would like to experiment.
He offered new foods.
The menu contains sandwiches with becon, eggs and sickness, and they are like to be throwns of capers or of grass.
There's a fucking rice.
The coffee is no longer under birds, but now it's prepared for fresh sucks.
Rodriguez said that he had taken attention to the unchanged flow of older continuous customers.
"Most many clients would also have granted prices from Williamsberg," he shared.
One of the recent resurrections of Rebekah Olivier was one of such customers.
Olivia, whose 34 years old, lived in Williamsberg before and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that exactly the coffee and the imposing atmosphere came to me in Verbe," she said.
Now she drinks a coffee again, although it's for a tea, another news on that day.
Tom Rosental, another ancient client, has been loyally visiting Verb since 2003.
He walked before the EEC and commanded the same.
"In fifteen minutes of eight, every day, as for hours, I came, and for me my oil bail was prepared with all the ways," he said.
Rodriguez reported that he wanted to experiment and introduced new cartridge in the menu.
Today, Rosental makes a ordinary order, but he ever changes something with a bacon, eggs or syringe with all ways.
Rodriguez said he wasn't in trouble that the mixed store had ever acquired an old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sheri proposed to prepare a wheel for Verba using coffee prepared by cold way as an engineer.
"I think we may agree to their proposal," said Rodriguez.
Permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint of the Polish origin are also invoked by the coffee.
One of these new customers transfered the menu to the Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for him in the vitrine so that his new neighbors would feel likely.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local point for sale of socks is planning to separate the bottles and to sell coffee in cold manner.
There is the possibility that the coffee will join himself more closely than it is.
For many customers, it is enough that the new Verb will include their favorite sheets in the menu.
Joseph White was a permanent customer and shared that he was killed by a mountain when they were closed.
When the coffee was opened at the new Property, Witt said that when he entered and ordered a coffee, he felt like he came home.
"How long I wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive depression meal in the "Plottapeze"
In March 1933, after the president's arrival, Franklin Delano Rusvelt was sent to be in the Ovulal Office.
As a gourman, President Rusvelt loved the fifth Avenue's modest guards, such as fua-gra and the Mirland's swimming supper.
His menu on this day was more humiliated: the fashioned eggs in the tomat soose, the cartoffle pipe and the dessert pudding from black eggs.
"This was a act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Zegelman.
Her husband Andrew Kou added, "This was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Women living in B.H.H., I'm specialists for food history.
After the book of Koa, Ragu in China, it was dedicated to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Zigelman Rass' history of life in the neighborhood apartment in the Netherlands Islands through food in its book "Home 97 on the FITG Garden".
Their new joint work "Plotna table", which will be opened by Harper issue on Thursday, is a story of American food in the Great Depression.
In some degree of their own culinary solidarity, they met the reporter for a dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a little swimming dish in the Flatheron quarter, which works since 1929, of the Birge's wound.
Zigelman, 54, took Indian, cartridge and fruitful mixture for the sugar and butterboat with olive cups, and Cou, 57, for the cartridge, and for the mixture of fruit.
When the reporter commanded a meat role, the couple considered this as a suitable point for the discussion on food at Depression's time.
"The Rulets used a big question," Zegelman said.
There was an archaetic roll, a wheat, a bob rolete.
They were made from the main index and raw products that allowed the index to be used.
Imagine that you ate so much arachis as you need for dinner.
Who's getting silent.
"It was probably lying in a yellow stone," he said.
In the years before Depression, the American table, especially in the agriculture, represented a Swedish table.
The group of women was prepared for men of the farm, and the fresh-proof pig was offered for dinner, dinner and dinner.
The Americans have directly sent food to the Hungerers during the First World War. The "Ploteboard" describes how the country has been able to stop being a country of possession.
"This was the time when the food became a central, simple topic for Americans," said Cou, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same was a new budgetary ratio: mysterious foods such as roletes and coverages were the main food products; the cup is the "beauty way to stumble foods", noted Zigelman, because the wheel could hide the non-aphettic inhibitors under the stuck of sous.
Fresh FIAs were replaced by more raw suhof.
Meat, the former foundation of the American food for many years, became economically designed.
People test strange mixtures because energy and food values have become more important than cut and even culinary health sense.
By studying the book that includes recipients, Zigelman prepared the damage of the period: a bowl, a fashioned archaetic oil.
"This addition to the table was not successful," Kou said.
Zegelman added, "This was very strange."
Arachis oil is not perfectly suitable to the frozen oil.
This was characteristic for many household recepts.
As never before and ever since, household specialists, including Louise Stanley, the federal office head of the Office, have managed food habits from 1923 to 1943.
With recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advise women to become " budget providers" to accept and transform a bullshit like a lost spaghetti with marine in the cushion.
The "Plotboard" is a pitch of interesting historical facts.
Especially picking stories about the reaction of the Government to the citizens, such as the position of President Herbert Guvern in the spirit of "unleavened birds."
It was publicly transported by a simple farmer town of Iowa at his time, and he died as a deceased millioner of them.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, the fish with the egg soose," Kou said.
He ate practically in the golden table, putting the smoking.
He was awakened from reality.
President Ruswell could make the same mistake if his wife, Eleazar, had not advised him to give an example to her own jealousy.
As reported in the book, Eleanor Ruswellt took an economy, which was not totally interested in cuss, and it led to that "the White House used not only the most unusual food in Washington, but some of the most disgustingly prepared."
Many of the culinary receipts of Depression were forgotten as the country was resurrected.
Their inheritance is our continuous focus on calories and food, says Zigelman, and how science was used to prepare food.
The husbands tell that during the writing of the book, they better understanded the food habits of the mother of Zegelman — she couldn’t eat, for example.
"He was seriously scared of a noble food," said Cou.
Ziggelman mentioned, "It's a whole series of people."
There was an inappropriate case with profiles.
When the balls in Eisenberg's were devastated, they and Cou received a dessert that made home: a dessert from black-coat that President Rusvelt eated for dinner.
"This is called a moss from black bottle," Zegelman said, adding that it was distributed by receipts to give the modesty recepts of broad names.
It was not just a black, a little swimming, a sachar, water, and a corn.
Everyone with her carryed a bed in a low, brushing, nice thing.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
He asked for additives twice.
By the vote of the convinced budget builder, he said to the woman, "There would not be interrupted by a few greek orchards."
The arrest of the figures on the mass drake on the Hovan board was extended until 14 November
By 14 November, the Pressence Court left the case of the figures on the mass drag on the Hovenian board, satisfied the corresponding consequences.
The case is 14 persons who are accused of being accused.
On 14 May, there was a mass drake of several hundred outcomes from Central Asia and North Kawka with the use of weapons, which resulted in the death of three people.
The former royal officer of Juria Chabueva and a lawyer, a complainant of the "Source Nation" of Alexander Bocharnik, has been accused of murder organisations.
A question of the second year for 2016 can be decided during the next two-three weeks.
This was reported by the President of the Government of the RF Olga Holodец on 12 August during the visit to the Britain area.
We have specific parameters to increase the pension in order to reduce the inflation existing in the country.
All accounts are made.
Economys are now undergoing the results of a half-year, and we will finish this in the next two-three weeks," quotes the Hungry Interfax.
In commenting on the proposed Chapter of the Centre of Ages to Alexander the Cowdrian Pension Age Scheme for a half year, the vicepresident reported that this issue was not considered in the cabine.
On the end of July, the position of the Government for the full index of pension payments was found in 2017.
The rocks and the Gregorians passed to the final with shoots from a little caliber wine.
The Russian sportsmen Sergei Kamenski and Kirill Grigorian passed to the final of shooting from a little caliber wine from the town at the Olympian games in Brazil.
As TASS reports, Sergei Kamenski took 629 balls and took the first place, it was a new Olympics record in the kwality.
Cyril Grigorian second is 628.9 billion.
Eight best sportsmen have passed to the final.
The Steel is a world recorder in that discipline (633).
The Turkish opponent of Fethulah Gulen requires international investigation of the circumstances of the trial of public converting to Turkey.
"I need an independent international committee to investigate the tentative of public turn," quotes the French Journal of Le Monde.
The Turkish opponent also said, "If some of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen rejects the partiality of mystery, highlighting that he has never claimed political authority.
The Court of Justice of Stambula had previously arrested the opposition of the Islamic Preacher of Fethullah Gjulene.
At the same time, the trial of military turns occurred in Turkey at night from 15 to 16 July.
Gilead companies will pay costs for services in time for a patient from hepatitis with Merck
The Gilead Sciences Inc company has the right to get the expenditure to the services that it has made in relation to a serious hepatitis patent with the manufacturer of medicines Merck & Co Inc has established a Federal Environmental Court.
In June, the Gilead company was released from the payment of 200 million dollars for the charge of two Merck firm patents relating to the drugs of Gilead, Swaldi and Harvoni, after the American court found a number of distortions from the Merck company, including the lie under the prosecution and other non-ethical acts.
By returning to court on Thursday, Beth Labson Friman said that the Gilead company had the right to refund the costs made in the course of a demand.
Merck's company is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of medicines from hepatitis C, which can treat more than 90 per cent of patients with disease.
In 2013, the work was done when Gilead and Merck sent each other to court, declared their rights to the laboratory, based on the subsidiarity, the active inhibitor of the company of Gilead medicines.
Armed forces created by the United States support claim that they have overcome full control over Manifest in the Islamic State
The armed forces established under the support of the United States took full control over the north town of Manbidge near the Turkish border, after the last in the town of the Islamic State's fighting went out, the representative of the group reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic forces (SDS) are now pursuing the city after the rest of a group of fighters hidden in the city.
They released more than 2.000 civil delegates held by fighters, reported to the Agency Reather Shar’ Darvish from the Federal Union with the Manbydge military Council.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we're undertaking the cleaning operations," he reported to the Reather Agency.
Clinton for $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
Hillary Clinton discovered its tax declarations for 2015, which showed that the candidate in the president of the Democratic Party and her husband had 10,75 million income dollars in this year and paid an effective federal tax of 34,2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in the form of favorable contributions, mainly in the Fund of Clinton, the former President Bill Clinton received approximately $5,3 million in the form of honours for the statement, and the former State Secretary claimed that the issuer of Simon & Schuster had been income for its book of residence in the State Department.
The potential Vice-President Clinton, the Senator of the United States, Tim Cain from Virginia, and his wife Anna Holton, have been reported in tax declarations for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective feeding tax of 20,3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kein continue to establish the financial transparency standard," said the Clinton Jennifer Palmer's adviser.
In their full opposite, Donald Trump is hidden for subsequent accusations and urges his previous promises to discover its tax declarations.
This is the usual case for candidates in the chairmans of the United States - to make their tax declarations, although the law does not require it.
The New York Businessman Trump and his staff called a verification of the State Tax Service as a reason for its refusal to find their tax declarations.
"Your walk," wrote the Clinton Yan S. Advisor of the Presidency of the Clinton C.C., as a declaration of the candidate from the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, the Special Adviser Trampa Michael Coen said CNN that it would not allow the Trump to release them before checking.
The Kritics of Trompa, including the candidate at the president of the Republic of the Party in 2012, said that his refusal was to address his status, its benefital contributions, its business operations and other links, including Russia.
Clinton took this question and released on Friday a video where the main place was carried out to the published repositories who convinced the Trump to find the tax report.
On Thursday, she raised this question during the statement of the economy in Michigan.
"He refused to do what each candidate had done without exception in the president for decades: to discover his tax declarations," she said with him.
The Country of Politico reported that Trump had not paid any or almost any tax in the 1990s, but business injured in New York Times’ newspapers on Friday, a number of tax charges and accountants who believe that the facts may be so far.
The federal charges were the subject of the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rule referred to in honor of the Officer, the Invitor Warren Baffet, which would guarantee that the people receiving more than 1 million dollars per year would have a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At the meeting with Clinton last week in Omama, Nebraska, Baffet, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, proposed the Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffet said he was also under the IRS check and that the Trump was "free" not a tax collection agency, but the electors.
Clinton's pre-selected staff reported tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons, now in Chappaqua, New York, have made an average federal tax of approximately 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax of approximately 40.5 per cent.
Clinton's declaration for 2015 by that, in contrast to most Americans, only for $100 of their resources were payable.
Their main investment was an unworthy indigenous payment fund, and Clintons claimed that the debtors and capital income were $109.000.

Preservatives with chile and feedingstuffs increase the protection of dance slopes
Environmental fighters in Tanzania use a non-traditional way to interfere with the slopes in the population of the ships — ruptures filled with chili.
The method was effective, and Honeyguide Foundation, which came to this idea a few years ago, with the American Nature Protection Committee, took its movement by teaching volunteers in northern Tanzania and using the four-stairy architectural way to protect their homes and habitats without the cause of animals.
Many earlier listen to a copy to protect themselves.
On Friday, the World Day of Slowans will be dedicated to the protection of animals.
"When we have received a set of instruments, we observe the change in these communities, so they are much more sure that they have no slopes in their field without cause of the slopes of the Honeyguide Damian Bell," said the Executive Director Honeyguide.
The first two steps are in the burning of the fake before the slone border and the signal supply by the corner.
If it couldn't be scared, then leave it as called "Choly cloud".
The boy's bowl, mixed with the ground, is located with a boy in the preservative, and his end is deceived, and the outside is only a fitil.
When preservatives are burned, it is covered with the rubber, and it is cut off a small rubber of chili in the air.
One spirit is usually enough to expand the slone on the other side.
The end of the measure is a busy device that shoots the Roman arrows in the air, making a sound, light explosion.
To Turkey, 32 Turkish diplomats were not returned to Turkey, which abandoned the country after the trial of mystery in July of this year.
Such data brought the head of the Turkey MID Mevlut Chavushoglu in conversation with journalists.
At the first stage, we responded to 208 frame diplomats to continue in the centre.
32 of them were not returned without objective reasons and explications," said the chapter of the Turkish External Policy.
The fact that in July, in Turkey, a trial of public turn was made.
The Governments of the countries have officially stated that the lady was lost and reported to the detention of more than six thousand people, including military works of higher and medium-term.
As a result of the temptation of Mrs. Turkey's MID, 290 people were killed.
The Regisseur strictly discovered the Berlin hotel for the removal of Israel's phone code on the "demand" Arabs -- reported RT News
The French register of the Jewish origin has broken a scandal in the MI, found that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin has no phone code in Israel, while the servants are on "demands" from Arabian customers.
Claude Lanzman, author of the documentary film on the Holocauste "Shoa", expressed his deficiency by Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, wrote an open letter in the German FAZ FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lanzman hotel, he tried to find Israel in a list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among States where it could be called directly from the committee.
How could Israel be excluded in Berlin in 2016, the capital of the new Germany?
He wrote Lanzman.
Kempinski Bristol is replaced by the opportunity to carry Israel through its own telephone service center.
In the search of the explanation, the register raised this issue on the steadfast hotel administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, "shock" of him.
Clerk of the hotel said that this measure was a "deep decision to lead the Kempinski Islands Network".
The reason that followed this step was to be a great wrath of the register.
"The majority of our Arab guests, and they need to remove Israel's code," he said, by the Lanzman's service of the hotel.
The staff of Israel in Germany, James Hades-Handlesman, called the case as a "treamed wound", reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were packed and shocked by the incident.
It's actually an injury.
What this happened in Germany and exactly in this network of hotels, it is still a big deterioration.
There's no need for explaining here.
We expect that the hotel will make the conclusions," said the reporter.
It was called a low resonance on the Internet; people called it as a scandal.
Although Kempinski's hotel was simply "forwarded" in the preferred Arab clients' requirements.
"There would be confused," said another post, where it was indicated that the hotel situated on the glorious Kurfurstendamm Street is near the synagogue.
The hotel has successfully dismissed any accusations, called "inspective" and "excused" before Lanzman, reports the journal Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order to not include Israel in the list of a quick set," cited the words of the representative of the Kempinski hotel of Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that code is now added.
Police uses trailer gas and rezin bullies against protesting Brazil students
Students were joined in the city of San Paulo in Brazil on Thursday when they were gathered to protest against Governing Reforms of State Education.
Police was exposed to trailing gas and resistance pumps against protesters.
The police were started when the police were trying to disturb students, and the police resulted in resinus bulls and washing gas.
Several hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their concern for plans.
In the proposals of the Governor of San-Paulo Geraldo Alckmin will be closed by approximately 100 public media schools, and 300 000 students will be re-approvaled to scan the money.
Some protest participants could be seen as written on the walls of the Graffitis against the provisional responsibility of President Michael Themer.
This last protest occurred only a few days after the protesting mass went out on the street to support the remote president of Dilmu Rusef when the country's seats voted for her impression.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 %, reporting the RT Business portal
With a refusal of sanctions, the trafficking between Moscow and Tegeran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to Russia ' s sentence to Iran Levan Jagaran.
Since sanctions against Iran were dismissed, the increase in interest from the Russian firms in business in the country is observed, said the employee.
Russian companies renew connections with Iran and new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, the further extension of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Jagarian.
He noted that, in the first five months of 2016, the marketing between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and with €856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, up to 158 million dollars.
Increasing trade was due to the supply of machinery, land transport and weapons,” said the employee.
Jagarian also predicts that Russia will visit a recurrent number of Iranian tourists this year.
In the past year, the representation of Russia in Iran has granted approximately 35.000 visions, mainly tourists, to the citizens of Iran.
Moreover, Iran first entered the top-20 countries by the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It may be assured that the last year record on the number of Iranian tourists, visiting Russia, will be killed," he said.
At the same time, a few Russian visits Iran that hoped that it would change.
"I personally recommend visit the city of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jez, in which the memories of ancient Persian civilization are maintained in a good state," he said.
The State continues to cross the pools in a defence-industrie complex.
The deal of freedom was "the non-compliance system" of the "Almaz-Antey" and "the loss of confidence".
It was appointed by the NGO's officer for nearly three years by Gennadi Benderski.
The Incompetence on the freedom of Nescorod was only on Thursday evening and did not have a broad range in the SME.
How can such silence be explained in terms of exhaustion of the army?
It is likely that the RF leader does not want to spread any hearing or negative suggestions in the public environment.
This recently confirms that a defense-industrial complex (OPC) exists problems and that the State does not want to draw closer attention to them from the society.
The elimination of the Necorodov is, of course, an important event from the view of the visit of the adult.
NGO "Almaz" is a concern undertaking which is specialized for the production of zenith-racet complexes (CRC) of maritime and earthly basement.
"Almaz" is currently a work on the creation of Polyment-Redut and Morphey, which are planned to set up on new crops, frequencies, esminers and creators.
Easners of the Military Russian Portal Dmitry Cornev believe that the freedom of the Nescorodov has been called for a deterioration of the projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the "Morthea" was still started in 2007, and the introduction was expected in 2013.
"Poliment-Redut" must be the main PSO system on the newest VMF vessels.
According to the information I received, in several years, no actual successful experience has been completed.
True, as long as I can judge, there is no unique guilty of Almaza," said Cornev.
The expert fears that a delay in the operation may also occur with the C-500 SRK.
Experience in the project has not been completed, but the first complexs should be taken to military during 2016.
The Mino Defence assures that "a is planned and that everything will be completed at the latest time", although in 2014 acknowledged the problem with the C-500 dilution.
It is complicated to give a professional quality to the Nescorod, which has ruled the Almaz since 2011.
Cornew conscious that the time limits of projects may be as well as the cause of freedom.
It believed that in recent years, information on internal processes in the OPC and undertakings plans was very difficult.
The growth has received long-term orders for decades of billion rubles, and great money likely loves silence.
Of course, the Director of Defence Company is debt on its own desire, under the agreement of the parties, or to another.
In this case, the elimination has occurred publicly, even though there was no reason.
It insists that Almaza's rue was probably a stripful figure and opposed the top of the "diversity".
In all cases, the State has no more peace with such behavior.
It will remove those who prefer to carry out Minor Defence institutions and do not carry out the assigned tasks.
At the same time, RF's leadership is trying to test the administrators (diminutions on the " Stars" courts).
Increasing attention to the issues of the sector is given to the President.
Vladimir Putin is headed by the military industry committee and periodically conducted meetings dedicated to the violation.
He protects a number of OPK managers, seeking to have a loyal sum of directors, which will carry out the top of the displacement.
This is a far non-ideal policy, but there is no other instruments in the State in the background of corruption and the absence of normal competition.
The situation in defense, of course, is not a disastrous but the current geopolitical situation stimulates Chreml as far as possible to bring armed forces into order.
Parallelly, the RF leadership in the OPC has completely taken successful steps to enhance the professionalism of the Russian armies.
The carriage of the Army has received a new quality with the arrival to the Minister of Defence of Sergei Shaogo.
It is impressive that the President took the "Worlds of the World - prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military force of the SSR and the nuclear parity in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pacte, which strengthened the Moscow impact on the continent.
In all the lack of the bipo system, it worked effectively.
The evidence of this was that there was no war at the Peace continent and a sustainable situation in the Middle East.
The "victors" in the cold war was in the outcome of the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of therapies in the ' civilized world', please have no peaceful angle remained.
Despite the general disaster, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of equal partner.
In such conditions, the only Union in our country remains float and army.
The strengthening of the military power will allow Moscow to make national interests more effective and to get out of new global policy.
Shotland Callum Skinner is moving on the finish line, and the British people are taking a big gold
The Scottish Calum Skinner was moving to triumph in a man's order pressure at Rio's last night, resulting in which the British Trio protected his title from London in 2012.
The 23-year Glasgo's birthday was in the role of the best of his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young Gordo entered the story in the final line to get out of the fabric team from New Zealand.
British stated the right to unexpected winning four years ago when Hoy declared the right to the fifth of his six Olympic Golden Mediums.
And they repeated the truck, after finishing six shortly on the March Championate of the world on the trailways in London, despite that Hoy had completed the career since that time.
The question between Pekin and London was replaced by the specialist of Jamie Staff.
They did the same time when Hindes appeared.
The Login of Hoja also created an empty that Kian Emaddy and Ma Crempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British trainers, seeing the potential in Scotland, which was now disappointed.
Heindes, Kenny, champs with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympian record in the kwality, but the standard was overcome in the first round.
And the British Trio wined a dual for gold.
He's been right behind his circle, but Kenny's running the team forward, and Skinner's supported.
The change was a major part of the transaction, where Hindes went to the greater transfer to disturb and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep the temperature.
He watched from his place as an invited expert BBC and viewed Skyner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered into the pigestal.
23-year Skinner from Glasgo said, "This is a forest comparison."
I'm here to do everything possible and make my name.
We set the Olympics record in the final and won the world's campaigns.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012 with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes recognized intelligently falling after a failure start.
He later refused to comment, and it was not a way to give appeal from the concurrents of the United Kingdom.
There was no such question this time in the biggest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like London, with all the flags of the United Kingdom in the court."
We're all like a team in the last three months.
We played a lot of trailers with the world's name that the winning of the olympide was just a bit of a bit.
It's one business, one golden medal for the country, who wined seven of the 10 named footnotes, both in Pekina and in London.
If this is a barmeter of progress made in the last five months, then the wheel waits for five more successful days.
With the form shown by Kenny, it is not in the way he repeated the Hoy's move, wining three Olympian golden medals in some games.
It would be possible to see Kenny, who was 12 years older than Hoja, who also became born 23 March (that is, a celebrated date in British, which is also the day of birth of Steve Redgrey, Mo Farah and Roger Banister) leads to six golden medals and one silver.
It would also be like Hoy.
Kenny's next time is in the press, which begins today and is spent for three days.
The 28-year-old exit from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this now.
Commands are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's a little alone, if it's honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two other golden medals, he has to get rider."
It was the only day for medals, but it was the following good news for British.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clinsey, Stephen Berk and Owen Doll are qualified by the fastest four miles of trigger.
They're finisher at 3:51.943.
The peace record established in the winning of gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 dinner) are being today, the second day of business, where Wiggins will be in the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday, in order to deal with the quantity of an injury when the leaders needed to measure its weight.
In the relevant women's activities, which will be renewed and ended tomorrow, Laura Trot, Joan Roussel Chand, Ellinor Barker and Cathy Archibald from Milngavia, have improved the world record at 4:13.260.
The British Commander came to believe that the potential team of whales is to take the medium-term of the Olympics games and to take some medals.
After extreme demonstrations of full prevalence in Pekina and London, the expectations were weak in progressive preparation for Rio.
There were dramas on the second plan, not after the exit of the position of the Technical Director of Shane Sa'on in April because of accusations in the sect and pressure, and the outcome of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the start of the first evening on the wallroom, that now the annual britain's glory is at the time to reach the top may be as soon as it will be again.
The future portland metalurg of the electricity insurance is threatened because of the distortion of electricity contract
The future Portland Aluminium Trade in Victoria, as well as the centuries of slaves, is threatened because the electrical company, which provides a carriage, is intended to distort the provisions contract: it is planned that all contracts of supply be distorted.
This step is the consequence of the decision taken before this year by the Government of Victoria to not extend the subsidies provided for for support for the functioning of the defence.
The fixed subsidie for 20 years goes out in November.
Up to 2.000 slaves may be threatened by Alcoa company in Portugal.
A total of 2.000 slaves — directly and indirect — may be risked by any closure.
It can also be added to covering effects, since the metalurgical injury consumes about 10 per cent of the entire electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, the Alcoa company closed the metal-urgy campaign in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the electricity in England last year.
Alcoa's Portland Metalurgical carrier loses money and risks closing.
These actions have become a thrilled consideration of the future insurance, continued a few years ago, especially by the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and more delightedly, because of the price of the production of the debt.
The AGL company, which provides a major aluminium electricity engine with its Loy Yang A electricity in Latrobi-Wally, reported that it expects that three other owners will also take steps to distort the agreement.
The controller of the ship belongs to the joint short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp belongs to smaller parts.
"The AGL company expects that the Portland object continues to work, meaning that the physical question of electricity from the metalurgic station will not be interrupted," she said.
According to the AGL company, the contracts have been contracted are such as the ' elected contracts ' to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month dilution period, so they are actually finished in 2017.
"In accordance with the AGL company still expects that these contracts will bring their part of income in the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
Whatever the potential impact on the arrival of the AGL company starting since 2018 in the financial year, the prognoses on the market of fuckers for optical energy prices have been made.
The AGL company stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its report to 187 million dollars as a "continuing distortion".
According to Alcoa, the decision to distort the contracts "not affects Alcoa's ability to manage metal-surgery or to facilitate the supply of electricity on the metal-urgy station".
The American company stated that in 2010 Loy Yang had concluded a twenty-year contract that had to enter into force in November of this year, but she still needed to explain why she had distorted the contract.
Analytics were threatened by the possible closure and the Portland Metalurg of Victoria and Tomago at Newcastle because of a disadvantaged economic situation in adults.
By turning to analyses previously this week, AGL Stephen Michaelsen's exploitation service said that Portland is using about 600 megavats of energy every year, and Tomago is about 900 megavats.
If both of these injuries are out of the market, there will be a significant reduction in the market [electricity].
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only a star-shoo Cardassian, Kendall on the head of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of the Cardassian-Jenner's mother manager of Chris, appeared at the headquarters of September of the Vogue American magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder board and the defil of the mode in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in its account in Instagram on Thursday.
"When I'm in the stone together with my favorite people, I'm looking at this cloud and weeping," says Kendall.
The news on the surface was strange (or simply in the spirit of the Cardassian family), prepared by video, in which all the Cardassian-Jenner's family (deboshire Rob and Caitlin, also joined them the most favorite grandfather of the Shaw Business, the manufacturer of the Cardashian family, Ryan Sicrist), forgot the appearance of the sister in the area, and finally classic turn: they are a festival-surprise plan.
This is a standard strict line of nearly all the episodes of the television shows dedicated on the day of birth (Cirest refers to the phrase "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the sincerity of a multilingual cross from the program on 8th morning), but Chris needed that this glory might be obtained to others.
Because with this episode, dedicated to the Septuagint Vogue, we certainly entered the new epoch of the Cardashian show.
Let the older sister Kendall Kim fall on the Vogue area before (he appeared on it with her husband Canye West in April 2014), but the September magazine is its own achievement.
The issue of September is the most sold issue of Vogue per year.
A larger number of reclaimers is likely to be given more than to the modern magazine, and the issue is attached to a large quantity of reclaimers (in the calculation of Fashionist port, 615 pages of the previous 832-page issue contained an advertising).
The news of the stars who will be on his side is expected with such insatisfactory that in the last two years the magazine has been sent to the official announcement.
In the number of previous women, Pope's on the floor, Naomi K'Pbell, Linda's Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In the last years, there was no doubt more "significants working by models" than "modells I've been acquired of."
Laureat's premium "Oscar" and the face of Dior Jennifer Lawrence's border was presented in 2013, a year after this honor was deceived by Lady Gage.
But even in that smallest case, if Jenner, who described as a "exhibiting model" of her generation, falls into the first category, it is in a bad company.
These are not my families of people, stars of shaw or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (Jenner falls in all these categories).
These are actually talenting women who are endeavoring to the divorce industry.
This year was one of the most successful in the career in relation to the Lemonade album.
Of course, it's not all good for Jenner's success.
The situation of Jenner in the world of the mode, because of her past television-shoo star, it must always have been to be a treasure.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret Stephanie Samur discovered Jenner and her colleague, Jidge Hadid, who called them "sockets at the moment".
These constructions were rebuilding after the news of Jenner's occurrence in Vogue's area.
But there is no meaning to be involved in the deficiency.
Kendall Jenner on the board of September Vogue.
It is a supermodel in all the senses of this word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, as well as all her sisters, sells your graphs in its same applications available on the signature.
She sells the self-handed graphs to the daughter Crawford of the LOVE magazine.
And in a free time, maybe, to continue to see her sister Cortney and her children, she learns to show TV.
Common legal centres reject 160 000 persons per year
Each year, more than 160 000 least protected representatives of the population refuse to serve in public legal centres, since this sector is prepared for the effect that will show a further decline in the area of activity and that is already conducted.
In Queensland, three of the five persons — mainly, elderly, immigrants, unprotected slaves, victims of violence, people who have no opportunity to face injustice and so far – have already been rejected by trying to get free legal assistance and representation.
Communities of legal services already working on the areas of Property are prepared for further reductions.
Since June of the year, these legal centres must lose more than 30 per cent of federal employment.
The Director of the Community Legal Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that a report of the last report of the National Association of Communities of Legal Centres has been rejected for thousands of people per year.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government's decision was not canceled, the situation would only be disrupted.
"The public legal centres of Queensland continue to receive inadequate performance: that means that thousands of people receive a refusal in their lively important services," he said.
People who come out of the architecture, people with uncontrolled and devastating abilities, families who go through divorce, unjustly dismissed slaves — all of these people have problems of legal nature, and this report shows that they cannot gain help in which they need.
The Federal Government will determine 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of smaller protected people of Queensland will have to resolve complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister for Justice and Senator Quinsland, George Brandis, to cancel these reductions immediately so that people can receive appropriate assistance when they have legal problems.
In the past year, the Government has fulfilled its commitment to enhance the free legal aid to the average country indicator.
It has now been time to take attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their customers, and the Government of Palestinian government has to be involved in this important.
The pre-selected staff Donald Trumpa was sent to court after it was approved to threatened by the gun
According to New York reports, Donald Trompa was sent to the pre-selected staff: as it is said, the stab did nothing after the report that his operating director in North Carolina threatened the gun when they went to Jeep in February.
The incident was described in the court of the State in the Middle Court of Charlotte Vincent Bordin, an ex-engine and a programming ensuring officer in the preliminary state.
Bordin said he had waited for a few months to solve the problem in the internal order, but he realized that "it will not happen."

By accusing the pre-selected and regional administration, Bordin realized that at least four more people were participants of similar incidents with Philly, it was approved in turn.
"Shoots don't have to be able to cause damage," said Bordin in the complaint.

The pre-selected stab Trompa said that the MIs had exposed its words from the context and that he had not been expressed in support of violence.
In its complaint, Burdin requires compensation from the pre-selected staff for non-speed control and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, for the Property and for the cause of morality.
The Representative of Trumpa Hoop Hix has the answer to the request to give a comment.
The trials to talk to Philly have not been married with success.
WCCB, a news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip was recently out of the pre-elected state.
In response to the call in his consular company, the Innovation Consulting Services, no one has revoked quickly.

Britain must put the olympical spirit into the needed round and expand the Hytrou
Hitrou will also bring back and flow not only in our proper population and in the whole of London but also throughout the country.
As I think, this was exactly the great advantage of Hitrous, just as it was with London 2012, where we had all efforts to benefit our people and regions from the game.
The Olympics have benefited greatly for Stratford and Ist-Endo.
And we'll do this again by creating opportunities for people and company around Hitro.
Only for our accurate population items, we will create 10 000 new stages, 40 000 new slaves and end the youth without the airport around.
As before London 2012, those who believe that the Hitrous extension task is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for Olympian games and that we would be in the world's business situation.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will prove their mistakes in the conduct of Hitrou.
There are always obstacles that must be overcome, but Hitrou answers any question.
According to the Olympics Hytrou Game, it is an infrastructure project for most people, not only for a busy circle.
Extension is the opportunity to create up to 180 000 new slaves, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, allowing the inheritance of sciences and occupation around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a team in Hitrou, which introduced the programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure, at the time and in the budget, from T5 is the best terminal of the airport for five years, before T2, built in the middle of the two most occupied in the world.
They are now ready to provide a third aeroplane station under 16 billion pounds of private investments.
The Olympics in London 2012 were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I am sure the extension of the Hytrou will also be.
It has been time for us to put the Olympian spirit into the needed round and expand Hitrou, ensuring our trade future and creating an inheritance of sciences and employment that British people will be encouraging.

Adblock Plus, Facebook plays "musk" on the blocking of the reklame
For companies who work money on the Internet reclaims, trying to provide a program for the blocking of the reclaims, it is a game in the "shot-shot", according to one of the companies that create such software.
Thursday, literally in a few days after Facebook announced that he was going to lock the advertisers on his desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus op rep replied in the blog that users could update their filters in the program to lock the advertising in the network again.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that the stage version of the site changes the wheel around its advertising so that the lockers of the advertising may become more difficult to recognize what parts of the pages I'm being conducted as reclaims.
But Adblock now states that he's got to join a new code.
In his blog, the Representative Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of fight between the blocking community with the open source code and those trying to join it continues from the time of the blocking of the advertising," and maybe Facebook will make its own decision in the next time.
The fact that the world's most important network has entered into the fight is evidently a sign of the major problem of the reklame blocking for industry.
Over the world, about 200 million people are using the locking of the reclaims of the previous year study of Pagefair and Adobe; nearly four times more than those who believed that such programming was provided in 2013.
With the account of 1.3 million everyday active users in Facebook through the mobile devices, the mobile advertising now includes 84 percent of Facebook incomes from the advertising.
However, the company is on the clusters of the reklame on a table version, since the phones of the locker is ineffective in Facebook's mobile applications for the network and the Institute, according to the representative's words.
However, the advertising in the table version represents a sufficient income article to make Facebook a step in such a profitable investment.
On Thursday Facebook also announced that it was going to renew its "recovery preferenties" tool to provide people more control over how the advertising is acquired.
On Thursday Facebook stated that new Adblock filters call anxiety, because they will also block some non-relevant content on the website.
"This will not be a local experience for people, and we will plan to resolve this problem," said the Facebook representative in an official electronic letter.
Blockers are a cruel tool, so we have focused on the creation of instruments such as the Reklame Preferences to translate the management into the hands of people.
The woman was moved to the Swiss autoway in an evidence of self-sufficiency.
The yellow was on the way in the middle of the night.
The police calls witnesses after the woman has moved several vehicles on the road early on Thursday in an evident self-mord trial.
The incident occurred to A1 near Morge in Canton In a midnight after Thursday.
The woman was on the road in the darkness of the deceasedness, and it was struck by several vehicles, reported by the police in the statement.
Clearly, by trying to kill himself, the victim, the Swiss woman at 49 years of age, struck several vehicles, including the carrier.
She died on the wedding.
Some of the leaders have already been asked, but the identity of some of them has not been established, a police who calls them and someone else who was a witness to the event has been rejected.
A "logical" step in such a situation was raised, said Gile Hofsteter Le Tribune de Geneve.
Nevertheless, it is still necessary to find out whether some of the leaders in question would be in charge.
Did it be possible to escape the attack?
"This is what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the last five years have been allowed to assume that the drivers will not be recognised as responsible.
In any case, both of which the input of a person in the darkness of the car was sentenced that the cars could not expect an accidental meeting with the passenger in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
In the past year, the officer was justified by the cause of improving death after she struck and killed a person at A1 near Pierne night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drinked and lost the knowledge of the road, listened to the court.
The Court discovered that a police woman, who responded to an extreme call, managed by a vehicle that was based on, and that the nature of a person on the road was "a perfectly exclusive and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Someone who holds an insult on the event on Thursday near Morge must call to the field by 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Cly Classic NASA Model: Venera was ever inhabited
Venera may have ever been a resident, assessed the new NASA model.
Students from the National Institute of World Study of Goddard have multiplied the model to investigate the past Vener, showing instruments and algorithms similar to those used by climate.
The model was designed to determine whether Vener, with its bitter waterless surface and atmosphere transplanted by oxygen gas, could ever be disabled by conditions like the earth.
Scientists previously assumed that the small speed of Venus return was explained by its fleshly atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Veneror may have been able to have a district atmosphere like the earth, and still turn along.
The model also reviews the topografie of early Venice.
On the planet, probably, there were more surrounding regions than on Earth, but sometimes there was enough water and geographical variability to create conditions for life and to prevent rapid equipment.
Earlier Venere also benefited the sun, which was 30 per cent of the tuscle.
"The GISS model explains that the long return of Venera is presenting its daily sun side for nearly two months once," explained the report for the printing of the GISS Anthony Del Henio.
This combines the surface of the planet and produces a rain that creates a thorough layer of clouds, which is a zone that protects the surface of the planet from the earlier part of the sun heat.
The result of the average climate temperatures, which, as amazing, are some degrees more cold than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venerus, like the development of the former planet study specialists.
Despite the fact that Veneer had ever been inhabited, she had been exercising too large wound and ultraviolet exhibition during several billion years.
Her oceans were spent and her water couple was burned with ultraviolet election.
When its water was flying, only a fleshly atmosphere from a oxygen gas with a rough parking effect was Vener, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venera in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves a post-leader of the Avalanche team
Patrick Roy left the post of the trainer and the vice-president of the Colorado Avalanche Hockey activity on Thursday, with the failure of impact during the decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President/Chapter of the Kolorado team Jo Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club would start searching a new trainer immediately.
"In the last three years, I fulfilled my responsibility to the main trainer and vice-president of the Hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche with energy, ability and determination," said the 50-year Roy in the statement.
During the years, I thought so much about how I could improve this team to give her the depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the trainer and the vice-president of the Hockey activities should be perfectly compatible with the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote when decisions affected by the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at this time.
Sakik, who took Roy on 23 May 2013, welcomed Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we want him to succeed in the future.
Roy’s premium by Jack Adams Award as the best ligue trainer during his first season with the team of Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He brought the club to 112 eyes and wins in the Central Division, but Colorada was devastated by Minnesota in the first round of play-offs and played play-off last two years.
The Avalanche committee announced 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016, and at five points the Wild team for the second fair road to participate in the West Conference.
The brother from the Slave Hall, Roy won four Kubka Stanley — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
Northern Sea petroleums renewed negotiations and stopped the battle
The workshops on the payment of oil in the North Sea have been stopped, and all parties of the discussion access to the new round of negotiations reported by the leading representatives of the parties.
The counterparty of the Wood Group's Nightener company were associated with the North Sea in Royal Du Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT Unions may confirm that we have agreed to renew negotiations for the permit of the currents," states the joint declaration.
We will take a few meetings a full day for several weeks, starting from the beginning of the week, to look at the problems of fresh view.
Professions reported that their recent action, which, according to them, was the first of over 25 years, had been addressed against the potential reductions of the payment to up to 30 per cent.
The Wood Group has decreased the taxes paid by contracting workers in the North Sea in this year by approximately 9 per cent due to the negative pressure of the market.
The reduction of the tax from the company has occurred after 10 per cent reduction in contractual employees in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will give her the space necessary to overcome the market fall.
Shell's company, from its side, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop petroleum activity in countries until 10 because it rationalised its activity by the British Energy Energy BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the underlying prices for unclean oil: the economic situation has been distorted because of the decision to get out of the Union adopted in June of the United Kingdom.
The Scotland member of Dave Anderson's Parliament met with Professional leaders this week earlier to discuss one of the major working conflicts arising in the North Sea in the epoch.
The North Sea said that it was vital for regional economy.
"In the North Sea, even throughout the country, we need an economy that would work for most, not only for some," he said in the statement.
Less than 1.4 billion dollars for new projects in the North Sea are expected in 2016, in contrast with a average value of about 7 billion dollars in the past five years.
Ca is measured by the speed of turning the stars to the Playd
After the mission of the Telescope Space, the Ke'ar helped the astronoms to collect the fullest catalogue of the stars in the Plaids.
The new data helped astronoms to understand why the stars are rotated with different speeds, as well as the turning periods are related to the design of the planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," is the report for the printing of Louis Ribal, the Scientific Centre of Infrastructure and Analysis of the California Technology Institute.
The Flood is located in 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in ScoC now have only reached adults; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're turning so quickly as they'll never be.
At their big speeds of turning these adult stars have a large number of star winds.
By traveling through the stars fields, these winds show the stars a covering.
As long as the star is old, its rotation speed begins to be disturbed.
Ca measures the speed of the turn of each star, following the time between the occurrences of the known star five, such as the solar fifth.
The new Rotation Directory suggests that more massive stars turn alonger than less massive stars.
Ribal compares the stars with the dancers: more majors make pirouetes slower than smaller.
"In the "balet" we observe that those who turn slowly are usually more massive, while those who turn faster are usually related to very easily stars," said Ribal.
Since Playad's screen is so close, it is a ideal space for the lab to compare the features of the stars with the speed of return.
"Pleada's star-scale provides a post point for the theoretical models of the stars and younger and older ones," says Race Ribal.
We still want to know how, where and why the stars swimming the speed of their turning and weeping their "dancewa" tuffle on the wheel.
Ribal and her colleagues have detailed their last analysis of Played's turnover in three new articles, which will soon be listed in the Astronomy magazine.
The investigation of the Ucrainian Diversants in Crime is conducted by two experts, says "Commercent."
The FSB collects evidence of the detained participation in preparing divergences in Crime.
As reported earlier, you recognize the witness of the Ukrainian city of Energodar of the Panes who agreed to cooperate with the consequences.
According to his statement, he considered the "Titan" hymnical in Armensk, the petroleum in the Federation, the Kerchen pardonation, the gas management, and one of the military aircrafts.
The rightsguardians believe that it has not been able to detain all divergences far away.
This has, in particular, been the response for the arrest of the suspicious in the Kiev Riddle of Simferopol.
Main trainer of Russia on football
At the meeting of the assembly of the Russian football Union, a decision was taken to be appointed to the main trainer of the Russian congregation at Stanislove's football of Cherches.
The contract with it will be calculated for two years before the end of the CM-2018.
On 11 August, the RFS was assigned to the post of the main trainer of the Russian congregation by Stanislav Cherches' football.
This is a former footballist playing in the Moscow "Spartake" position, as well as a trainer with a solid experience, who was a teacher of Russian teams such as "Spartak", "Jamchujina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dinamo", as well as the Barshaw Legia, who became a winner of the national primacy and the cow of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchew will be signed at the nearest time and shall be calculated for two years.
Thus, he has the obligation to prepare a collection for the world campaign in 2018.
It is known that the Miroslav Romanjanko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panics, will be entered into his training station.
There are information on which the payment of the whole train station is 2.6 billion per year.
According to the MMI, the leadership of the FS has set the aim of bringing Russia to half-final and acquiring medals before Stanislaw.
As the trainer himself said, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and will give the footballists the opportunity to show himself.
Also, according to Cherches's words, he's glad that the choice fell on him.
The first staff under the leadership of Church's assembly will take place 31 August in Antal, which will be a companion meeting with the Turkish team.
On the previous post of the Russian main trainer of football, Leonid’s employee was involved in the CSCA club.
He declared his department from the posts after the statement of the Russian National Team in France to 2016.
In addition, he took responsibility for the bad results of the collection.
The attack between Angola and UNAR was very suffering during the long fight against the apartment.
However, after the income of independence from Southern Year in 1990, this country with a population of 2,4 million has reached great success, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government gives great attention to education.
While people in developed countries consider themselves free primary and average education, many poor countries in the middle and even early schools require training.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce training for " expenses".
However, training in early schools in Namibia is free.
Moreover, the average education has become free since 2015.
The authorities also work actively in other important ways.
The effort to promote has reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent in the past ten years.
Despite the international tendency to grow in the inequality, it is reduced in Namibia.
In comparison with the 1993 indicator of Coffee Gini, which is the standard indicator of the income non-equality, was decreased at 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this indicator was one of the highest world.
And the poverty level was reduced from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people in extreme poverty (not less than $1,90 per day) has also been reduced, with almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia is also the highest in the review of the freedom of the word, given " Reporters without the border."
The country has highly prejudiced the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable review - one of the highest in the " Index of corruption" - which consists of Transparency International Rights Protectors.
Even now, when the prices are understood, Namibia is able to maintain high levels of growth.
At the same time, the BDP ' s level is about 25 per cent, which consists of less than 1/3 levels in the United States and most of the Peace countries.
Of course, there are some problems in Namibia.
The level without a level, at least by traditional methods, continues to be sufficiently high - nearly 28 per cent.
Like other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS disease in Namibia is nearly 17 per cent of the population that I have been infected.
According to the evaluations of the World Bank, Namibia has been held to a number of countries with a higher average income, but the authorities claim that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia is obviously concerned with some difficulties that are involving economics.
The State must develop a very large and embarrassing country with a small population.
In the country's territory in the wilderness, isolated kitchen tribes of collectors, which should be integrated in the present society without the loss of their identity.
The integration of people who have been in the world economy in the fourth century ago is an uncomfortable task for any country.
For Namibia, it is even more difficult: as any other country in the world, it is affected by the consequences of climate change.
Nevertheless, Namibia did not think to lay hands out, but the country decided the problems before it.
Almost after obtaining independence of the authorities, the creation of a diversified economy and a common society.
It is noteworthy that competitive political fractions were gathered together to work for all goods.
In fact, Namibia provides hard medical services not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbors.
Approximately 15-20 per cent of the visitors of the Medical Institute in the North regions of Namibia, Angola citizens.
No one in Namibia refers to the building of a wall that would have a country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that the neighbors were not choosing and therefore decided not to cope with them, but to share in deficit water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to promote investment and exchange students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia has justified that rich natural resources can be easily cursed by encouraging a few for many.
The authorities understand that income from Namibia's natural riches must be contributed to infrastructure and industrial powers.
They also recognize that it would be unresponsibilityless to avoid obtaining a maximum arrival from the country's sales of resources, and review investment laws and contracts for acquisition to ensure that it is so.
Transparency has a determinant importance for this process, therefore strong support by the Government of freedom of word is so important.
As the Chapter of Hague Gaingob noted, the MMI often say what he doesn't like.
But after fighting for the freedom from the apartment in the Southern Namibia must protect the freedom received, states the President.
Not all the key resources of Namibia I'm expelled.
The Government is such as fishing - relates to the renewable, and the Government is taking all efforts to maintain and strengthen them.
Each year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries starting with serious deficiencies of racism, employment, inequality and low development may be in a way to general flowing.
Her achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard about the Golden Warna - the former gold objects created by humans (4600 to 4200 years before our era).
Please, this was the biggest ecological session of 1970s: in Bulgaria, when the Barnean Necropoles were cut off, the number of gold artefacts was found in more than three thousand total weights of 6 kg.
Only one of the preservation, which is "movil No. 43", was made of 990 gold objects by over 1,5 kg.
However, the official status of the former world’s gold can soon go to the invisible type of busin found by the geologists in July of this year.
In Bulgaria again, it is a history of the population, such as the Tell Younacy.
In contrast to Varna, the port town, Tel Younaci is remote from the sea, near the village of Younaci in the Pazardjic region.
The business is a golden plague that is turned into the ring.
Javor B'Žijev, a concealer in the Tell of Younacy, dated 4600 years before our era and stated that it was a higher gold of Varna for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, on the same time, are dated about 4600 to 4200 B.C.E.
Technology that allows the metal to be dated without prejudice does not exist now.
How, then, is it confident that what gold is more ancient?
Professor B'Živ knows obviously more than he reported to the Agency Reʹs: "I am fully sure the gold of the Younaci is greater than the gold of Varna."
It's an exceptional importance: it's a nice object, but it's enough to take a similar place in the history.
The Interview reported that scientists in the nearest time analysised the sum of metals and re-examined the geological layer where the gold artefact was found.
This will help to date the bus with the maximum accuracy possible.
The place of finding also explains much.
The Tell Younaci is a village known, even if you never heard about it.
The Tell Younaca is now considered an ancient "town" of the city.
Tel was the descendants of people, the migration of the Anatolia (the modern Turkish) in 7 thousand years before our age.
In the past centuries, the region has developed a cruel development of metals, from the creation of the first metallurgical habits to the creation of a full-valuable industry.
The patriotic history for this geological community contains a name: Ba’s Carpatic Metalurgical Province.
In five thousands of years before our era around the metal centers, the city of the city of the city began to be inhabited.
They are now called ancient cities.
Of them, the Tell Younaci may be the oldest, since there were artefacts found here in 4900 B.C.E.
I would call Tel Younaci prototi of the modern city, although it's a very old village, even compared to the opotomia.
"This is the place for a thousand years older of Shumer," says B.J., as a generally adopted view that the city culture was born in the south, the modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the usual understanding of this word.
The decades of Tell Younaci have been carried out since 1976.
At this time, the geologist rasko is nearly 12 hectares, which is about the third of the general area of residence.
The rest of the strong wall was found, which sometimes reached three meters high.
The houses and the masters were shortly stored, but the geologists were clearly different from the street, public opinions, the citizen's body building, the "partial center" and the living areas.
The Tell of Younaci often calls "Flying City": There were found tens of lying birds.
All birds were represented in the room, and there was a view that they were not decorative but the object of the coal.
The "Old City" was disrupted about 4100 years before our era - perhaps by the Indians from the north-east tribes.
There were no towns, so there were ships and weapons.
Three meters of strong walls have not stopped them.
Archeologists found evidence of a violent fight: inside the houses were found residues of elderly, women and children with the sequences of hurt made by fighting topores.
New income and new facts are shown annually by changing the habitual views of the ancient history of the universe.
Bulgarian geologists are not often talking about separate cultures, but about the "potterial" first civilization of the Bâ’s birth.
A strong stimulation in seeking this civilization became " the gold of Varna", which was recently found in 1972.
It's logical that the golden rose of Varna should have been something before, something like a cross-good bag created in the Tell of Younacy.
In Porsche, the model 911 Targa was experiencing
Officially it is stated that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted by manual department specialists working with series of machines.
"Retro-luk" is, for example, in the color of Etna Blue, which has been multiplied in 1960 for porsche 356B models, in this colour, even the logo of the model.
Furthermore, the tax has received a firmly white graph at the boards and 20-digit road disks RS Spyder, as well as some details of the white-good metal.
It is not less in the interval: it is, in large account, distinguishing the gamma-blue, new grades with expanded electrical regulatory areas and the black-noded roads with the department logo.
Furthermore, when buying a version, each purchase will receive a chocolate for car and a richly acquired album with the production process graphics.
The powerful establishment of porsche Exclusive specialists was not to be drawn: the retro-tax of characteristics is completely compatibil with the series.
It is based on a six-linder engine with a turbonaid volume of 3.0 l developing 420 PM and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S is able to take up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued by a tissue, but no value of any specific sport is reported.
Facebook and the lockers of the advertising were connected to "inflammation trace"
Recent introduction of the Facebook technology, which prevented the hiding of the public on the Society pages, results of the decision-making decisions to block responsible actions.
AdBlock Plus has been released "opposition", but Facebook is planning to do it as well.
So AdBlock Plus prophecies is its new technology, which, mostly, remains effective a little.
The Society representatives noted that by trying to defeat the new "never-blocked" reklame technology, AdBlock Plus decisions and commercial declarations blocks many normal posts from friends or pages.
In Facebook, the AdBlock Plus policy was deceived and promised to solve the problem.
As the source has told among the TechCrunch edition, the code that makes AdBlock Plus free on the Facebook desktop will be ready for the next hours.
Thus, the sockets and lockers were binding on their kind of "once of weapons" by trying to play one another, which was the same as the damage, became users who lost interesting records from friends or seeing the advertising where they were not used to see it.
Ethical and the locking of the reclaims recently causes bitter disputes.
In Murmansk, the violenceer will stand before the Court of Nocturn Murmansk.
It has already been concluded to investigate in the Following Committee of the Russian Federation on the March.
The accusation of 54-year-old man is very serious to conclude sexual characteristics.
Consequently, at the end of November 2015, Paul's accused street in Murmansk had acted sexually with violence against 20 years of age.
The sanction referred to in this article provides a maximum penalty for the detention of freedom for six years.
Dongfeng brings Crosswan Fengguang 370 to Russia and Picape Rich New website At www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of a popular population in China, which consists of the dignity of a minivan and crosssour.
Another stated Russian premier is Picap Rich New.
Many western companies of Moscow’s car salon have decided to ignore this year, so the exhibition of Cross Expo will fill the Chinese firms.
In particular, the powerful front will present the corporation of Dongfeng Motor, which has large types of Russian markets and which is in the nearest future to offer to our self-fairs a number of interesting news.
One of them will be a crosswan Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which is sold in China for the price of 55 900 Juan (at least 550 thousand rubs at the current course).
The Russians have been able to be able to be able to see whether there is a question of stages in the country until there is a discussion stage.
In China, mostly, Fengguang 370 per june sales were able to reach the 11th place in the list of the most sold miniatures, despite a large road light (175 mm) and a protective plastic volume on the lower perimeter of its cuses can be completely calculated to crossmore.
Crosswan is built in a youngest Fengguang model for 360, 370, the same road base at 2725 mm, but the cows are almost longer (4565 mm against 4510 mm), the design is slower, and the foundation is richer.
Salon was covered by trees, but the large vertical sensor screen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibitions of crossven, and in the sale, the "music" cars were easier.
Five of the seven seats are easily composed by creating a grade of 1650 mm long, the maximum amount of the bathroom is 1500 l.
The Fengguang 370 motor is only one - 1,5 litres of the benzine "atmosphernic" power 115 p.m., consisting of a 5-grade mechanism of transfer.
The manufacturer of the machine’s dynamic quality decreases strictly, so it promises that the lowly owner's budget is at a level of 6,7 l/100 km.
Picape Rich New is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navar of a requested generation, but with almost the Chinese stylists design.
Despite morally older, this model is used by the Chinese consumer as a trustworthy and unfair "working wound".
At the equivalent price, Rich New is probably interested in the Russian, because modern Japanese picks have become very precious.
Rich New is based on two motors on a choice: 2.4 l (137 l.c.) or a turbodizele of 2.5 l (116 p.m.).
The transfer box is only a mechanism, the carrier is on the back of the road, but there's a mode and a heavy "forward".
It will be on the Wall Dongfeng and the new Flagman seat A9, its Russian Premier representation of the Chinese company anonso still in June.
Minvenous crossveres on the Chinese market become more, one of the last news -- Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The Russian Dongfeng line now consists of two models: S30 and H30 Cross.
In the seven months of this year, the Chinese company's diler in 696 cars in our country.
Reports on the transport tax will be stopped by sending a mail site on www.zr.ru
The tax inspection has changed the range of notifications on property taxes.
All Russian auto-governmental authorities have used a scheme that has not changed years: they receive a year and ace for a shortly-qualitative quantity for transport tax payment in the previous year.
However, many will not expect them this year.
The fact was that the tax inspection had changed the order for citizens to notify.
Those who are registered in the "Financial Office" on the official website of nalog.ru reports will be reported in the electronic form.
Inspections automatically included such Russian online-operators and removed them from the standard, "booming" distribution.
The newness will be covered by all owners of vehicles and inmobility.
The rest of these will continue to receive normal letters.
However, the opportunity to return to the old scheme is also available to the owners of accounting on the website.
They will have to visit the tax service during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and appropriate.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" contrast after the construction, while the letter will go a few days and can be lost.
The additional number of users of the Internet service was over 18 million people that would allow the public to severely check on the mail.
On the other hand, the modesty news on the site of inspection is evidently not enough to inform the citizens of the changed order.
They could be registered in the "personal office" for a single-time service and have forgotten it for a long time.
These people will not expect reports on the road, and they will fall into the category of non-paymenters with all the results that run out.
Access to the "Financial payment office" is three ways: by the account of the gosuslugi.ru port, using the electronic signature or entry of the login and password specified in the register card.
The last can be obtained in any exercise of tax inspection (independent of the position to account).
We note that the transport tax must be paid until 1 December.
The race of notifications began in July.
Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which it is intended to achieve a very high delivery, is something in itself.
But the concept was not disturbed by G-Power's masters who took the Mercedes-AMG G 63 sports mode.
G-Power is his adventure to the BMW cars, but it's nothing strange to her masters.
