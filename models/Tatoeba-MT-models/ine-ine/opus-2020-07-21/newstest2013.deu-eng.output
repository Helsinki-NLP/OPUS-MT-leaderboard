A Republican area to meet the restoration of Obama
The powers of the Republicans are justified by the need to cope with the choice deficiency.
However, the Brennan Center believes lastly for a mythos, confirming that the choice fraction in the United States is rare than the number of people killed by the attack.
However, in 10 years, the Republican legal advocates have only committed 300 cases of election in the United States.
One is safe: these new provisions will be negative to the election share.
In this regard, these measures are partly subscribed to the United States Democratic System.
In contrast to Canada, the United States of the United States are responsible for the implementation of elections in each country.
In this regard, the majority of the governments have announced new laws since 2009 which have difficulted the procedure for registration or instruction.
This phenomenon was valuable after the elections of November 2010, where 675 new Republican representatives were able to be distributed in 26 States.
Therefore, 180 legal drafts were introduced only in 2011, which restricted the exercise of election rights in 41 countries.
The new election law requires the electoral to present a light image evidence and a evidence of the US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws reduce the periods for the preliminary vote taxation, declare the right to register themselves as electors on the election day, and the State citizens shall decrease the election right for which a court is predicted.
Before the elections of 2006, no US state requested the electors to show a light image show.
Indiana was the first alien state who raised such a request.
In 2008, the General Court Chair of the United States interacted with the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities claimed to extend this practice to other States.
During the last two years, they encouraged the drafts of law in 34 federal countries with which the electors were forced to show a light image.
It is important to note that the United States citizens do not have a universal statement card such as the hospital insurance cards.
In fact, 11% of the US citizens, including 21 million electoral persons, are not a member of the Government of their state.
Furthermore, five million new elections in 2012 have no such statement.
However, more than hundred are often to be sealed in order to obtain the necessary evidence.
From the new restrictions, young people, minorities and low income are unrelatedly affected.
In fact, 25% of the Afro-Amers have, 15% of the people with an income of less than $35.000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the electors between 18 and 29 years are not over the necessary light image evidence.
This is still enough.
The students who are viewed as electors who increase their vote for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their light images issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow the members of Angels or Jagd conferences to choose more for the Republican side to use cards issued by these United States for elections.
Further 2004, no State of State has requested a evidence of the state of citizenship.
It was the first State of the Federation who introduced such a request.
Since 2011, a thousand States have adopted laws which request the electors to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are obvious to limit the Spanish votes.
Because it is in the hand that two of the three Spanish electors prefer the Democratic Party.
Moreover, the Republican legislators in 2011 promoted laws in eight federal states with which the register of electors was made on the election day.
Moreover, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to allow the electors to provide assistance to those who want to register themselves.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for electoral registration in the general elections of 2004 have to register approximately 10 million citizens.
Because the measures provided since 2009 have reduced the share of the registration of new electors in 2010 in comparison with 2006 to 17%.
▪ the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other federal states aiming to reduce the period of vote for the previous vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the electors who had previously chosen, Afro-Amer Others, were only 13% of the electors of the State of the Federation.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
Lastly, only 11% of the electors, but 24% of the citizens who had previously chosen.
On the contrary, the whites represented 76% of the electors were only 46% of the electors who had previously chosen.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their attachers have enhanced the derogation of laws that restrict the registration of electors.
Several legislative projects were blocked by the Vetos of the Democratic Governors.
The General Advocate of the United States has been adopted to implement the most restrictive laws.
You could have limited the damage partly.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal states have adopted laws that require the predictation of an illustration.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will certainly be difficult to exercise election rights.
The democratic critics commit the partipolitical nature of the derogated laws and consider the impact of the results in the states exposed for 2012.
A report from the Brandan Center of 2011 shows that those States who have adopted these laws shall make 171 of the 270 votes necessary in the electoral body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm that these amendments to the election system will have significant effects on the result of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is sure: these new provisions will be negative to the election share.
In this regard, these measures are partly subscribed to the United States Democratic System.
Prostatac rheb identifier: should the test be made or not?
The PSA test is wise in fact, sometimes wrong results, with false negative or but false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to strengthening lowness of the already incomplete men for the implementation of previous recognition tests.
Whether the test should be made or not
We have received the opinion of two experts.
In the United States, there were many set factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another aspect, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a subsequence in the mortality of patients with and without previous recognition.
This area also showed that in a monitoring after 12 years, the probability of training of metastases is about 30 to 40% if no previous recognition was performed.
That is why I recommend the test from a 50-year-old or 40-year-old, when you have a direct friend who had already been infected with prostatac rabs.
In the case of men of Afro-American origin, there is also a risk.
The most important is to take the right decision as soon as a cancer disease has been recognised.
There are types of cancer, aggressive and other indolents.
The patient must really understand the risk of the cancer disease by showing the possible options in which prostatac rabs can remain untreated if he does not affect the life quality in long age, and in these cases, you will be determined for an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer are not being treated because their cancer is not aggressive and no threat to their life.
They are offered a active monitoring and offer a treatment in the progress of the disease.
The criteria for a decision which should be treated and who not should be treated are determined with accuracy.
That is why I recommend the implementation of the test.
The most important, however, is to talk to Ar to decide whether or not.
In cooperation with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed an instrument that can be evaluated the pre- and income of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately there is no wonder to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk to reduce it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move enough.
"If there are no smokers anymore, this value would increase at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, speakers of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by consumption.
Many also remain completely unclean.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against the tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the return of the number of fuckers.
The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of long cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It hurts people's health strongly.
"Today there are 1,5 million fuckers in Quebec," says the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the delay of the cigarette, the risk of cancer is reduced to die for the help.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the overweight and Adi ́as also promote the distortion of illness.
They seem to increase the risk of brush, grim darm, mast darm, speeding, bowling and borrowing cancer.
"The research shows that a regular corporate A's during the whole life against the Grimm Darm Cancer," he added.
The Earth
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In excessive quantities, the risk of bleeding on a cruel or mast-free cancer is increased.
Manufacturers should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drunk or salt can lead to training of carcinogens.
"Later can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamine
In the past years, several professionals have examined the relationship between vitamin rates and cancer.
Your studies are not concluded.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, vitamin E is contrary.
As a result of the reduction of the risk of prostatactic rabs, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer has not yet been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is to speak with Ar about his thoughts and its ambitional pre-load.
"The implementation of a previous identification test does not lead to cancer."
Analysed by Higgs Boson
The announcement of the probably discovery of the Higgs-Bosons has made a certain view in the last summer, and this is because of the reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is shared in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And it is the last part of which the existence of the standard model - our best or "the less false" claim of the nature and the behavior of the material - has been predicted, but has not yet been observed empirely.
But for the physicians it's not completely sure that it's really about the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new part, and that it is strongly similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, this seems to be processed by new data presented in this week on a big physical congress in Kyoto, but there were no data to be completely secure.
Yet, let's avoid that it is actually the Higgs, because it seems to be a small risk to disturb, and let's look at what's going on.
In this world, there is a long-term law inappropriate, which causes two objects not to exist at the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too strong because you will be worried.
For even if the physician is a real strange world, it seems that it also applies to such a law: the Paulian Exclusion Prince, which says that two parts cannot hold the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantity state", where this "status" is in large and full of some of their properties.
From that, physicians share the parts in two categories.
In a corner, the good citizens, who are deceived as Fermione, are obedient to Pauli Prin.
And in the other way, the bosons move themselves, a usual band of anarchists who are nothing -- in any case this Prince, which means that they can find themselves at the same time at the same place.
These bossons, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Labors (there is absolutely surprised) are listed in two groups: the messons that we do not treat here and the "carf parts" through which the large powers of the nature are spread and with which the Higgs-Boson would be related somehow.
But here must be highlighted that these bossons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this history, only thanks to a bosson of extraordinary banality: the photos or the "light parts", which is the "boat" of the electromagnetic power.
If a piece with a electric loading is cleared or changed the direction, the electromagnetic field is exactly "shorted" at this place, as well as a kiesel stone that has been cut into a tick.
This "sühling" produces a electromagnetic wall (Light, Infrarot or Ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wall is nothing but a photo, and thus one of the boss "the power tractors".
Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the sub-sheet, that another field, the Higgs-field, must be "headed" to show this boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the acquirer must get very high energy, a little comparable to a furnishing tear, whose surface could only be destroyed by a very large stone.
It is therefore necessary to make a big parts-scaleer such as the CERN - the large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to get such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is re-helpful to declare the relationship between the higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all parts and not all materials interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnete, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet paper would never be able to keep from itself at the fridge.
Similarly, not all parts interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (as the rest of the photos) do not have mass permissions.
For what can all these research be "good" now, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
They serve the standard model review (SM), and they also enable the physicians to examine all differences between observations and predicts of the SM.
Moreover, there are many physicians who hope that such differences will be found, since the lowest subsequence opens a door to a "new physics" and may stop some layers of the model.
You need to say that the last is still a big deficiency, because there is no bleeding for the gravity (ops!) and the dark material offers approximately 80% of the universe's material (reops!).
However, such differences were not found until now during the CERN.
Effects
The impacts of these research on the general population are more difficult, but it would be wrong to think that there is no gift.
Moreover, in the early 60s, the layer’s pioneers in the Bell Labors did not assume that their work would solve such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the disgusting physician Willard Boyle - who has been in the Bell Labs in which the Laser was found in the 1960s, and who was developed in 1962 himself the first duration class (the first were pulled) - already said that the Laser was seen at the beginning as a "laboratory player".
Imagine...
▪ Applications can also be provided from all the instruments that enhance research.
For example, Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor during his work in the optic.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "auge" and has introduced the Nobel price for physics in 2009.
Of course, this doesn't mean that LHC's Actions will be permanently changed by our life, but it means that you can never know it...
Paperiative agents - the best way to die... 日 Le Devoir
With its Committee on Death in Würde, Quebec discussed recently the heavy question of the lifemaker.
The debate must be repeatedly taken into courts, although a legislative draft is prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to see this closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostatake rab, who took him up, had left him a period of two years.
"You gave me five years of life, I created seven years," he said in bed in the house of Paperative Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he came last night.
"Everyway, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The illness makes their work: an inevitable weakness prevents him from going alone to the toilet and even eating himself.
At the table before a beautiful breakfast, he wants to resign himself to help to eat.
He feels courageous to smile and speak to the strangers who are busy about him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bathroom.
The courage of the usual death.
"My biggest desire is to heal my course because this is humiliating," he shares.
A few hours later, the team found a health tool for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we find out that a man pinks in the stone," Pierre Brodeur, psychology in the home of Victor-Gadbois said.
Return to the childhood phase is an inappropriate humility for certain persons.
"It depends on the ability of the person," he sets a back step.
Because, according to several persons who work in the papperative administration, great events are located in the middle of these steps.
Patients who are listed in the home for Victor Gadbois in Paper-action Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectation of three months.
In this stage, they will not be overcome by the doctors and sisters who care about them with such a "healing" career.
For Lady A., 89 years, the worst care is to die "consciently and by exalting".
But by the illness, I really met my children.
"I've got kids."
"I don't have any desire anymore in my life," she says before she accepts that you set her a mask that helps her in the spirit.
Yet, in the next days, she expects another last ecclesiast of her son, coming from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois, you are offered with a group of voluntary bodies and aid for adoption.
The packaging system will then be used if there are no other options.
To make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec, at 11.700 inhabitants comes a bed for the paper-active officers.
This is very little if you see that we all will die on one day.
Here the life is continued under best possible conditions, explained by Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of He ́.
Soon at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You will ever give the dead a mouth with Brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetes should not control their blood sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of every day.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
Today the morning his son will cut off the beer to the feet of the wound.
"We help people and patients equally," reports Observer Director Nathalie Savard.
In the Victor Gadbois home, there is no day like the other.
Besides a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well founded by his heads, while he is awakened to his honor, a young man of 36 years, who is circumcised by his parents, his wife and his two small children, in a tragic way after he tried to survive everything.
"From six months, three to five beds have always been located with cancer patients in age of less than 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel disappointed.
53% of the patients in Victor-Gadbois home come from their habitats, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to packaging managers
It is said that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to papperative agents, namely to a career that will suffer from patients if they have reached the final stage of their lives both home, in hospital or in a hospital home.
And several organizations such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the company for home paper-active agents in Montreal are specialized more or less on the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great insufficiency in the health care Quebecs ensures that several specialised doctors in the Paperiative League of the derogation of a law on death assistance and assisted suicide are in mind.
Since the month of October, a manifest has been subjected by prominent personalities of the papperative officers such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to announce their opposite to such initiatives.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system Quebecs is not sufficient to ensure that all rights have a high-quality paperactive operation before accepting death assistance.
Shortly ago, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the reception, without taking measures for their lifting.
I fear that the patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predicts until the last day.
The chances of survival of Helene Richard were already minimal when she cancelled a cautious chemotherapy.
When I announced my oncology that I'm gonna cancel the treatment, she answered me that she's suffering that I'm going to fight, she told her.
Yet, she told me I was over!
No all-powerful career
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have requested to die thanks to the supervisory staff that it did not have this desire after their pain has been reduced by a packaging team.
However, it must be clearly stated that the paparative response in the treatment of pain is not all-potensive.
After Elsie Monereau, the leader of the Paperiative Body of the Society of Granra Montreal's home paparative agents does not refer to a pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, the doctors often take back to the terminal sediation that is going out to interfere with the patients or with the time of his death.
We can't do anymore as if we don't see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain bleeding will always have more often the possibility to return to this terminal sediation.
Patients whose pain is not reduced, all the same say, "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean toughly, "I want you to smite me," but "I want my pain to be reduced."
The realisation of this report was possible due to a journalism stipendium of Canadian health research institutions.
Immobilious Chandale large dimensions in Quebec
The staff of the road building, the building company, the political customers and the Italian Mafia's specialists tell each day what they know about a great "system" in the building, officers, officers, officers, workers and mafios.
A "industrie", which was very higher for the tax payer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's wonderful how the system falls since you've taken drastic measures," Jacques Duchesneau, ladies in Quebec and former leader of the police of Montreal.
The scandale was discovered by him due to an incoming investigation of the disorders in relation to the traveling contracts in Quebec, which was only accepted by the former Prime Minister.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and employees.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he states, "the Department of Contracts has solely divided a billion" because some of them were inclined to receive their share!
The Charbonneau Commission has already fallen to two citizens, in the hope that she is able to show the tactics behind the individuals.
A 2011 Called, Permanent Anticorruption Unit
The standing anti-corruption unit called in 2011 also takes great effort with its groups to economic checkers, researchers and analyses of the Government.
◆ the police of the "Marteau Group" that has effected since 2009 that Montreal's "Canalisation Cartel" is going back in the artificial breathing of the contracts...
In the last weeks, she has expressed home investigations and claims for disturbance and corruption against public mandaters such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the citizen of a city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just returned from Property as a citizen of Laval, the largest city of Quebec.
He will be convinced that in exchange for public tasks, it will repeat Smiley payments.
Moreover, the engineers of the road building of Montreal were expressly accused, as well as Italian claims, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
In the last case, the Commission has taken a view by explaining the functionality of the "System" for the receipt of public tasks.
He has payed for several years 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a Mafia-related mediator who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of citizens Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito has had his hand overall in the game by giving more than 88.000 Canadians (approximately 68.000 euros) to provincies, especially to the Liberals that were at that time.
He also agreed to have organized an illegal refund for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalization contracts whose costs have been artificially covered
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked freely.
The former building engineer Gilles surprenant described this explicitly before the Commission: in the years of the construction undertaking he received gifts, invitations to traveling, golf tourners, restaurants and eishockey games, as well as payment payments in the amount of 6.000.
Other staff in the road building office have admitted that they have been smiling by enlarging the accounts with false additional services artificially about 30-40%.
◆ a member of the citizen party, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay, has accused that he has regarded a shadow house which has fed his cakes with black costs.
According to these enthries, Mr Tremblay returned to the beginning of November, what Montreal hit in a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first lawyers of Montreal who killed the alarm.
As citizen of Rivière-des-priries, in the east of the island, she refused from 2010 to purchase a community foundation for 5 million and for 1,6 million builders in the tremendous immobility.
70% black wages in election campaigns
From the study that was last conducted, she says that she is "by a fade that allows it to understand the functioning of the system invasive by ameises to stop the evil and deal with the guilty."
She says that the procedure is " painful, but positive".
However, we are in order to clean the wounds, we need only a certain investigation unit for Montreal, and a view to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on his side, notes that "Administrators have shot several hundreds of millions," but especially thinks about the role of the "Manded players who are in the picture" if they weren't in trouble!
From a share of 70% black costs in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he said, "I was told that this is only a weak decree of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to reduce the S sitting to the parties to 100, which would not change the situation: "When the choices are not limited, the black costs will be in the course of."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the delivery of public tasks and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall deeper; by walking with courage, we can rebuild the house on a solider basis with more controls and laws."
If this story hurts the international view of Quebecs and those from Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau requests those who smile about to put a cup into their own hitherhof...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have adopted a new measure with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can declare it by a personal understanding, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my game level every day.
And in a game this is even easier.
It's going to be very quick in the football.
But I'm not disappointing.
Since my starts in the Centre of Preparing Education of the INF to my game time, I have always progressed gradually.
Therefore, you use the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accessories of this summer are used to play very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is exhaustive.
This leads to a player like me, to offer the bridge and want to give his own.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me much about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti includes all the technicians respected.
In Ligue 1 there is no comparable person currently, and it refers to the best trainers of Europe.
He looks back to a rich experience and has won many titles with looked units.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January, I had a conscious conversation with him.
At that time, I just got up from a series of hurt.
The confidence he set in me is also a claim for my benefits.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the captain.
But we're running in the detention.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have in this way qualified for the 8th final.
What is the aim of the Union in this competition?
We'll try to come as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our worths against a lot of communities.
To this end, we want to be first of our group before Porto so that we can make the back game of the 8th final as a home game.
Can the PSG be a big unit in short view?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a big unit, Paris has to win titles and make a name long-term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG provides the funds in order to adopt specific forms.
Would it be a great mistake to won't win the title in Ligue 1 as this was in the last season of the case?
Of course, this would be a great disturbance.
This year, we really have the heart to dismiss this title.
We were close at the last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to make the winner off.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed 79 points.
Normally, you should be with 79 points master...
But another community, that of Montpellier, has achieved a better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even if the great crowds such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are running the title, I think we have the witness to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that many of us are expected.
We accept this perfectly.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can do, it's a little frustrating.
You're wondering what people still expect.
We could never win every week with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to create a game concept.
A community is building up with time.
In the Champions League, we have proved strong.
Look at Manchester City, a combination of the two seasons has not been able to qualify for the 8th final, and he has also performed great details!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed at the pause of the game with 15 points forward!
This claimed that our enemies and the French mastership would be left without respect.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good at the last season, were "bounded by this new PSG".
This shows that the ligue 1 is stressing.
I hope we will be the laughing winner in May and say that we have won them despite all difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance van Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better to talk about a "Zlatan dependence".
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and proved that he was the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he played, he led before his eyes that he was a great player and a world star.
Inside the community, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders worldwide, also allows all others to make progress.
How did you learn the EM 2012 with the French nationality?
Like a disgusting.
It was my heart to share this EM.
Unfortunately, my damage prevented me from exposing some game time.
I've seen things from which I've been strengthened.
Today I feel like to perform games in the national community.
This was since my baptism with my "Bleus" hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned, and today we have to put an example of behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Blue"?
He has achieved many promised results.
We have a position in the qualification group for the WM.
The Nationaltra is broken, is close to the players and is right to win.
Like Laurent Bla.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Bla facie had reached his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is this a divorced game in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has been used for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never learned a comparable game in my kare.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing operations between participants.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is acceptable: the conviction that the current election system of bankmonopoles leads to financial crisis.
In fact, the Bitcoin found by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonim) is both a wallet (but in, Euro, etc.) as well as a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent that allows direct exchange of files.
With 15.000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been made.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as spending or as payment means.
After the Bitcoin currency in June 2011 reached a maximum level of 30° (23 euro), he fell five months later to 2° before he has recovered to this day on around 日 (the curses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing especially impressive in comparison to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this report published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as the "the rational wage" with the greatest success, "in competition with the Property or the Euro" and "as the original currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of customary currencies such as the "Credits" used to come in a video game that can win or buy (and sometimes turn back) by games.
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
However, trade will be controlled and controlled every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network notes are at the same time containers of the account book, checkers, money issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually found between two email addresses in the form of a mail location.
With the subsection that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the handled bitcoins are available in the accountbook of the public accounts broadcast on the whole network.
The decision-making step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is about a mathematical task starting on the computers, including the winner, which is a form of temporary central banks, to add this additional line.
It is a broadcast of the file, e.g. converting a large file into a shorter and plain electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add her a number before the whole is "shaped".
The goal is to find the number that produces a specific fingerprint (much zero at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can check if it is the right.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the cat of all other transactions, and any change would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay the same money two times very quickly (not less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions from the network would be validated and the other remains without link, because both different fingerprints are left.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent an inflation, this reward is regularly met, probably before the end of 2012.
Thus, the Bitcoins around are limited to 21 million, but even to a hundred million dollars, which allows a certain playspace...
Moreover, the difficulty of the task will be increased with any improvement of the accounting service.
The lives of the network have already gone heights and depths.
The websites that provide bitcoin services were attacked and stealed the bitcoin facilities.
"The useful weakness body doesn't refer to the ­e protocol," assured Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports the possibilities of the money box using this anonymous service.
However, Bargeld also shows this deficit.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse S日 of this kind.
Others such as the WordPress blog platform are accepted.
Recently, Adi Sha and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the account book and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in the area.
In November a "Mega-Sclose-Screen" was started.
"30,000 have been replaced," pleased Jon Holmquist, who converts the bitcoins into gold for the Coinabul company.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this wallet, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or an uncontakt payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are more valuable.
Moreover, the inhaber manages its integrity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the operators, and the last must not install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify one address that can be "fotographed and recognised by a phone" means Pierre Noizat, which assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to be translated in the hierarchic systems to stronger horizontally aligned systems.
"There will take some time until Bitcoin takes place, but 2013 may be a turnpoint," he prognozes.
The ECB, however, provides in its report to revalue the different risks considered today in the case of a success of this election.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It's time that the Afghanistan Army takes the possession of its territory again, and that the Afghanistan people decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghanistan builders by viewing them as terrorists.
And we're killed with our 88 soldiers, as well as the losers and the fornicators.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremistes, former leaders who are lying to Pakistan, but often also from builders who refuse a weaponsed foreign presence, as in the days of the Soviet.
They want to defend their hundreds of years of age and archaetic traditions, even though they have joined them in Dschihadists, Pakistan, Arabs, Uzbeki and Tadskins.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local residents, the last will not be there if the western countries become discrete.
The decline of the French troops from the support point in Nicarab, which I observed by a hill covered with mandel trees, which was financed by French credits, was appropriate.
The overflowed ship- and panzer-convois of Hub-shooters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no more streams of the Taliban in Kabul.
From 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was on the basis of the fights of the various rebellious groups from the war over.
Their power was then considered as a kind of freedom and back to security.
The Afghanistan women have paid the price for the obscurance of builders overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved until today.
Early Mudshaheddin, Afghanistan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinated position.
The main personalities of the antisoviet war have come back to the power 2001.
They have transformed themselves into business operators by taking the government's basic elements to build them as refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive trade of submissions.
They've been forbidden, and most of them were not shared in fighting themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not combined from debt.
Young people want to leave the country as those who could use the Ananian applications: the capital flight is significant.
Young people have set the war and his ideas.
With their exhibition in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed their benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifteenth of the total population.
In the towns, the state schools are filled with girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurance of the single parties or to corrupt certain lead forces will be required to provide jobs.
All, including armed parties, are occupied by mobile phones; the television with its Turkish series, representing a modern world, will be viewed everywhere.
A army is now available.
Are the authorities under which the command manager will be considered legally?
Earlier committees of the antisoviet battle are already trying to restore the milisions in the province, which will be removed from the power of the Central Government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local activity would have benefited from a certain decentralisation in the western N°, but by dismissing the Office of the Minister, which was since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized state with a strong presidency.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the case of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 50s and already long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional steel works are not available, and important evaluation systems have not been repared.
Everything is imported; unless fruit and vegetables are produced nothing.
The private initiative is given the priority.
In a country based on war for 30 years, it would be necessary to control the infrastructure.
The ratio was extended to the Afghanistan's large land assessments.
This is still strengthening the impression that the Western countries were only in place to strengthen them.
Without energy to process the iron or buffer for place, or without transportation for export over the mountains, it is not possible to build mountains.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak's coppers, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) have made their excavations on the large buddhist stations and remain the main workers of the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan will also be necessary to restore normal relations from which the imports and exports are long-termly dependent.
The delay of the French fighting groups was completed on 20 November.
The new Co-operation Treaty provides the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and youthgymnasia, French universities Institute, French institution, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Defence Minister (Cimic), which has been established in 2012, has made many useful works and measures for the sanction of agricultural sanction and allowed a small French non-governmental organization to try to win the "herds and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of aid and open action.
These works that were necessary for many local workers have been able to undermine the resistance: the weakness, the sources, the drinking water, the reforestation, the fruit trees, the land protection and the increase of agricultural use areas.
What souvenir do we return to military expenditure of two billion euros?
A much more discreet budget will be to improve the local life conditions, which often are higher than 2000 meters in these areas.
In the message there are thousands of Scriptural requests of small agricultural properties of the province of Capisa.
In order to deliver the agricultors from the rebellion held by foreign groups, which is their own wishes, the continuation would require less, well-controlled and directly related civil aid to their benefits.
A Constitution with the breakfast in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
As regards the constitutional clay, which temporarily granted him the unlimited full power, more than ever, he decided to put everything on a card.
To surprise all of them, he announced at the middle Week that the Constitutional congregation will be adopted on the next day.
Just one week ago, the overseer of this plenary had granted two second months for the end of his work.
Egypt has now seen almost two years on a temporary, multi-modified text, which leads to the institutional stability and leads to a legal transaction.
This new initiative has only provided a stronger splitting of the country.
For his enemies, the President endures "autocratic delirium" by "continuing breathing his word" and "the right to the feet".
On its sides, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to clear the transition process.
In the midst of 14 days, a referencendum should be kept.
A very short period that forces the brothers to disturb their precept to declare the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the President, it is also a way to restore its public and democratic legitimacy while the Protest is in the whole country.
After confirmations in an interview with the Week view Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will be able to vote.
At the same time, the Egyptian people with this return to an overall vote will be made a Ultimate: "or you agree for my draft, or I keep the unlimited full power," the last should finally end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 most of the islamic members of this Constitutional congregation have introduced the text last night in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals did not follow the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional claim in the middle of November, they have dismissed themselves, because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views to destruction.
The representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve decisionability last morning, in all 11 persons, representatives, were assigned.
Some are very close to the Moslem brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles have been unanimously dismissed.
The commentators, however, felt amazing that the only difference in opinion of the day... in the time for prayer has been expressed, because some members of the Gremies were thinking that the pending of the constitutional congregation was not exactly.
The text that has been forwarded last night is consistent of 234 articles.
Article 2 that all attention took place remains the same with the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the principles of Scharia are the main source of the law".
The salafist parties for which the creation of the Islamic law is a major requirement had hoped to replace "the basic rules" by "the rules", which would have made a striker application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a evidence of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Scain ability" means the Liberals, which view this as a propaganda depression.
Because they follow the islamization of the Constitution on other articles.
This is particularly Article 220 in the eyes of the University of Al-Azhar, which recognises a advising function, especially regarding the verification of conformity with the laws of Scharia.
According to the Egyptian Specialist So ́e Pommier, this is insufficient because "the persons who are invited to a opinion have not been chosen and no democratic legitimateness.
You can see the first signs of the theocraty."
The protection of the Liberals is also due to the fact that the next director of this university is less likely than the current.
"There is now not to recognize a specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the citizen State.
The majority of the jurists who have held this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian Constitutional Transition.
He, however, makes it clear that, in relation to article 220, it can provide a majority, since the terms used are rejected to the religious chain.
This is particularly regarding the "Fiqh" [islamic legal proclaimment, Anm. d. Red].
And in the future the question could be opened where civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to religious aspects, the text that has been spent last night is criticized strongly due to the largest powers he granted to the President of the Republic.
The Moslem brothers suggest that these comparisons with the former regime are clearly reduced.
Another conflict: the powers of the military.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a national defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil procedures in military courts, as the units have requested to defend human rights.
The last members also share their cares regarding the text they view as a threat of freedom.
The reality of the blasphemy will be maintained, and weights are now prohibited, which might have serious effects on the right to free opinion, especially for the press.
Moreover, there is no article on the protection of women, stressing Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
Your opinion is the only positive point the prohibition of the folters under Article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
As the Egyptian President had to be expressed in television last night, the Demonstr was planned for this afternoon.
The officers of the State head will be marched on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the world's Nabel and a sea from the sun
The Promised Land units the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an inappropriate nature.
AIF calls you the five main reasons for a clue in Israel.
Return to the Holy Place
Visit the Fluss Jordan where Jesus was baptized.
It means that everyone who prayed in this flood receives God's blessing.
Galilea is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the change of water in wine on a holiday feast, which goes on the water, the silence of the seatorm and the fish.
On the other hand, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most sanctuary are located in Jerusalem.
Faithful follow here the path of suffering or crossway of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman Festival Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the graves on the mountain of Golgotha, where the crossing place, the salted stone and the grave of Jesus is.
Here is a Christian view of the Nabel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Closter of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is at the place where a Christian legend grew up according to the tree from which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most important place of the Jews, the claimers, the rest of a temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people leave there in various religions a sign with desires that then go into heritage.
Take a travel to the height
The ruins of the Massada Festival constitute the rest of the secret hidden before enemies, who built the Great Herod in 25 C.E. for his family.
They lie at a rock wall in the mountains in 450 meters high above the sea level.
Only mountain streams can get the ruins from their own power.
Everyone else brings a aircraft to this historical gipfel.
In the north of the country, in 1600 to 2040 meters height is the famous ski area Hermon, where it goes into the winter months, unnumberable tourists.
From the foot of the mountain, you get to Dorthin with a shuttlebus.
The skips have a total length of 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, gentical gods lived at the mountains.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Only one journey can not be viewed by all of them.
However, at least the five most interested of them should be paid.
Below it is the Israelian Museum near the Knesset (Parlament).
There old Qumran manuscripts or text roles are stored by the Dead Sea, found in Felshole in the Jewish wilderness, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exposures.
The Museum of Art in Tel A ́ is also valuable.
There is the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Museum in Bad Al Basha, which has a number of sales of old Turkish bathrooms with sculptures of the daily sugars and bathrooms.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique privacy Ra museum where you can be wondered by Dali and Rodin.
There are no Museum leaders or souvenirs there.
The entry is free, and S ́ is fundamentally rejected.
The fifth Museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel A¤, reported by one of the most vulnerable chapters of the story.
The most attractive department is the memory for children that was built to remember the 1,5 million children destroyed in the conquests and gas chambers.
At the end of the room there is full darkness.
The stars.
And the names of the Jewish children and the lands where they died.
In addition, Ukraine is inherited there.
Do something for health
The three main areas of the restoration of Israel are located on the surfaces of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places, there are weapons, water parks, delfinary and oceanaries.
It is surprised that in the Red Sea also is built in the winter months because the water temperature falls not under 21 °C and the air is heated up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is built over the whole year.
Above all, this unusual sea with a position of 417 metres under the sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
His turkis blue water has a high salt content and thus brings it even unfortunately unproblematic on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is undescribedly beautiful.
Here are treatments under the use of salt water (natural salt salt salt) and heal lamps, as well as the treatment of skin infections, allergies, asthma, exhibitions, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and the treatment of strapazier nerves.
To touch the secrets of the age
These secrets offer the old city of Tel A¤, namely the city of Jaffa at the Mediterranean.
Through this city, the famous seaway, the Egyptian, 日s, anatolia and Mesopotamies were connected together.
The city is inherited in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian liabilities.
According to deliveries, Noah built his architect right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists are pleased to crash through the heavy gates named by star characters.
Fortuna must be the legend according to all holds that touch the walls in the gate with its star character.
In Jaffa, you can contact newly collected couples from all Israel and even other countries at phototermines.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strike through the Roman theater and obtain the establishment of the cross ritters.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman citizens, including Pontius Pilatus.
In carefully restored theaters are recorded evening concerts and operas today.

The money in the travel will be taken into no euros, but in ́s that can simply be changed into shicks (current exchange rate: 1⁄3 to 3.8 cycles).
In the town you come forward to the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a street roadway and in Haifa the only U-Bahn line of the country with six St., which connects the subtown to the top city.

"The big and strong" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
Financial lawyers and citizen judges discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals have already acted with older certificates.
Annually, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Sankt Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tadschikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to deserve money for the entertainment of the families residing in the house.
On 1 December, a law entered into force, according to which each employee is required to test the knowledge of the Russian language.
This scheme is applicable only for migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the communal housing economy and in the single trade.
However, the tests with time must be binding for all guest workers.
This is not only the language tests, but also the Russian history tests and the bases of the law.
Language knowledge must be demonstrated both for the maintenance and prolongation of the employment authorisation.
Exceptions are only applicable to citizens of countries in which Russia is official.
On the other hand, those who have received their educational products and diplomas before the exit of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the test institutions will be under the egyde of the Puschkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of the People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburger State University and other Russian High Schools.
The migrants can release the tests in all cities; now more than 160 corresponding centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative for the implementation of tests was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Participants.
In the past, citizens' rights, before the entry into force of the Law, questioned several times the following question: What does the whole thing bring?
What changes brings the rule to show language knowledge, both for Russia and for guest workers?
In particular, it is to decrease the number of employees in the case of migration speakers.
"Many people now speak about the protection of the rights of work migrators," says the leader of the representation of the Federal Migrations Parties in Tadschikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must already be subjected before they are deprived.
Only a organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Problems have been affected by migrants without profession, education, language knowledge and their useful use.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will be met forbidden people with bad purposes that put him in a dark, strong baracke, where he will endure with thousands of his similar months without food and documents and will be created 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many challenges from our migrants.
"In the house you will speak, and at the arrival you will be attracted, get their feet and don't receive the pleasant loan," the leader of the work migration manager of the Tadish migration members, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't shoot, boss!
However, many citizens of Central Asian Republics who want to deserve their money in Russia are not only able to control the language of the target country but also to express themselves in their own language.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as the evil: only few Turkmen, usbekens and tads can also lead to a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is no money yet to eat the children, but to buy them responsibility clothes, shoes and schools.
As teenager, these children take the first opportunity for money.
"It's hard without language knowledge," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and minor."
Civil rights show the following important aspect of the Law.
The test must only be missed by migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no of employment.
The majority of guest workers remains illegal in Russia.
"Welcome welcome" or "Disbound access to unleavened"
Some migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is official forces and, of course, the language difficulties.
◆ Legalisation is costed: 12 to 16 thousand Rubel.
An older registration can be made quickly and only for a half thousand.
The Russian police employees know that our documents are most old and we are not registered, and then there are cases of pressure.
"You want one or two hundred Rubels for cigarettes and tee," says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"No costs for wrong papers only"
Just on the day that the law entered into force, it appeared that not only the registering documents of the migrants could be age.
Some of the elderly certificates confirming the validation of the language test have already been subjected by the employees of the Feather Migration Participants.
The printed papers were printed with a usual color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these otherwise: each migrant who hoped that the tests could be saved so paid for the document seven thousand Rubels.
This is more than double as the costs for the official test: this costs a work migrator three thousand Rubels.
In order to not simply cover the certificates, both officials and citizens are agreed with the main immediate task of switching the system before corruption.
For the moment, the authorities may solely promise guest workers who fall through the test on the first time, that they will receive time for a language basis course.
Furthermore, newcommunications, without language knowledge, will be offered institutions in areas where no active comprehension with people is necessary.
Internal Ministry ignores illegal weapons
A number of legal weapons in criminal crimes very small
The Russian Internal Ministry creates a disarmament of the weapons law for private weapons owners.
This is how the authorities respond to the youngest events: damage in shoots at holidays and seven deaths during the Moscow Jurist Dmitri Winogradow.
The police wants to prohibit the weapons of non-mortal weapons in the public and to restore the age of 18 to 21 years for the possession of shots of weapons.
The proposal has supported the President of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and claimed that the amendments to the Legal of Army are submitted in Duma.
Not all are satisfied with that the Russian authorities want to cope with the problems by "training the rocks".
In the Internet, a open letter was published, whereby the manufacturer - representatives of various weapon connections - requested by the authorities to take away from "insensitive disturbations".
The proof of crime with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal judge, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian BBC service.
According to the Statistics of the Internal Ministry, 142 crimes under the application of the registered weapons were executed during six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand delicts were completed for the same period.
The operators of the open letter are convinced that a derogation of the law for the private weapons owner of crime will not be stopped from serving on the black.
Today, you can find any possible weapons for little money, according to Moscow.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs shows that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from manufactures to officers
The weapons passed over several channels on the black.
There are five such main channels, told a former prince Viktor Baranez, who was employed in the Ministry of Education and in the General Stab.
Screenshot of a web page that accepts the weapon orders
The first channel is the army or military, which is the weapons that were shot during the battle in Kaukasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Kaukassians themselves," says Baranez.
The second channel comes to illegal weapons, the orders of criminals are stolen.
Baranez states that there are weapons that have been killed both from the police and directly by the criminal persecutors.
Other illegal weapons are thrown from military arms.
Many military layers often came to explosions.
"There are evidence that in some cases, it was a fuel in order to interfere with the failure of weapons," says the former military citizen.
According to Baranez, the weapons manufacturers also contributed to the black.
"Today there are a number of privacy waste factors that do not hold the international competition and therefore determine the weapons under hand on the black, including in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of black is the smuggle.
Many guns and weapons come from poor countries like Kirgizian.
"There is a own, sometimes handful production and a mafia that organizes the smuggle," states the former military citizen.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated the part of each of the five channels in the delivery of black ́s with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report from the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration was reported.
The experts analysed reports of the Internal Ministry and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Crimeological Literatures and public accessible data on portals on the issue of weapons.
The major part of the illegal weapons is, according to the military and legal protection members.
The help of all weapons on the black shall be there through the "shopping of responsibles who have reached their work with weapons", says the report.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons from conflict areas, 14% are returned to the depth of the weapons production, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A soldier of a weapons, which doesn't mean to be called, assures that weapons that are found in illegal excavations are already buying no more, since they are old.
According to him, it is more often that the handlers take care of the trail in a weapons store.
A weapon, for example a gun of type TT, is covered over a feed.
The weapon is issued and delivered by the tissue.
"The vendor brings the weapons into the city and puts it in there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he said
"The police, of course, knows everything and leads, therefore, if it doesn't comply with the plan to detect crimes, periodically control buying for the operators, offering illegal weapons," is added by the seller's adviser.
"How to Load the Lux"
Buyers and sellers most often find aware of each other.
I had looked at web pages and blogs when someone was looking at me and suggested to come to the Bagowaja station where a person would wait for me, which brought me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapons I first experienced there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To take care of a weapon, I need a known person who has contacts," said the adviser. "I have such a known person, but I don't trust him."
There are vendors on the markets, but there you need to go and use a code as "of Iwan Iwan Iwanovitsch, which allows the daughter to lose a teeth".
I'm even coming to some storms on a recognition I trust.
He also gives me the sticks only because he knows that I don't get him.
Newlingers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military citizen Viktor Baranez tried in the middle of the 1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schemes have not changed him accordingly.
He got a photo album in which "all possibles" were designed.
"I felt like in the luxe load," reminds the military citizen.
The buyer does not say Baranez gets the cat in the sack, but can test everything.
I, as a potential customer, buy not just, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we set up a goal.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the weapons have a good shot, we'll negotiate together," the expert describes the procedure.
Buy out of the sofa
Internet search machines show search results to web pages and groups in "contakts", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
There are no papers needed or personal meetings.
"They only need the amount of money," it says in the advertising page "Buy campaigns or feeds".
There users open your orders and ask questions.
Does the minority also be baptized?
"Of course without licence," users ask "Iwan" (normal quota).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the Laconic Question of "Fedorenkow".
The Food Safety Service has recently activated a number of web pages, and the purchasers who wanted to purchase the weapons are going to the network.
People come like hungry fish in food and lands in Siberia and can screw cold
Military commentator and former military citizen Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered in the foreign, and the Russian laws are not applied.
The responsibles accept the orders.
The purchaser shall consider the money on a bank car.
"In response he receives a photo and description of the hidden of the weapons," reports the press speaker of the useful organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitri Kislow.
Viktor Baranez highlights that you can also go out to the closure and come behind the grids if you place a request on a website.
The Food Safety Service has recently activated a number of web pages, and the purchasers who wanted to purchase the weapons are going to the network.
"The people come like hungry fish in the feeding and countries in the Syrian workshop and can shoot cold," he says.
A Makarow for $100
In purchasing illegal shooting weapons, experts should be calculated with prices of 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislow by the "Prevo to Oryzhie" organization, you can buy a gun from the type Makarow for 100 to 300.
You have to wait until a half month.
The weapons are issued in military arms stores by overseers of the middle borders.
According to the official statistics of the Internal Ministry, the number of delicts with illegal weapons in all Russia in January to October 2011 returned to 7% to 22,9 thousand, while the number of discovered cases of steel and pressure related to weapons, munition, splitting materials and spending equipment was decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fixed feed and super-building employees
Each fourth American youth is sitting behind McDonald's box
In the past days, there were massive protests in the United States against low sales in the Walmart and Restorants people of fixed food cats such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kendy's Fried Chickens.
Nobody can predict whether the protests will be still thrown or whether they will go back to the air soon.
Protests are supported by workshops and several links-oriented user organisations.
Besides the increase of the famous sales of simple Walmart and fixed feed employees, the protest organisations follow the objective of establishing workshops.
This brochure of the economy has not been actually organized.
46 cents per year?
The Protests started last week after thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where they found sales in the United States, millions of customers claimed, which resulted in the case of hands.
On this day, some Walmart partners, of whom there is 2,2 million worldwide, put their work low and deployed together with workshops and left activists, and their target groups are low and average income.
Walmart produces all products, from Windels over yoggewehre and car batteries to pulmonary, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is between 8 and 27% more favorable than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the lowerly paid Walmart employees have only been purchased in their own workplace.
The prices and the product classification made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart is often able to exhaust the product only so favorably because the employees are badly paid.
Latests also complain about hard work conditions, such as lacking staplers or handscanners.
The participants of the Protest requested loan increases at the "Black Friday" and expressed their harm that the contribution to the operating hospital insurance was made from 30 to 100 ° per month.
A typical Walmart worker, who deserves $9.5 for the hour, couldn't give up this increase, they said.
Scientists from the Californian University in Berkeley show that if the company increases the average wage to 12 °, it would cost 3,2 billion.
That's about 1,1% more than they are now for payment.
If Walmart had completely killed the payments to the customers, each purchasing costed it only 46 cents more.
This would be for them every year in comparison with today's more expenditure of only 12.39.
For Walmart's employees, it is satisfied that only in nine federal states have come to Protests and they have not protected any loss to the company.
The Black Friday lasts 8 hours night on Thursday to midnight the next day, and in this period, Walmart surprised about 5000 articles per seconds.
In total, the Walmart casses carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The speaker of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-oriented Huffington Post site that all "lower than five" Walmart employees were working and the protest was only "a PR-Trick" of the work that was organized by the Protest.
"Free Kasse!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart branches (they are not wished in this progressive town and are therefore inexistent) but McDonald's and other precious restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company has a billion portions, and yet you don't have any hospital days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New Yorker Cityrats
Currently, the minimum loan, according to the patriarch and the New Yorker law, is 7.25日 the hour.
In fixed feed restaurants, the minimum loan is too strong, however, and in the average their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars will receive the hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this dark city.
As it is possible to get out with so little money in New York, I'm unemployed.
There was one time when almost a quarter of all American youths after school at McDonald's behind the teacher, however, the young people lived with their parents.
Someone saw the main income source or plant in there to stay longer there.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's workers, I have to meet people who are constantly regreting that they come out with this wage and sometimes even have to eat their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum that the manufacturer notes that it is unresponsible to get children if you don't know how to eat it.
The participants of the protests who started at Thursday at 6.30 tomorrow before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue requested that the casiers and kitchen of fixed food restaurants receive a minimum loan of 15 US dollars, which corresponds to more than a duplication of the current minimum loan.
They continued to request the training of works in the fixed feed breast.
The US law prohibits the management of the business to stand in the way of this goal and to dismantle or delay the members of the business.
On the other hand, business management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of businesses in the fixed feed breast is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high personal fluctuation.
Uncomfortable
There were also many other fixed food restaurants in Manhattan on this day.
The height point of the protest was a congregation in the middle before McDonald's at Times Square, in which some local democrates spoke, including Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says that there is a billion portions, and yet you will not be given a hospital day, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New Yorker democrats, for example, the citizen-master candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "We should share the fast-food partners together so that they can receive a righteous loan and achieve the economic welfare that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to New York Times, this was the greatest action of their species in the history of the American Fast Food Industrie.
However, just a few hundred people were in front of the place, from which not all were employed in the fixed feed bread, in which ten thousand worked in New York.
It is still not to disclose whether the function of this protest will mobilise all mass.
"The brain can only overlist moderately"
The theme of the enlarged reality in modern technology approaches is recently observed by the lines of a special brilliant.
First, Google presented a functioning model at his annual conference in the summer, then in November, that Microsoft had also reported a corresponding patent.
However, in conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D technologies in Microsoft Labor in Cambri日 Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the brilliant for the company's creators was only a station.
It enhances the possibility of manipulating sole objects in the air with only hands and creating free spaces.
- Please describe quickly what research your group has done.
- We are working with the interaction of humans and machines, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
To this end, mankind is mostly staying in the stage, in which pixels on flat screens are being touched, sometimes.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and to predict the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the kinect sensors are a progress, and today no Xbox will be overwhelmed without kinect, since everyone is interested in moving control.
- What's going on in the future?
- Since Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, not decided by the issue until now.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional presentation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We have to leave the computer world in our physical world and make them more fascinable.
However, it is necessary not only to the user but also to recognize its environment.
Then we could add the real world much easier through ambitional objects.
And first of all, we should be released from these protected Virtual Reality Healms!
- What do you think of language control?
She's nice, but will she not be overvalued?
- It is certainly not the solution to the question of the matter, because you do not always want to inform all those who are involved in its actions and intentions.
Actually, every kind of interaction with computers is good, but everyone in their specific neck.
For example, in the field of control of objects on public places, we experienced a project with shorts and buttons, instead of outloading gestures.
The guests were not opened by the object camera, but by a armband that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically can be reduced to the size of a armband.
However, in general, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as ethnic and language.
- How is that?
- Would you like to ask me, for example, to give you this pre-dose?
They're saying it, and they're talking about it at the same time.
- Normally, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, it would be very hard to recognize.
- Is that what you want the user to adapt to what a machine can offer to the time and what doesn't?
- Not in terms, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we must work in particular on the development of new sensor types that can make people's reactions more accurate.
For example, this can be Laser sensors, because they offer a solution in the depth, which is very important.
- What advice do you provide from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is it missing solution, deepness, or something else?
- The current generation is, in fact, a good startpoint for our work in the field of three dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels would not be bad with a speed of 1000 fps.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
This is how all the current technologies are not good enough for us, since the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the solution within the X and Y, but also at the Z axis.
Also the speed and number of images per seconds are important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps are too few for guests.
Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a meeting sensor with a regular delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, whereas today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much that affects the interaction of humans and machines.
For my work, I needed exactly a preparation, only without the control and with more images per second.
- Doesn't the number of cameras be locked?
- Kinect → Currently with three "cameras", one of which is a infrarooter and the second is a recipient for the reflected signal.
And the camera is actually a normal RGB camera.
It does not serve for the depth of the object.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or enhance the problem, because there would be more needed arrangements.
It would be a flexible, kinect-like system where we could play with different camera facilities to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional investigation of a position.
- If I remember right, Microsoft presented not his brilliant public.
Do you not think that, as regards the application of the technologies of the extensive reality, the brilliant has the best views?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to keep in the road an archphone in the hand raised, but I think that the greatest variant would be a "modified" reality where we could switch over a cloud from the brilliant to the artphone,
The brilliant is a personal Gadget and there is its strength (privates can only see), but at the same time also their weakness, because an extensive reality by brilliant prevents you to work together with others on adequate objects.
- Imagine a moment that the manipulation of hologrammes in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man but also available to normal deaths.
There is a problem that often indicates the criticism of this idea: There is no sensitive reaction!
The hands do not look at anything!
What answers do your group want to give to this entry?
- In my readings, I often say that the increased reality represents the seventh interruption in interaction between humans and machines.
I think the eighth interruption could be through the integration of the taktil care.
A interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as something unusual projection.
She takes the pressure greatly true!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to provide "images in the air" some hands, for example, the interference of some guided Ultrashall radials in a certain point where the finger is, a feeling that is still so weak than someone was pulling over the handballs.
There are also bands for the handheld that affect the nervening in the figs, and this is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to list the brain?
Does it think that it's what it's supposed to look if it's just seen something?
- That's a idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will still have to fight, namely, to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is located in a open, practically unfinished room; here we work on concepts with driving bags (other than in fitness studies), moved platforms and big bottles.
Even so, the brain can only be measured, and there are many working years before us.
This makes the work in the area of the reality of a researcher so attractive: in many subjects, we are only at the beginning.
Private shackmack place Culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburger Avantgarde" project, which is designed by the people of the city, which forms the avantguard of art and culture.
On the reading list, high-range representatives of the Petersburger artists have already landed, whose success passed out over the borders of the city and often found recognition in Europe without being in Russia.
The new herd of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the ships clothed in red, which you're faced by the Russian Museum, once at the Sommer Garden, once at scene-traffs or on the disgusting cases.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are also published, they have great human masses.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburger-social-losophic artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a lighting personality of the Petersburger Avantgarde end of the 80s or beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and is insulted by his presence on the street to his citizens a lake in his face and cares for them for the Laune.
Nevertheless, he snippet a triangle and became Petersburger triangle player, since he finally felt ready for this difficult role in his artist, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red, not for example in yellow or Turkish in the city?
I chose the red color as a designer, which seems different to the optical and image.
In this world, the root of the compromise is between artists, image advisers and society.
In the society, everything that depends on the grid standard, aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provokation.
Each of my past procurement was a invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a maler?
- In a newspaper in the Newski Cultural Palace, where my work was issued.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized times at that time, and new and free times as I was unconscious.
I friended me with the designs of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", that was "Puschkinskaja 10", and then it was only a closs.
I'm going to the theater, to ́, to music, to everything, outside the literature.
And all this is united in the Art-Clinic... - I was important to stand in the middle of the Petersburger culture where the best creating artists should be gathered together.
In 1995, I posted a room in Puschkinskaja 10, where there was a musical artistic club for the Boheme, the house of Petersburger Boheme.
They were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I also remember how Snur with the project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Snur and his friends sing simple Li® to playback, carrying hard tricotes and belonging to them also the Igor Wdowin composite today.
When the group began playing alive, it was from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg modernized many programs before "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great car, but he learned the foundations with us.
Also the "D 137" gallery or the Griboedov club have its ursp in the art clinic.
Our workers and staff guests went there.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture still meaning something.
In 2000, there was an exam in the press in which the expression "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "artists of the year" and so I was reached at the high point.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without providing a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an incomplete style.
-My pictures are real perles and clearly bring up the update and harm of the thoughts.
I'll have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are untimely.
Before I was social, but now it is worse and ready to be so.
In a Clown, it's all cleared and lost his tragic.
I love the Great, and I have great ideas.
For example, let us rescue the world by predicting that everyone has completely dressed himself.
Now everyone looks at the clothing and orients himself to the outside and not to the inside of the human.
But you may not be able to give a man the hand, but it should be stuck in his face.
The swimming disappears by clothing.
We've seen you in the role of the townic triangle player.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art be nice too?
- Today, commercial art must be cautious, careful and funny.
We'll see the disappearance of cultures.
Earlier, people formed great groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to enjoy all.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that likes everyone.
Now you have to think who you'll like.
Now every cool star has about 100 attachments.
- To the occurrences of Stas Michailow, but there are thousands!
- Women left to him, where the sex-social speech plays a role.
Cultural reasons are 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there are less management, money, and everything is based on.
I have attachments, and the most important is not to hurt them and not to disturb the achievement.
In my youth, I have drawn such images that even walked in a collector with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come at the end of the Karèe.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumption.
The consumption has no culture, that's something else.
I am a man of the past culture and growing up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to draw.
That's the culture I used.
- Kirill, what does Petersburg miss?
- Good cultural expert.
They say, "Cultural servants."
However, not everyone of them can consider culture.
It was different in the real villages, because the stars may not understand much of culture, but they realized that the right experts needed.
In Moscow, there are currently advisers.
In Petersburg, we have some experts, but they are locked the way, because there is a need for higher experts who evaluate the first and make them free.
Now it's just the same thing.
The same applies to Erarta, however, with the subsequence that they honestly say that they are not all accepting modern art and that they have to look for some times for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the city of culture; there is much more culture and a corresponding neighbourhood in Moscow.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural neighborhood, for for example, we have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many new people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Art must be again modern, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed from the city of Sankt Petersburg
Birthday in the world
Earth inside.
Hardness or concomitance with Cilerasteroid.
Karawans of Ra's chiefs with earthly residents on board are searching for a substitute planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can continue in the insufficiency or on the substitute plane?
I don't think there are options of choice.
The fact is that there are only two real planets that we could at least be hypothetic.
"Thus Mars and Venus," says the scientific collaborator of the Astronomical Starberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, as the conditions on Mars are likely living friends, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of the Venus.
Life would only be possible in a large height or in the cycle of Venus, so in all,
The question of continuation in all the researchers treated in relation to Flora.
Only a half centuries ago, experiments were conducted with Pf·en.
The fourth generation of the inherited in orbits did not distinguish in the least of the earthly species.
It followed the movement of insects, more precisely from winning flights (Droso öbla), in the orbit.
In 1979, Watchtowers were sent to worldwide to investigate how the insufficiency affects the development of Emevery.
It's a very normal kitchen.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the kitchen has to find hold; it must be able to stand on his feet and start moving," states the lab of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without a fixed background, the kitchens were wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn were completely disturbed.
The kitchen did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they just died.
"Double times we left kitchens and put the whole back, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Wladimir Sychew holds on a disappeared experiment with the kitchens in all.
The last brush with animals fell in the orbit 16 years ago.
In early 2013, the experiments were continued.
However, on the Biosatellite "Bion" only will be similar species.
There was a experiment with rats that have already been sent into all.
The principle was not found in this regard.
"It was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," Wladimir Sychew noted.
After the landing, the world space rats were grown up.
The problem of continuing directly in the world was not able to solve until now.
The task is hard.
Animals who are scattered from their natural lifespace can simply not follow their continuation operation.
In contrast to animals, humans could be the principle.
The homogeneity is able to abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
These experiments are not conducted from ethical reviews.
But women have flyed to all since 50 years.
There was the most risk in Tereschkowa.
The most valuable that mankind is is the female organism.
Our movings fled from, and no one on earth could answer the following question: Is it overwhelmed by the world area flight?
Will they be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Nobody answered this question," says Watschnadse Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after its world space flight, the first female cosmon, Valentina Tereschkowa, was born a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman was born in All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was two times in the orbit and even worked outside the room vehicle, a son.
However, a risk remains.
We have only a few extremely little cosmonautes, where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy adults.
"More, more older itself is in flights in the orbit," concluded Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, the Held of the Soviet Union and the Held of the Russian Federation.
And however, humankind must seek new ways in the bio, the protection of the streams and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaborate in the preparation area of cosmonautes is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here, in a swimming state, the Cosmonaute Routine wined for the work in the open world.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if growing water is a pleasure, it is a strange environment; but youths receive water as a natural element.
It's like the small yotyanders would prove that life in the country has reached the Ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the bathroom of the mother in the wheat water, and that it can be easier to water.
In Prince it is logical, since from birth to first swimming just once 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says Babyschwimm's teacher Marina Aksenowa.
As a newborn child is, then, the weakness is a much more natural state, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of insufficiency, the bath and beach muscle is very quickly back and thus takes the ability to express the child.
All right, we're going to run this through a birth-in-lawing tool.
For example, the birth may also be located in a special room to press the child.
"But what does it then?", says the unimportant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also takes artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earthly relationship, the organism cannot educate the scale and muscles.
A newborn child can not be cut in the orbit as an adult for training in a charge.
He will simply fail what is more important for his life.
"This experiment that we face together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a preventive, perfectly unadaptated people into the world," says the leader of the Bioethic Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
To this end, the birth of children in the world is only the theory.
At times, however, it will be real if the earthquake in her ra's chiefs breaks up to a remote planet that will be the house for her in all the birth of their descendants.
Chief of NKU: Control of the black system rejected by debt of the
However, the Czech Republic is replaced in its application in relation to public mandates on control institutions and added laws.
In the case of currently.cz, this is the Vice-President of the Highest Control Amtes (Highest Control Authority, NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be properly applied - and this is not my opinion to us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result seems to be a common control by the Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he directs the position of Prime Minister Petr Netime to the "Chwarz System".
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not disturb the undertakers with controls - is the system now prohibited or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, then it is not simply possible to come to the Governing President, and the control office, whose obligation is now to control the compliance of the law, is to stop in its activities," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control of the Deputy Chamber, you talked about a common Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries relating to public tasks were compared.
What did it really happen?
It is a parallel examination with which we have started about two years ago.
It is simply simply that the legislation defines how public tasks are to be maintained, and then the national laws are developed, and there is still the practical application.
All of this we have compared together, and although the test has not yet been completed, we could find extremely interesting subsequences.
In order to ensure that it is not enough to set up new and precise rules again, it is also necessary to be discussed with the practical application of the law.
How can the project be a help for you? What happens to you from this project?
Soon a common control could help us to stop trying to perfectionate the laws and to decrease and extinction of weight values, if it appears not to be particularly positive.
Economy means to buy a thing to a reasonable price (what is not always the lowest price) and to exclude illegal area creation or criminal action.
But the decreasing of sugar values for jobs does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Maybe it's even that we're loading the system in this way only with a excessive "paper frame" and those who are looking for flashes in the system are essentially easier to use the system than if the weight values remain.
They are talking about the problems in practical implementation of the Czech Republic Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority like our NGOs here, or does the system work differently?
As regards the authorities, the German Pen­vern is the NKU of the Bundeshof, which is similarly built in us and also on a college, which is just a different form, but the same work is based on both authorities.
In addition, the competences are comparable to a certain measure, but Germany is a Federal State, such as the fact that these accountants are also in the individual federal countries - which the German system is different from ours.
The BRH is only able to control the bonds that correspond to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the areas and communities are subject to the control of the Court of Justice.
What about the German legislation is it easier than ours?
I would generally simply compare this without concrete information, and I would like to say that Germany is in particular better.
Is that like that the tests are better in there?
This is certainly not, but as said, I don't like such comparisons.
It is still noted that those countries who are an example for us also have to cope with problems.
Otherwise, they would not have anything from a cooperation with our authority, right?
What about the Czech legislation, what was the importance for your authority to renew the provisional law, do you have any effect?
In view of the fact that this Novelle is first a short time in force, it does not affect our tests until now.
Since our controls are located soon, you have to calculate here with a certain delay.
The effects of the future controls in the preparation phase - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Acknowledgement of the risks of the uneconomicity" and with this approximately 14,000 public tasks - here the changes will certainly be affected because the changes of the weight values have been modified by the conditions for certain types of claims, etc.
Do you see the derogation of this law more positive, or is the system charged with other bureaucracy?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and hopes that this adoption is to be taken.
However, the problem may occur that the rules will be "strender" and cannot be kept anymore.
Previously under the previous rules, the examination of persons undertaken to the contractor (e.g., in the case of a operational programme of the Regional Policy, the Regional Council) is competenced that any non-compliance with the provisional law is equal to a damage of the budgetary division.
Does it then mean to make the law still stronger?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and misuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form of error that does not affect the decision-making.
Such a system only presses the Office under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
Let us say one time which way is not targeting.
The Prime Minister said soon that the ODS would not deal with the controls of the "swarm system" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, it is not simply possible to come by the President of the Government, and the control office, whose obligation is now to control the compliance of the law, is to prevent its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do so as if nothing would be.
The law contains relatively strong rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the offerer is excluded with the best boat only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is what I think we miss.
On the streets, iron is simplified, but mostly they are thirsty.
On the streets of Czechland, there are partly snow and iron.
Increasingly, the roads are well guided, and there is a high prospect offered.
Karlsbad
In the area of Karlsbad, the streets were well guided today tomorrow, simplified snow and iron.
The temperatures reflect at -5 to -10 °C, it will be a bit warmer over the day.
In the region it is no longer snippet, and in the deepest height sets it remains only a dark snow.
However, on the villages of the jargeberg are about 30 cm snow.
According to the surroundings of the Road Way, the Nebels had limited view.
The roads of R6 and the routes of the first road class in the region are currently unlimitable.
However, notice is offered for example on bridges on which the trains are below and clear.
Similarly, all the road routes of the second and holding road class, are guided by the mountain roads.
However, on these streets, the snowest remains strictly white or outside.
In addition to the positions, there is therefore a higher attention offered.
Country of Pardubice and Royal Royal
On some roads East Böhmen, there is an outdoor snow in the streets because of iron, inside the mountains and in the mountains, the road and carrying direction are shared on their websites.
The road masters warn drivers of iron, which may occur in particular in positions in Pardubice area.
In particular, it can come on the basis of the second and strict road class in the circles Lanškroun, Usti over Orlicí, Politica, Svitavy and Vysoké Myto.
The streets I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are treated chemically.
Snow is especially located on the streets in the riesenberg and in the mountain Orlical Hory.
A outdoor snow wheel is located in high places on the roads of the Rychnov Circle over Kněeu and Trutnov.
In the East River, it is most solarly or hot today, and it remains long-termly free.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, weighting a weak wind.
Beark pills
The streets in the area of pilses are well guided today, but locally it is offered high attention, and the way is to adapt the time.
This is fresh tomorrow, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees under the fridge point.
Since it has snippet before and the temperatures later fell, it can come to iron on the streets.
In fact, it is also to be calculated with the cloud, but the view will be improved in the daily past.
This information consists of the circuit strategy.
The car car D5 is practically unlimitable, but increased attention was recommended by the streets between the 80th and the 13th kilometre.
The trains of the first road class are highly dropped, but they are frozen.
However, in the south of the circle pilses and Tachov, it can be broken to iron.
The roadways of the second and strict road class are covered, and therefore the reference is also applied to possible sections.
The drivers should, mainly, be especially careful on the less frequent roads in the area of Böhmerwald.
Bezirk Olomo
Today, with snowmatch, the drivers who are in the direction of the high positions in the Olomo area are on the road.
After the use of stream vehicles, sneematsky remains on the Pass Chervenohorské sedlo and on the street towards Videlský cross.
Nightly snow streets forced the streets to use, in the circle of Shumperk, the road manager was given about 3 cm newsnee.
In the remaining areas of the area, the trains are most unlimitable.
"In the circle of Shumperk remains in the higher positions yet snowest.
On the pass of Chervenohorské sedlo, the drivers must count Jesenik with snowmatsch," said a worker of the Road Management Schumperk today against the Agency CHTK.
Also their colleagues in the Jesenik Circle had to come out the night, as their information indicated, the roads are free and nass to the high places after chemical treatment.
In the Olomo circle, the streets are unlimitable, but in the circuit of Sternberk, the drivers have to be careful in Walda areas because the trains are still fucking here.
Beach of Life over Labem, Liberec
In northern bodies, the streets of the streets report a number of bad traveling streets.
Besides several places with snow or iron, the mountain street from Telnice to Knínice is locked in the circuit of Usti n.K. according to the Verties Police.
The temperatures also remain in deeper levels under zero, so snow and iron will be kept on the streets. From the deep levels, especially south of the Bohemic Mediterranean, there are no problems, and the streets are usually dropped.
There have not been reported any transactions.
Iron is reported in particular from the circuit of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this night - tonight over rain and snow, in the night of uncleless heaven and Frost.
From the main streets and from the street I/13 at the border of the street Usti n.L. and Liberec are reported bad conditions.
The street sphere between Telnice and Knínice was needed on the basis of aests that were made by the snow load to the train.
Simon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think of finding place in less than one month of the world's past?
This is one of those catastrophes to which people are so pleased to start.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make us rather fun and say that we are the only band of the world that can collect sufficient positive energy to stop or prevent the world's past.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world income.
Can you imagine our readers the project closer?
It's a countrywide profit event we've planned for two years.
For this purpose, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end has been prognosed for 21 December at 11:10 tomorrow.
On the day before, e.g. on 20 December, from 21:00 at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava are located.
The end of the concert must be at the time that the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a period of 12 hours before us.
Who's this idea?
In fact, I'm sure, then, we've made the idea together with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We want not only to collect enough energy to prevent the world's past but also to think about the situation in which we give this world once to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a single collection of shoes, T-shirts, sticks and key attachments against the world's outcome, with their purchases on www.e-tap.cz.
The Band The Tap Tap has also included the hymne against the world income with the title "Wollow falls out".
Today, the hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will it also be taken into the benefit concerts?
Of course, and even to the end, it's supposed that everything's broken and the world's past is not worth...
The hymne must be sing by all interpreters on all three concerts at the same time.
The hymnes will live together in a direct shift of the Czech TV.
The text of the hymne is from Thomas Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the videoclip, also Xindl X sing with...
How did you come to cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech Cultural Zen, which involves that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to intensify these people in our projects.
It has shown that most of us are interested in a cooperation with us and enjoy it.
What is the purpose of redemption of concerts against the world’s past?
For the establishment of the Barry Education Space Studeo, in which we have been working with the United Tap in the Jedlikka Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlikka Institute are regularly assessed by actors who help them in different freedoms.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the sectors, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlikka Institute, we will have a own building in which we will then include this project.
There are several groups and experts in each concert.
What criteria have you looked for this?
We wanted to set up a program that corresponds to all generations of children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Lesbiens Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jirí Searchy.
Anything else you can learn on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May, we come up first on Prager Frühling, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year, we would like to come in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, this would also like to connect to events in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small until you have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group of people who are combined with obstacles.
How do you control these travels logistic and organic?
It's not so bad as it appears on the first corner.
Five of our members are roll steel drivers, e.g. the rolls must be transported in the packaging room. Of course, we need to drag a lot of instruments and other packages...
Unfortunately, it has always gone out without problems, CHSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes been partially marvelled.
Even in Moscow, where we were lately, there were no problems.
Through your foreign journeys, you have a comparison, as it looks like in individual countries with freedom of bar, how to walk there with corrupt people, etc.
How did you get these things up to now?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than us, we were just witnesses in Russia that everything is still in the East.
In contrast to Prag, Moscow is absolutely not backending. It is still unusual when someone in the chair is alone in the city's room.
It is not even self-intelligent that, for example, a role carrier is going to take place.
Happy, there also comes along with those who are trying to refer to the problems of people with preventions.
And in what ways should we repeat towards the further developed countries?
There's a lot of things that we're dealing behind...
However, it is still noted that the improvement of the situation is still depending on the efforts of the employees.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely usually that people with serious obstacles can move themselves in the public room, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not just usually that there is a larger group of protected people actively shared in social events, in which we are a little before the Tap Tap band!
Respect in the public and freedom of bar is a thing, but only when the things come from our range of significant sporters, artists, players, chairers or advocates, the things will really begin to change.
This is only individual cases of particularly desired personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very tragic. But when we go back a few years: What has you motivated in 1998 to create a band?
At that time, I began to be manager in the Jedlikka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in working with something intense.
And when I'm a musician and I'm a saxophone player, I've created a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with the time, it is how our Moderator, Ladja Angelovič, is to say, something without control.
But the band was known only in the last years, or I'm wrong?
It is true that cooperation with singers has helped us, and we have also started to be active for us.
We have become conscious that if you leave something and not see this outside, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU's contributions, we can also provide actors, high-quality devices, etc.
Was it your goal to take it with the Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning I saw the potential that you could take the things differently.
The showbusiness often copys one of the other today.
This is logical in his way, since all news looks with precaution and is accepted only after longer time.
There's just a few really unique things, and I'm aware that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the overseer has mostly is, of course, compassion; that is just...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous because people with obstacles are not unique and lost ways that we should suffer.
There are people who can live a full life and develop themselves if they have the necessary means.
I'm always saying that if people face something with obstacles, this is not just a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strong boss, as you hear of many people?
If you want to do something good, you can not enter into many things any compromises and also need a certain disclosure.
This is my opinion, but it's totally normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they then find that they have the weekly trial two times, they have to solve preparation phases and take a lot of time on concert travels, then the disappointment will occur at many quickly.
But it works over all, in every band that wants to work seriously and get something.
Currently the Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of these have been taken from the beginning, e.g. since 1998?
Only one: Lady Angelovich.
We're a open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and does the pleasure to join is always welcome to us.
Finds place on the day before the prognosed world income, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynoim/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three event types are connected to the closs by life-scale, and it makes a common interpretation of the hymne "Wollow falls out" of the Band The Tap Tap.
The purpose of the concert is to set up the funds for the installation of a multifunctional infrastructure area that will be found under the name STUDEO in the Jedlikka Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The income costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available in the booking of Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the world.
Last week, Poland was included at a Ministerial meeting of the Member States of the European World Space Organization of ESA as the twenty-first member of this worldwide member, and the second Member State from the former East Block (after Czechland, which became ESA-Mitglied on 12 November 2008).
In 1994, Poland began a close cooperation with the ESA and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland to the world room was freely started much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Poland cosmosisters were busy with the room car, and they were not always understood.
For example, I note here the proposal of A. Sternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warschauer Observatorium, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Iningang to Kosovo".
The ideas of the young engineer, however, left the auditors cold, and after years, Sternfeld even reminded that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld wined the Price REP-Hirsch made by Robert Esnault and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major defensor of the astronomy and the space carrier.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disclosures.
Gadomski's worldwide recognised contribution to the development of the space travel was appreciated by the name of one of the craters on the acquired side of the month after him.
In 1925, there was a race-drasine built in Poland for which a raketen equipment was planned.
The author of the design and the details of this depth remained unrecognized.
It is not yet claimed whether the racket should be used for starting or bremsing the drain.
This information is from the timely pressure.
In 1933, the Poland infanteria began to be discussed with rackets.
The research work was conducted by the Institute Mobile Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Miečislaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrickiegi.
From the documents provided, it is evident that the research was planned for practical tests until the stage.
The research was then freely interrupted by the inmarcing of the German potential.
In 1937, the project of a photo-electric jagdrake, which stabbed by Ing. Rohoziński, was designed, and in the next year the work "Rakieta - torpeda poõna i raketobomba lotnička" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects were involved in the military use of the racket.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of the racket technology were coordinated by the provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Timtimes Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, his work was completed from the beginning of war.
More articles on the roadway will be made after the war thanks to the work of the Poland Room Travel Society (Polski Astronautic Association) in the Poland press.
The first exhibition of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four major articles of the space travel are listed.
The article of Prof. M. Subotovicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space carrier company.
At the time, there were already the first projects for satellite technology, and it was to determine that the research of the Worldra future would have the future.
At its beginning in 1956, the Poland Room Travel Society PTA tried to approach the 1951-based International Føderation for Room Travel, and actually the PTA was already a regular member in Herbst 1956.
In the following year, the first PTA president, Kazi Méd Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was president of the International Føderation for Room Travel.
This office had been in 1959 until death.
Since 1956, the PTA has participated substantially in the development of the extreme ororological racket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Poland racket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on 10 October 1958.
The racket with a maximum flight of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not grow totally 5 kg.
Later, a improved version built by RM-1A, and 1959 started in the wilderness of bugdów with the two-step RM-2.
The rakete was 1,4 m long and grew about 11,5 kg.
Another development level should already be able to provide real scientific work - the RM-34 rakete should get a flight from up to 14,5 km and be used for the monitoring of high-wind winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was established.
Following the first rackets of the type RM, the meteor-1 racket was developed in the 1962 to 1965.
The rakete was conceived as two-stock rackets, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this racket, which were different from the size of the transport ra® for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rackets are over a transport space with 0.4 litres of fixing capacity, meteo-1B over 0.34 litres and meteo-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight was 37 km at all three types of types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rackets were developed in the air carrier Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg use load at a height of approximately 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
In 1960, Polish approach to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) was also valuable, for two years later, followed by the establishment of a national CoSPAR Committee.
Poland also participated in the World Space Research with Soviet Satellites in the framework of the Interkosmos Programme, and in 1978 the Poland Pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became a second intercose monaut after the Czech Vladimir.
The derogation of the law on useful work is not a solution.
In the last week, the Constitutional Court raised the law on useful works.
This decision has made a vital debate in the public.
It is probably interesting to consider the problem once from a larger perspective.
The liberal oriented economic systems in the EU and the globalized world are based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.
Finally, this means that individual people's economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason is that the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of the capital, which is in hand with a free financial inspector.
As a result of the large subsequences of the value of work (balance) it is to prices.
Under this term, a state is to be understood by the manufacturer attempting to exist by importing profitable goods in the economic competition by "submitting the competition" to increase the market share in itself and to increase its winning.
In a large manner, this means to the majority of the enterprises to put their production into the foreign or to buy their business, or to put their business in place, which is a high unemployment in countries with comparable high work.
Since the capital does not have social responsibility and thus does not have any responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, the State expenditure must be increased.
This situation is still strengthened by the ladies of the undertaking to be absolutely unnecessary to buy their taxes and thus to replace the social and social damage caused by them.
This situation is general, so concrete statistics are overflow at this point.
The unconscious practice of the capital makes a situation in which the governments are forced to join the competition in order to reduce the social level of their own population and thus decrease foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments provide their own population without prejudice to the social consequences of capital.
This is, in particular, the amendments to the applicable laws.
The objective of these measures is to force its own population to accept the capital dictate, in particular in the salary area.
This happens to an economic force in long-term unemployment, another by restricting the rights of employees.
The result is growing poverty, as well as even greater differences between arm and kingdom.
In Germany, a few years ago, there are public food taxes for arms that are not able to eat by their own work.
The number of employees already goes into the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it will be regularly in cases where the employees receive such a low wage that the State must take up its income until the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of employed help forces in the German Bundesday.
The Spar action practically all EU-south countries will certainly go out to the same condition in which people are forced to immigrate (as in the 19th century), or to work for a hunger remuneration at the border of the society, and to hope that a private investment capital will flow in the country.
This is naturally the question of what this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, the poverty turns from one country to another; or the capital remains equal, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Marokko, Egypt or Africa, the employees work in general for a fraud of the loans.
This is about the whole Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the State is not able to share capital in its own national economy and that the planning is leading to economic catastrophe.
The capital holds strongly on the position that the State is not able to enter into the economy.
But then you must ask if the capital does not affect the entire State in its own egoistic sense or that it will be linked to the entire country.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically powerful lobby and in all countries.
The result is a disadvantaged situation in the field of corruption, the mutual preference, the legislation, in which practically everything is straight, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a State Ministry has lack of private financials, close to the industry's criminal legal undertakings, with the processing of legislative drafts.
These legislative drafts will then be supplied on the Bundesday.
All violence is then no longer out of the people, as the Western Constitutions are announced, but of strong financial groups who have their own interests.
Of course, the liberal democracy has now been quickly in a situation, as Appian in - works on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of César and Pompeius ': "The State has already been understood in disaster for a long time, and the emergency has been occupied with violence.
In contrast to the mixture, by unusual sharing of benefits or with stone and worth.
The corruption grows secretly, and the people went with already covered voices to choose" ... "The people with characters didn't warn themselves for their owners, so that the State had no consulus for eight months ago" ... "The only medication in this serious situation had to be a single rulership, and that a strong man had to be chosen"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then s Â Cäsar, who was permanently replaced by the democracy by the only rulership.
As it is shown, today's society is also based on the unconscious preferences of its own benefit, without taking account of community interests.
The capital has already been able to recognize and carry out the benefit of the whole society.
The result today as that is an exampleless decade of elite who do not try to deeply reform.
Therefore, we need to look for the cause of the income of physicist and communism in the undeserved liberalisation of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's state, the decline of this regime can be considered as a certain pause for liberal democracy in which the next department is already being taken away.
The fact that today's elite is that the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters whose witnesses we are already today, as well as the crimes against mankind, as we know them from the older and new history, are in perfect ignorance.
The derogation of the Law on useful work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent.
Under the pressure of the global and economic competition, Czechland will also be forced to continue to search for ways to press the population's social level below.
This trend is therefore systematic.
The only solution is political-social reforms aimed at increaseing the capital share of the State in the economy, to increase the influence of the citizens on the government and to delay the monopolation of the capital in the society in favour of the State.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"... that nothing comes from violence, or may ever occur," Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...you don't forget how we are crazy" .
"If my sons didn't want war, don't there be any," says the dead Good Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wall of violence between Israel and the Gaza stream, there was, as always, a number of reactions.
They stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they face the Palestinians as terrorists; others again under the Palestinians, they argue with the racism of the Israelian State, with the murder of the Palestinian Arabians and the Israeli State as a terrorist.
I do not want to write to this place about who in these continuing walls of the murderer and who is victims; finally, the people of Israel today have been born into the current political situation and have not received the beginning of violence.
I am concerned to open the readers the cup behind the cules, the cup of whose 95 years of spending (recovered by the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small flecking country in the Near East.
My thoughts are partly on accessible historical characters, others are led from this and come out of my own understanding of who or what group of people have significantly influenced the events of the modern history.
The history of mankind is in the first line a story of the battle about the power.
At any time, we can make a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether these personalities were actually always themselves that determined their steps automatically, or if there was someone behind his throne who linked their actions to an appropriate goal.
We must imagine that we live in a time where the world's riches are in hand of less individuals, and that this concurrence of money and the outcome power has not occurred within the level of life of a generation.
Under these astronomic rich families, a particularly highlight that can be seen as the head of the crack (I don't know whether anybody is on them, but I'm not locking this) - the roots.
It is not written about them.
It's understandable.
The first Presse Agency (Reʹs) has already been covered by the Rothschild in the 90s of the 19th century to connect its name with high-criminal acts, in which the establishment of their power, increasement of their capacity or both was always in their background.
The roots are shared in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries where they are not shared in the central banks, they lead to wars or strikes to these (before the overcome of Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the overcome of Iraq, five countries, after the trip of Ghaddafis, only four countries, where Russia has submitted its central bank of the Russian Government in the meantime).
Anybody who tried to resist this family had to live with it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, started to release their own (speak: State) banknotes and was killed in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy started to issue its own banknotes and wanted to decrease the FED - he was killed in 1963; Mr. Louis McFadden was deteriorated in 1936 after he wanted to reject the FED because of the global economic crisis in 1929.
The global power costs of the Rothschild led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the dissolving of three world wars by Albert Pik, a free waller of the 33th and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was intended to remove the large monarchist states of Europe, in particular by the Second War, the Colonial Government of the United Kingdom should be broken, and the war would reduce the world population to approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number of these would ensure their aptitudes and their Luxus and would also not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the area) and lead to the overcome of the absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families with the roots on the top is the solution to a crisis and the next boat of a solution (order from chao - order from the chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to a disaster of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that the crisis as they were resolved in 1907 will not be repeated).
After they were taught by the murder at the Habsburger Tronforter Ferdinand in Sarajevo to solve the First World War, they deceived the Russian Zarenish through the revolution of the Bolschewikens.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfair capital of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zarene Rica no longer needed), then the resolution of the Mediterranean Great Potence of Austria and Hungary resulted.
In order to simplify the Second World War, the banks were allowed to create a late conflict situation by establishing Germany with gigantic war reparation; thus they cut down the condition of armed masses, so that they had to subjugate the Germans only a sufficient powerful leader who offered the guilty and simple solutions; another one was the creation of the Czechoslovakia country with a strong German minority that would take the function of a fifth column and also to simplify the war fire.
In the end of the 19th century, the roots started the creation of the tionistic movement, at which a branch tried to establish a Jewish country, as possible in the history of Judea with Jerusalem as a capital city (Ruck-to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was first coherent with the inhabited Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War is exposed, and if Hitler is now lost from the Kette, where the international bankers had first kept him, or whether everything was planned, it is only difficult to appreciate, at any time the suffering of the Jews in the conspiration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish State through the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as the war reparation against Germany of the Earth for the Second World War, the calling of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers are able to defeat this war, the Jewish people will be like in the Second World War as a victim in the first battle line, this time together with the Arabic or Muslim population of the Near East.
Israel is like a large lab, a source of fighting and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also in the international (remember just how people are sharing in the enemies and enemies of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where the unrighteousness is only in an infinite spiral of violence, and at the beginning the deadness of individuals and their efforts for global power?
There must be a distinction between the people of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as we, the people, have to choose their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falk-Netaniahu, is a typical example of a fascist and loyally granted to the international bankers to deal with a war with the Iran, which, as regards Iran's membership in the Shanghai Group of Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly extend to a global conflict, and it could be due to Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, which could run over 20% of the world's earthquake.
In which light the words David Rockefellers appear from 1994: "The only thing we need is a wholesome crisis, and people will welcome the new world rule."
In their opinion, the new world rule is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to undermine this existence of total control.
"And it makes the little and the great, the riches, the poor, the free and the servants all give a sign on their right hand or on their bridge that no one can buy or exhaust, but he has the name of the animal, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: whoever has understanding, he shall consider the number of animals.
For it is a number of men, and his number is six hundred six and six."
The Argo movie: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a monster of islamic students demonstrated the US message in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as a colleagues.
For their release, they requested the delivery of the deteriorated shahs Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was after the revolution to the United States, which had kept the patronate over his regime over a year.
For the Government of the Ananias, there was no positive outcome from this situation - she couldn't allow it to throw the view over the board, because this would have protected massively the trust of their associates in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to be in the Iran where the revolution was able to implement a theocratic regime to the release of the women.
It was a severe trial for the call of the United States, and then Fiasko made everything worse during the violent trial of freedom.
The arrested diplomats were released after 444 days after negotiations were sent by the Algerian Government.
The shickshall of the islands called to home a wall of solidarity and anti-Iran votes.
The debate in Iran was significantly supported by Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan at the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the Regisher and the player Ben Affleck describes a episode of this story, which protected the United States a small parts.
Just before the message was assigned, six news workers fled.
This ended after a number of complex in the residence of the Canadian messenger.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, there was an extravagant story to cover their reality - they traveled with Canadian feet as members of a film stage, which seemed to be visited in the country Trihorte for a Science-Fiction film.
Combination of Genres
The "Exfiltration Expert", Tony Mendez, developed plan, also made Hollywood's cooperation necessary.
In order to believe the tension, the articles on this film project have been held in the periods, press conferences were held, and the fixed production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been secreted long. The movie implies the reminders of Tony Mendez.
Defleck movie is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realist polythriller, but at the same time also a sog. "Caper Film", such as the story of a learned household stick, such as the Ocean's eleven film.
Thus, the film changes the voting levels - on one side the Teheran documents (in the title sequence, iconic timegenous photographs are shown, and also in the summary of the same situations there are no large subsequences).
On the other hand, the locker passports from Hollywood, which is ironic and easy to overspeak, so.
And then there are still the scenes from the central and other institutions - men in relation to the meeting table, on the offices, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is learned with this film a significant restart of his car.
From a observed spectacular player has become a respectable ruler, and he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his play movie after Crime No child game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without G日 (2010).
At the same time, it's the first film that doesn't play in the home boston of the ruler.
The speech for the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that previously removed the films from the standard Hollywoods.
However, this discovery also shows in Argo, where Teheran of Canada is "played".
The best scenes of the film are playing in the streets and showing the reconstruction of events that really have found place - the income sequence of the destruction of the message is very impressive in their supervisibility, but it provides the feeling of confusion and invisibleness, which occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Similar effect results in deflection with team also in fictitive scenes (the wrong film stab on a base in Teheran).
Too much action at too many places
The ruler also had to avoid that the story offered not many stressing scenes in the film sense.
With the weight, though, he is right, where he sometimes helps the reality - which is not always so elegant (the scenes in which the severe crisis on the aircraft in Teheran is rejected by a telephone in America, or also the persecution year on the starting road are sometimes a good effect).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide stress, which is conditioned by the need to show too much in action to many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood workers, but their figures would have deserved more room, and so they are not alone in the movie.
This is a movie that can be followed with a certain interest, and thus the design and the retro-style of the 70s-year-called retro-style.
However, he is just awakening hard.
However, as a reminder of a living part of history and as a evidence of how the ideas of all powerful and all-known secret services are, it is sufficient.
Directives for the survey of airballons, bananas and circles
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who appoints an annual investigation on the most absurd bank taxes, has decided this year to comply with the "Afjure Regulation or Idee from the EU workplace".
"On this idea, we have been able to introduce a 40% female quota from the EU in the management of large companies," said Patrik Neer, who cares about the organization of this investigation, against the journal Pravo.
In the nominated absurdities, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the Association of Insurance Staff for Men and Women.
Even so, women enjoy a benefit in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Incredibly unbelievable incidences from the EU's workplace can be nominated until the end of this year.
The vote will then be made until the end of February 2013,” shared the follower.
The contrary EU Regulations include the commitment of bioethanol to fuel, which is naturally concerned, the prohibition of the trusted cheese thermometers only because they contain a relatively small quantity of this substance, or also the Directive on the size of the eggs of eggs that have been significantly contaminated in this year.
In the past, the actual prohibition of the use of the term "Buther upstrech" or the sale prohibition for original clusters was also decreased in the past.
Bananes must be 14 cm long
The EU facility often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, which normally represents requests in Brussels by one or more Member States (e.g., Czechland is currently trying to implement the requests of the Czech banks with Veto.
Lobby interests also included that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and that no "crossing analysia" can be shown.
The European Commission defended it with the argument that they would only harmonize the uninstitutional national standards that would prevent trade.
The standards regarding fruit and vegetables have already been highlighted by the EU against the opposition of some countries, indicating that the current directives would lead to a pollution of food.
A candidate for the winning in this survey may be the EU Regulation of the last year, which must be noted in accordance with the statement that children under eight years do not be able to broke the airballon without a wake.
The EU has been identified by an ananas, which, according to airballons, is the leading cause of the death of children.
Similar limitation is already applied for children to 14 years in the use of years.
Curiose cases are also home
Relatively absurd is also a directive relating to the own officials - everyone who takes an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of Greece's theme and must say that FYROM (former Yugoslavia of 日a).
The server Bankopoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Liberal Economy Connection Laissez Faire, as well as the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies in a Member State.
Thus, the EU defined the high-compatibility of food proposals that would be able to be on the day of our EU accession in the area of the Czech Republic.
Czechland then exceeds, for example, the fixed volume for steel conservations, which threatened a high money penalty for us.
The investigation organisations were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money to have no sea or the idea of payment for payments for payments.
These ideas were freely not from Brussel, but from Prague.
"We are inclined to have no sea.
We will be refunded in the EU," the Dunch Ministry of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ChSSD) said in herbst 2004.
As a argument, he concluded that the greenhouse was very high and that the State camps were also overflowed by the intervention buyes.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to have seahaven, the EU should call Palas hundreds of millions of euros to us.
The European Commission found the Czech Republic as far as it organized a statement on the acquisition of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
In addition to payments for payments for contributions, the Ministry for Regional Development has invited the Communities under the management of Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), it should be particularly involved in the establishment of subsidiary requests to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception
However, regulations in the Member States will be easier for the objective of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, and thus the impact and development of the entire Union, according to the opinion of some experts.
A seriouser problem, as these experts consider, is the EU's subsidiaries for projects that are not along with the intensification of the integration, but which have been encouraged in the budget negotiations of some Member States.
Emotions also call on the fact that Czechland is like other Member States in Brussels to fight the right to use specific labels of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
However, after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, Czechland could defend the name "Olomoucké tarobobky", the inland space (Tuzemski rum), whose tradition returned to us until the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename to "tusmake".
The name Rume shall only be used for products of sugar destillate, not for sugar rubber products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the worldly originated cheese species Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Mar
With a EU mark, the pardubicer libcuchen or the horicer Rollen can be breaked.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how is it that you can candidate for the President's office?
I'm not going to be Senator or President.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I wouldn't candidate anywhere.
But I can't see how the Republic has been planned for 20 years, how the Debe runs freely, while people are increased in taxes and rental age.
I had no ambitions to become more.
But if I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am already more than 40, which is independent and partial, I have no other way to influence the things than to candidate to the office of a Senator or of the President.
In the Senate you've done it and then you've made you on the road to the village.
Do you not turn your electors back?
I've told me all the time I'd take the battle around the village after the result of the Senate Waals.
Later, I did this and said that I would be candidate to the Office of the President if I was chosen to the Senator.
My goal is not the function, but the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
That is why I need much influence and a most strong mandate.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we are a people in the neighborhood and the television, but we do everyone who wants to change something.
It comes to the media that want to make one the honour, and to change the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was claimed that I would spent journalists or that I was adviser of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The battle around the village you have taken with the Tees of the material and criminal detention of persons and with re-effective reactions over 20 million crowns.
You have to change the laws.
As President, you have no power in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can introduce legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have made it possible for the leader to remain a free holding, and this could be done.
The problem is the small geisticity, if someone comes from the right or left with a good proposal, it is clearly rejected, and that is only the people who are able to stop.
As independent parties, I have a much greater potential to gain support to all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take the best for our country without shadows and part-dogs from each party.
Do you look like a man in the face right or left?
From the Czech view, I think the people see me left.
For me, this right-link thinking is totally insignificant.
It's important for me to continue.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect the people.
I always undertake every good solution, even if this comes from the KSCHM or the ODS, and I will also turn away from bad ideas.
You're missing if someone's getting you as a popular.
But don't you do that by what you just said?
If you build a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And this is what you want to draw close to.
It is possible for me to be popular, but all the proposals I have spoken are already working in the world, or they have been examined by important experts.
But without support in the Parliament, you are only a keyword.
And that's what you do not get in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people enough, you will be able, for example, to carry out material and criminal detention?
I don't have any other chance.
To convince journalists and publicity and to try to bring them to our side to implement these objectives.
As the President, it would not be a problem for me to invite the presidents of the parliamentary parties living in television to legally enhance the material and criminal denunciation for employees, officers, judges and state advocates.
And the languages should then say why they refuse this.
A strong personality that refers to disasters can exercise pressure on the political scene.
Only once the direct election of the President, which was a service for public pressure.
I'm clear that I'm an amateur; I'm not a genius or a intellectual.
I'm trying to find associates for my views and visions.
I just started and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to evaluate the things myself; and if it doesn't fail, I'll return to the sector in six years.
It sounds a little like Okamura Czech should save.
I'm not a saver.
I know that I don't get anything alone; therefore, I have spoken with several persons about whether they would not even want to candidate for the Senate.
For example, I talked to Radim Jančura, but refused to carry out work.
I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the disturbance in trade with light oil.
My candidate started with the condition that people are deeply uncomfortable, but now I'm not sure.
Seventy percent of the electoral rights have not gone to the elections, and most of the representatives of the establishment have chosen.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
People have chosen such a settlement that changes will only be very difficult to be transmissible.
However, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of citizens and the officers of the officers.
Do you think of the establishment of a party?
I have not yet followed this because I have no time to check the past of any potential party members, and I don't even have the money for it.
I have no money for the President's campaign; on my transparent account there are only 200,000 CZK.
You don't have money?
You're talking about assets, how do you look like?
I appreciate my ability to approximately 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a baseline with a value of 25 million, a apartment for approximately 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection that is worth approximately 10 million, as well as a aston Martin for 3.5 million and a schodu Superb, which is a million value, and then I have a few million on the account.
Moreover, the Aston Martin was a child dream - James Bond’s dream has always been to me how he was in the car, galant to women, and at the same time struggle against evil.
Are you driving a Aston Martin, having 60 million liabilities and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but your own money you don't want to invest in it.
That's not exactly convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make some faults?
I've already cut 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not too interested.
And I am not obligated to fight the campaign from my own resources.
The costs for the campaign are based on my content as a Senator.
But I could not live by the Senator's holding alone; for example, I could not financ my son the English School that costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to deserve money, I wouldn't candidate for anything.
So do you continue to be undertaken to have your outcome?
Didn't you say you're going to get back these Assets?
But this doesn't relate to the height of the content.
As I'm promising, I've partly returned my Assets.
For example, my officer will be held in the early year of the travel business leader.
People want to see me as Samaritan who save the Republic.
But I have to live from something.
To what month's income were you used as a subsequent?
Approximately 200,000 to 400,000, and that is also the way.
As the President, however, I would completely set my undertakings.
The full appointment will be found in the Saturday issue of Pravo.
The MVRDV architects show that the real aventures are not only in the head - for example of spikekinis and the latest bookberg - 2 photos
"I find the building fun, it looks futurely, and finally there's something interesting to see again," Lisette Verhaig says, a passenger at the road border.
And Stefan Spermon, IT-techniker in a nearby big operation, says, "No, it's pretty, the house."
But I wonder why we need another booking today.
All have Internet, iPad and E-Books.
No man is going to be voluntary today in one of these old-style libraries, right?
Spiekenisse, a little needed sleeping city before the rotterdams gate, is a recordable recorder.
The 80,000 inhabitants community shows the lowest education rate in the whole Netherlands.
In order to resist this stupid situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general training and to rebuild the seven ficticial brains presented on the euros as beautifully defined steel beton miniatures.
The success of education openly remained in frontiers.
And so the town fathers recognized that there is only one opportunity to become the statistical Lord: a library must be here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdamer Architectural Office MVRDV, the master of the famous Balken graphs and product of white, so often Zionic buildings, took the thing with habitual opportunity and appeared to competition hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a grind in the view.
And while the Jury was still deceived to look and touched with the axes, the fresh Maas stood his reading mass of size according to a pyramide and ended his actionisticly underwatered talk with the words: "Look, city community!"
This is, therefore, my proposal for the bookerberg of Spiekenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros have been cut up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also belongs to deep garage, super, post and a few limited residents and order houses with a total of 50 apartments.
Start of November the bookberg was issued with the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is nominated for the National Wood Award 2012.
This is the unseenly small city tretor, which had no longer been offered as a postmodal footpasser zone and an unconscious hazardous rate, behind which white fashions you would have been able to convince a molecular factory to acquire a part of modern architecture.
In particular, however, Spijkenisse is now over the first public culture in the history of his existence.
The long way to book
First impression: bookereldorado under kissing.
Although there is a lift that leads through the mountain massive, the true room and reading friends will be opened in the footnote of the toophography.
The round inner room is light and surprised, the burned clinners and the elegant road latters speak unexpectedly the language of a public city.
The urban environment is perfect.
You're already looking at Parkbank, dogs and football boys and boys playing.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally the book rules are near the fashion, and in the middle of the middle of a large, dark space, which is most inappropriate and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and fill the reading area from inside to outside.
The inner of the bookberg is correctly sent: In the middle of Offices, Internet libraries, shach clubs, environmental areas and household technology centtrale.
A special pleasure is the black book rules, which are once wall clothing, when wearing, when they are stainlands.
Optical, haptic and geruch are outside.
Even incorporated architects and building architects shoot the head on the unknown building.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the City Common Spiekenisse, on request of the standard.
And thus we have been shot in a free landscape of agriculture one day on a complex waste product from agriculture.
Since many years, in the Netherlands, a milestorm of plastic oil has been used as a root undertaken in the Netherlands.
That's fair and timely.
The dark textile holds one, two seasons, and then it's fair for the lock.
For the library, the Vlies was first pressed in these quantities to four centimeter thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that drives a bissl after new cars and a bissl to sportshot.
After 105 steps, you've been reached at the rubber.
At the end of almost 500 metres long warranty, not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with netherlands croquets and smooth ficus trees are rewarded in literature cafe.
They care for atmosphere, especially for the right air fuels in literature.
Seccion for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is a project of preview in pointo ecology, despite many glass areas," says Trouborst.
Ironed and refrigerated with earthquake.
Although the bookerberg is under a glass turtle, the sun itself seems to be in the sun only short inside.
The wide tree limbs, which are to the glass fascinate, serve as a taxation and begin a large part of the sun stretching.
The space climate is very pleasant.
The full-automatic roles are performed.
Stefan Spermon, the starting skeptical from the IT broadcast, already waited the way to the new booking.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, which holds the Boekenberg as a "longer overcome soul".
The reason: For a few weeks ago, each inhabitant was invited to make a book from personal stock s.
This is the first time that the optical libraries in the library that is not yet completely covered - now, 70,000 pieces.
The concept has been started.
The rules are up to top.
"Nothing is worse than a halfer library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just too bad.
This is what MVRDV has learned of the king's dissilin, which is called in the pharmacist.
Spikeenis wrote literature story.
That's how young and unimaginable she likes to be.
This is finally an attachment to the efficiency.
Szabo: "The German must play greater role"
Germany has voted on the vote of Palestina.
According to Stephen Szabo, US European Relations Expert, balances Berlin with a small diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week, Germany had signaled that it would vote against the request for a supervisory status of the Palestinians at the United States.
But then, Berlin's coming.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it doesn't support the position of Ananias.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence, however, without being too critical against Israel.
During the resistance in Libya in March 2011, Germany also included the vote when it was to establish a flight forbidden zone.
This was implemented by the NATO.
Is Germany difficult to take a clear position in important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is the fact that it is just implementing its external policy, and that it has been removed from one of the United States to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult that the Europeans do not have coherent and uniform.
Thus, the Germans are located between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used.
I think they were still on their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" external policy.
A foreign policy such as France or Greece.
What does a "normal" external policy mean than specific from German view?
It shows the willingness to treat national interests also positions independent of those of the United States or partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, thus by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Near East.
German economic interests are in a certain degree different from the other large powers, and therefore Germany must have its interests.
Has these economic interests affected the attitude in the neighborhood conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
For one thing, Germany has a large part market in the Near East, especially in the Golf States.
Therefore, it must be careful that the public, but also the Elites, do not stand before the head in the Arab countries.
It plays a role in any case.
But I wouldn't even want to have too much weight, that is not a completely single relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German discussions.
Has Germany threatened his relationship with the United States by having the vote in important decisions, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I don't think this was a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have a certain respect.
Because it signals that it is to be taken seriously as international players and needs to take care of his interests.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
However, the United States have clearly spoken to a Veto.
Is there differences between the United States and many N日?
Because of the internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the government under Obama has a lot of understanding for the position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position.
I think the real differences of thinking are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and the Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so lightly pleased by Netanjahus.
Is Germany difficult to agree with his close relationship with Israel and the United States on the one, and the position of the major partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform Property, which is not the case.
So they can't be part of a larger line, and they have to predict these things from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will take a leading role to put Europe into a position.
Of course, this is not simply for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
It was always a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Is Germany himself in the role of a major international player - would Germany at all take a major role?
Or does Germany still fall on the role of the leadership?
Germany has not yet been used, it is still unappreciated and, for evident reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role in the country.
For example, when we look at the Eurocrisis, it will be free every time Germany accepts a greater role, different anti- German feelings.
That doesn't make the Germans easy.
This is the old problem: you don't want to be circumcised by enemy countries.
This is how Germany is seen in a much weaker position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States on the EU continues, but the EU doesn't take place at the moment of this vaccine, who else remains there?
The Germans will just have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it, it is unappreciated to them, and it makes them much more unnecessary - it's la life!

"Marken Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a worldwide mark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
What's Armani Polo?
In this context, a very officially invoked category in China, which, however, does not have anything to do with the original companies.
However, she enjoys the long protection as the name providers do not claim.
And even then it's not clear whether they're right.
"It will always be more difficult for foreigners to säm their marks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the Taylor Wessing office, which is specialized on protective rights damage in Fernost.
Every week there's a new case on my desktop.
The neighbors already have a few additional letters in order to notify their marks.
So it will be from Gua simply Lu-Gu, instead of Prada you let a Prada-Kny in.
In addition, German companies are legally copied, such as the Sport Articles Manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries in Peking.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese enterprise allowed the brand of Zegna DF Puma, a artist name that also served at the home of Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese world masters are in copying and lost spiritual property is it.
In the large towns, there are multiple buy houses that almost excite falsehoods.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: In his mandate, it suggests that Chinese undertakings from the Marketing Authority receive the right to use a name which has already been used differently.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a traveler mark.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
That's what women are able to enjoin rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not have any responsibility.
"This is businessful, you have to fight it," Pattloch requests.
"The mark is disappointed, the only setting disappears, the pictures' damage is great."
The financial accidents and processing of the broadcastings are going to millions, especially in fair preliminary products.
According to the CLSSA market research company, China is a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the largest market for Luxus articles and the fastest growth.
However, the elimination of dubios inputs in the Marking Richters is difficult to get and go to money.
By nine years, the procedure can take place with an unwise outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the Court has rejected claims because after the long time of the "marke reality" name has been made.
If the complainant has Pech, he must even buy money to the Plagiator because he hurt his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes here is the law of the jungle.
Favorite cases also relate to graphical elements.
2009, Daimler lost a legal fight with the treasure manufacturer Sany, the company who recently took the German beton puzzle builder.
Therefore, Chinese can use an emblem that is like Mercedes stars until today.
The Volvo Buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that noted BMW; the fight was held, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of Lacoste was lost in China against Nahamer from Hong Kong and Singapore, who left the famous crocodile in other directions.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of their fault.
The Market CTMO in Peking indicates that it has been given in 2010 for less personal and space sales in 2010.
In the past year, however, the "Notsituation in the workshop is returned to normality".
This is the case that the file is injured by 22 Pro.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 in the Office are still expected to be performed.
In contrast, it costs much
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year, more than 1,4 million mark protection applications were introduced in CTMO, almost one third of the 2010.
This is a record and means that China for the next time introduces the list of new logins worldwide, the Authority shares.
This also paid for the content of all valid mark marks, in total 5.5 million pieces.
2011 1,8 billion Yuan were taken on taxes.
It simplifiedly means that each notice in 1280 Yuan or 160 euros costs.
Nevertheless, it costs a simple cost, as the case of the German family undertaking shows joynberg.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against a Chinese plagiator.
For the reasons, the Germans could find that its illegal manufacture of immitted vehicles was exhausted.
However, the follower continued to secure the Chinese rights on the mark of joynberg.
It has been disappointed by itself because family names could not be seized in Germany, Hanno Wentzler, the president of the business management of the Chemical Specialities in München.
The Marketing CTMO has shown the income of the Münchens.
In the next two instances, the joyberg was correct, but the processing enemy continues to continue until today.
You need to be careful.
Now the matter is attached to the Master Court of Justice.
Wentzler is convinced to bring the thing to a good conclusion, and lo ́ the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely external and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs have not been allowed to make evidence that the company archive has to have even a hundred years of old acts.
Five years ago, the “height-six-six-sixth euro” offered the opposite enjoyment of the counterpart.
"It's why you see how much it worth us," Wentzler says.
The provinces in Fernost were even moving back to Europe.
Well, then, if the imitators are safeguarded by unseen marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to notify the name of joynberg for shoes and leaders.
This business field has given the concern longer, however he could reject the registration.
"You have to be careful," Wentzler says.
While he and the lawyer Pattloch advised German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to leave international mark rights, but the strangers should "all that is worthwhile, even in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can become much more furious than the registration.
In fact, if you are understood in the last act of his mark drama, you would like to put the opposite license charges for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be driven out of the market in the questionary segment.
World Daily: Stamps, songs, help
In Heidelberg pro · the Chor Imbongi - and in Swaziland, Aids are glad of it.
The story of a connection that overcomes more than 8733 km.
First, there is the stamp: Cowboystifel, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and lords lippers find the takt on the parked bottom, find him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the songs are slowly thrown up - Alt, Bass, Tenor and Sopran - hurt and persecute themselves.
And Fite Hopf, the 29-year-old director, has almost made it out of his substance shoes when he brings them together with his preventive gestures.
It's Montagabed, a new song in the Music of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg pro日 of the Chor Imbongi.
The fifty songs and songs have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetic to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple track, each cross vote has another text and it is also in a very strange language: Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mosambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Assistance to self-aid
There are around 34 million HIV inhibitors worldwide, which appreciates Unids, the United Nations programme for combating AIDS.
23,5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland lives 245 000 AIDS.
More than 40% of the population are HIV-effective.
For 180 AIDS wheels in the village of Esitenti, the United Voices for Africa Paten found in Germany.
70 of them visit a continuing school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take a patentship.
It guarantees the child school payment, schooluniform and a warm feed each day in the Gogo Centre.
Imbongi means Zulu historical teller or also lobpriser.
The Bantu日 fleeing can speak no one in this room but sing.
For almost £ years, the Chor Li ́ practices in this foreign language and brings them away and returns to where they originately come: in South Africa.
Because 8 733 km airline from Heidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitdien, which depends on the voice of the German Chores.
Fourteen Pro's are injected.
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple lehm and electricity houses, a majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are brought to HI-virus.
In Eritzien, the small one in which the whole Swaziland is sick is: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest expectation of life worldwide sounds unique.
Restrictions of the human preventions that are evidently reduced by the risk of deterioration are not accepted by the population.
More than 40 people in Swaziland, the immune virus in itself to die with the middle of three-thirds, is not rare.
In a common African journey in early 2005, the Chor discovered the village, and especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets where it was not only in older prejudices, but in all: Eating, clothing, education.
Without school conclusion, you have no chance in a poor country.
First, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros per year and to allow him a warm feed day.
However, a year later, the Chor found the "Voices for Africa", which is almost professionally concerned about the AIDS-ways in Esitzien.
Infections to sexually transmissible
What are the most important sexually transmissible diseases?
The bacterial STIs are Sy日lis, Chlamydian and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Common viral STI are HIV, human papilomavires, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Fills and crates belong to the parasitary STI.
Who are the main groups?
Hisselflis and trippers, especially in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Cook Institute suggests that at least four of the five of the cases in Germany have been reported by sexual contacts between men.
In the eterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonade, candidose, tripper and human papilomavires are often sexually transmissible diseases.
The spread of HIV is similarly low among theerosexual adults - even though: 20% of HIV-new infections fall on this group.
Clamydian infections are essentially more frequent than in other population groups.
After highlighting, three quarters of all infections are young people between 15 and 25 years.
In addition, human papilomavires are often present in youths.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmissible diseases are clear.
The number of Sy日lis infections was more than doubled by the Robert Cook Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has returned since 2007.
2011 was about 2700 cases.
This is about a decimal less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate to a sexual disease?
Infection illnesses can result in the genital area, disturbance in urination, exhaust, disturbance, and bleeding or warm.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and thus remain unobserved.
How can you go?
Condoms can reduce the risk of depreciation, but they do not offer a hundredproproof protection.
Because in part, heating of sexually transmissible diseases can also be transmitted by smiley infections and body contacts.
As a result, experts, in particular, were recommended regular investigations in generally changed sex partners.
Previously, most STI can be healed and avoided afternoon.
By patents, S., and not lately, the gages that the Chor sing in all Germany come together.
"In general, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitdien," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the United States.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and implementing woman, the money from Germany.
She also cares about that the waves are well undergone, with one of the grandmothers around.
The Gogos, as you call the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 waives, give them a cup over the head and ensure that children in their uniforms seem to appear at school every day.
Whoever has no more, comes to the house of protection to Khanyisile, a single woman, which is paid by the unit as the two kids cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Furthermore, "Voices for Africa" has called a nearby school, built two houses and organized PSI together with the health organization that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not self-intelligence, because the illness is also in the whole country, and it is the most lovely dead.
A King with 14 Marriages
"Aids is a absolute tab," says Annette Lennartz, "for it has sex."
In fact, rarely in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute Monarch Black Africas, King Mswati III., is for his ex-Life style.
Polygamy town of Democracy.
In addition, this stately sanctified life form has also been charged that the HI virus has spread so quickly in the past year.
But also the many workers who have the virus through the country.
Annette Lennartz says, "but they will not be useless.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels all two, three years together through South Africa, and Li ́ sing full of wehmut, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, many in the southern side of the black continent, even from the time of the apartheid.
A bus full of white men who sing in a black language - so much recognition brings not only voice and joy, but also some wrathful border soldiers have broken a few trees.
The travel also leads to Esitdien, where the songs visit their children.
Even if you do not find the small village on land maps, it is more than .
"Go to Esitenti, there is the light," people say there.
And if you return the 8733 km air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping songs in the tester on the mountainhouse street, you can see it light there.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the mercure
The other Messenger has found evidence of that there is on the Iron Planet.
The iron cover may be thick up to 20 meters.
The NASA in the United States Room Carrier has demonstrated the existence of iron on the planet Merkur.
Although he lies the sun next, there is also a round water in there, as it appears from three lights published on Thursday in the "Science" pharmaceutical.
The other Messenger has found evidence that there is a iron cover in the shadow area of the planet.
It must be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even 20 metres dick.
The water was probably from comets or perhaps asteroids put on the mercury.
No one brings the ice fund, but the existence of life on the planet, said the leader of the Messenger's health, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the funds could help to clothe the water and other buildings of life in other areas of the sun system.
Unobserved by the citizens of the earth are soldiers, telescope and small robots such as Phoenix to investigate the depths of the world.
From time to time, they send pictures to earth: Small guckles in infinite whites.
The picture comes from a camera that developed German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, including the Ceres Clerge Planet.
Like Pluto, who crosses the sun around the sun, Ceres, after the new definition of the International Astronomic Union of 2006, has no "planet".
This image output of an infraroot receipt of the Spitzer Telescope shows an "Family Portrait" unnumbered stars: the oldest stars are to be recognised as blue points, more difficult to identify the pink colors "newborn" in the Star Room.
This star-forming region - of guardians called unromantly W5 - discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star image of Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This brilliant glass of a dead star has taken the Spitzer telescope of the nasa.
The donut-formed ring consists of the material that the stars exploded in the death process.
In the large Trifid Nebel, 5400 Light Years remote from the earth, new stars come from gas and smoke.
The Spitzer telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birth level.

A combination of normal and infraroad photos provides the speecular colouring.
This babyster could be recorded in his full beauty only by the infraroot detectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How these have occurred, is one of the great race of the astronomy.
Perhaps they are the rest of a Saturn Moon, which was unexpectedly disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and warmst records of the Hubble Telescope: Whirlpool gallaxie
By coloring, the records of spiral galaxies will be made to real artworks.
The record published by the European Southest Watch shows the number of thousands of light Years remote trifid mobs in the star image S siee.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (trided, triped) because dark stones depth the lighting heart of the stars-burn stations three parts.
Astronomes have photographed the offers of a cosmical karambolage: 400 million light years from the earth raise the kernels of two mixing galaxies and will be unusually collided.

The photo of the world space telescope Hubble shows an extract from the Irisnebel in the star picture of Kepheus.
The 1400 Light Years remote Nebel is from smooth corners that are up to hundred times smaller than the normal housestuff.
This image was collected from optical and Röntgen receipts of different telescopes.
It shows a ring from black lowers, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, Arp 273, took up the world space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The biggest spiral gallaxie called UGC 1810.
In this starbel, the most luminous group of young stars of our milk road is located.
The starway always produces new Youngsters.
Furthermore, these stars-wolkes, connected to the Rosset-Nebel, brings new baby stars running - 5000 lighty-years from the earth.
In this light streaming galaxie with a small black lock, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe that he has occurred shortly after the urknall when the universe was found a primary water material.
Our views in all: The main telescope
The telescope was found in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilee was set for a year later for the star observation.
Since then, the speeds of optical telescopes have become more - and the ideas they give are always deeper.
30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope in Palomar Observatorium near San Diego was the most remote roof of the world.
The spiegel, here in the picture, had a average of five meters.
The large binocular telescope is in Aríona, the United States.
It allows locks in all equally over two speeds, everyone with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island La Palma is great - only the spiegel comes to 10,4 metres in the diameter.
The Spiegel of South African Great Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Yet, he reached a diameter of about 11 meters.
The advantage of the favourable building: The telescope is fixed in ≥ height angle - and thus restricted in its movement.
Moreover, the Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is fixed in the height angle.
His conditionality: the high light collection force.
This is, at the same time, sufficiently small speed mediators - to the worldwide largest speed telescopes.
With a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to all the outermost signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help each computer owner by providing accounting.
On the observatory of the European Star Wade (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here's the Very Large Telescope - the hold of names makes all honor.
With its total of four mirrors, the remote roof can also clarify the average infraroot spectrum.
Similarly, the European Extremely Great Telescope is planned on the Chilean ESO reservation.
His main level will set 42 metres along and be set together from at least 1000 spider elements.
However, with pictures it is to be calculated before 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Vulkan Mauna Kea were the biggest of the world.
They offer two mirrors at the same time with any average of → meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea observators, watching the subaru telescope and the IRT in heaven.
Moreover, on Mauna Kea, a new, big telescope - with a spiegel middle of 30 metres.
Here it is to be tested on an illustration.
However, the most important inputs from all are provided by the world space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, there are already pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the world space telescope Kepler looks for extrasolated planets - especially for those who are residents.
On 2 February 2011, the Nasa reported that 1235 planet candidates were detected since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the latest starting preparations are documented in the world room telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot at the board of a Ariane5 racket in all.
The primary level of the world infraroot telescope has a diameter of 6,5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the urknall.
Agencies conclude that there is also in the South Pool of Merkur ice.
However, there are no confidential data for this, since the Messenger is far closer to the North Pool around the planet.
Radarma sales have been indicated that there is iron on the iron.
By the 2004 started Messenger health - the first that crossed around the Mercur - the economists now have consciousness.
Daily drinking butter - and 168 years old
In the South Azerbaidian, many people have a Bible - high age.
There is even a museum for long-life.
A trace search in the country in which 97 years are still young.
In the South Azerbaidian, many people have a Bible - high age.
There is even a museum for long-life.
A trace search in the country in which 97 years are still young.
The trip through the Taliban City is called wildromantic.
The small bus runs over the curvenous street, over the nearly controlled hills, riding rivers and simple building houses.
Everything is green and safe, you might think you're in blackwald.
But this is the deepest south of Aserbaidschan, the border to Iran is only a few miles away.
Here is the Kakasian group of the Taliban, from which it is not much, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and asherian and is very long-life.
The final station is Lerik.
The small towns are prosecuted with too highly broken architecture from Soviet times, which do not want to match the Malerian mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are not coming here, the leadership of the Azerbaidschan capital of Baku is too fair.
For the 323 miles, eight hours are spent because the road is just simple.
The famous richness that the country thanks Oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the province.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the evidence of tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision-Song Festival - and in the next year we have a festival of the elderly people of the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum for long-life, it's the only one in the world.
Here the vita is documented of approximately eight thousand talyschen from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
Another child born in age of 136 years
But the conflicted star of the Musee is the shepherd Sherali Muslim, who will be 168 years old.
However, there is no birthtime.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who was 122 years old, the musculomov age seems very doubtful.
"1805 was born here in the region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children geha, in the age of 136 years he would have born another daughter.
Has Sherali myslumov thus been calculated in age about a few years?
But also burnt Scholz, older researcher at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high-beaters in Central Asia.
"In some areas of China, Japan or Hunza-Tal in Pakistan there are many hotfold people," she says Scholz, "and in Sardinia live very many old men."
However, because of failing documents, there is no scientific evidence of the age, including personal staff rulers.
Each day, beauty smiled butter
But it is that the people of the region around Lerik often have a Bible age.
Now there are 20 persons older than 100 years.
So why do you live here in the south?
The Asian Traveller Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talicians.
However, the Directorate of Fatulayeva believes that it is in the food.
However, that the calculation of the calories costs of the Taliban should be so healthy to love meat, bread and especially milk products, and many drink a glass mixed butter daily, it does not appear just plastic from food scientist view.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cengemiran, a vital seating around the city of Lerik, Ruba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years, she is still young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 followers, le ́ in a simple holzaus, which is typically for the entire coastal region.
She's sitting on the ground with a bathroom fashion that she's rolling up and rolling.
Eight people live here under a cup, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughters, both are longer older.
Two little kids also walk around.
In the kitchen, you are preparing the guest tee, which is served in the typical, bulk-formed armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in order and members, under her headhood, she is cut off long, dark blonde creatures that enthusiast her son before us.
I have always cut my hair with milk, so they never went out to me and kept their color.
"Shampoo I never used," Mirzayeva said.
Month rounds enough for life
She's always eating what was from her own court, tomates, cartoffles, herbs.
All my life I haven't purchased only one time in the Super. Food.
Then she told her about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst time after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "love father" Heydar Aliyew took the ruder.
The propaganda sounds rare from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cow that is running around the patriarch of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no limits in Aserbaidschan.
By 2003, he was at the power, later his son Ilham took the ruder.
Always there is no need under the old Azerbaidian.
230 Manat (a.k.a. the same amount in euro), Mirzayeva receives a amount for a monthly round, for yesterday conditions, from which you can live well.
And maybe Mirzayeva's son has the longest time right: "The elderly enjoy our culture's respect."
They live in the middle of the great family, they will be lying, careful and happy.
If this is not a reason to stay as long as possible in life
The word "Music Rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Kairo.
Rivalising powers in Cairo show the deep splitting of the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as a base is extremely contrary.
The Egyptian President did not spare Pathos.
We have to get the transition.
"And that he lies, he lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the state TV.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to the Christian heads, the Liberals, the discovered Muslims, and Sülulars.
Because all of them, until now unexpectedly disappeared in a confusioned opposition, have been.
Before a godly state on the Nil of the grace of the powerful muslimity.
He, thus said Mohammed Mursi almost excuses to restrict the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily and extended its powers to save the revolution.
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who really wants to save a doctor title of the South Californian University, is the Egyptians, the world is not clear.
Whether the Judication should be deleted
In fact, the 234 articles, which were spent partly in a 15-hour parforcery of the islamist constitutional assembly, which was dominated by the 100-country constitutional congregation.
Like in the former Constitutions, the draft is based on the "Princies of Islamic law".
But what do you mean "Princies"?
This was and it was an interpretation and it is to ensure that the islamists will use the weak formulation and the incoming legal game room for a stronger interpretation of the sharia.
This provides at least a new article to be added: In all the cases related to Scharia, the University of Al-Ashar must be assigned, the most important islamic institution of the country with great radiation in the whole Sunnithic Islam.
This must not be, but it may mean that the church observes the legislation, which de facto would result in the rejecting of the Judicians.
In the draft of the processing, the interpretation is a matter
In addition, the civil military legality should continue to continue.
These courts served during Mubarak's Government to undermine oppositional.
After the street of the Dictator, up to 11.000 civilians were sitting in military.
The State also, it is in the draft, "the true way of the Egyptian family" is "and promotes their moral and their values".
This is legally so unfair that state institutions can even control the contents of film art and literature by means of this article.
It doesn't mean anything else than Zensur.
However, no article expressly states the equality of men and women.
For this reason, another prohibits the prophets Mohammed and his messengers to discipline or deny.
But what is an injury and how it is to be advised, it remains unexpected.
Similarly, dubios encourages the formulation that is prohibited by "protection of humans".
Is there already a career of the President or a guilty of the costs of a legal teacher?
Explainment, as much in the draft, the Mursi provides for signature and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for peoples' vote.
"The revolution is returned"
The opposition has been formed for weeks against the oversight of the Islamists.
Ten thousands gathered together in an inhabited income on Friday on the Tahrir place in Cairo and promised to take the Charta in place before it can enter into force.
"The revolution is returned and we will be blessed," said Hamdin Sabbahi, the third placer of the presidential elections.
Peacenobel prices and the ex chief of the International Atomic Energy, Mohamed El-Baradei, explained that the constitutional draft is "of the Mâberg of history".
By Twitter, he invited the advocate Mursis to lead a "Putsch against Democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we'll go to the palace and break it," said the Oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not still mocking that the blood of our brothers has not yet been lucky," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policyer Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum would not want to be monitored, so it would be wrong.
"The Coran is our constitution."
The well-organised muslim broadcast is on its side to the opposite demonstration, but not on the Tahrir place, but on the other nilufer before the Cairo University.
And the women and the guardians of the Salafists participated in it and cried, "The people ask the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi, "Working the land!" and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
A battle about the Majesty against the symbolic Tahrir place at which everything took its start, would have been a war of citizens.
That was obviously not a risk that Mursis attachers wanted to risk.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the enemies of the Constitutional draft and the Prosecutors would have expressed themselves and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the election time to go to the country.
A majority of the islamists' drafts is used as safe.
"The word of human rights doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is about this forced constitutional process, which would have gone until February and should include all social powers.
The 48-year human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended the muslim brothers when they were sitting in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are unpartial for him.
That's why he was tried, condemned, arrested.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he recalls in terms of "Welt on Sunday".
Mursi power extension on all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are ecological violations against democratic game rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictature.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the President set it de facto out of force," Saeda recalls.
However, without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels alone, including the international community, which considers the ideological direction camp on the Nil with a mixture of news and spending.
That could be enough.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns, "You are born a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rak fish from Norway: Is this the most evil fish in the world?
The five million people of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe, but in the whole world.
Could the country's successful secret have something to do with the local appetite on a pretty bad fish?
You are taking a choice of superregional boxes.
They're placed in the middle of a worst, flattered sport clothing.
And leave her there a week.
So unfortunately, you need to imagine the rack fish's nasen-proof, one of the great delicts of Norway.
I am in the small city of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, speculator landscapes - and this hard-nacked wind in the air that simply doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is stretched with salt forelles, which, depending on how stingling you would like his fish, is fermented up to a year in water.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather will be cold, Norwegians flow to a festival here in Fagernes, which now is actually determined to be very well-building speciality.
"Man eats it and then eats it with a glass acquavit down," says Havard Halvarsen, who is in the local firewagen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Along with us, people devote small fish wheels and take a large quantity of alcohol.
"Men love the aquavit more than the rak fish," says Havard.
The spiritose can disturb the voice.
I'm costing some hops.
If you avoid bringing the rack fish near the nasen, it's not bad - as well as Sushi, who has a very long bus travel.
Rak fish is the product of a whole other, weak Norwegian epoch when there were no cold opportunities and the fish was threatened in the herbst in air-deep waters.
In the deepest winter, he was taken out after long fermentation and - doubtless devoted to alcohol.
Before a generation, thousands of Norwegians looked forward to search for work to leave their country and were mostly invading in the United States.
Today, the population is quick - more than 13% are immigrants, located by a flowering work, high salaries and a global health.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was not long ago richer than Norway, streamed immigrants.
Rak fish is viewed as something important - as an essential, even though a strictly rich part of the Norwegian history.
He belongs to the courts you can buy here.
But there's all right here -- a little glass bird or a sandwich costs stolt 10 euros.
Norway does not often get it into the world pressure, and most people seem to don't like it.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - those racistic legal extremistes, who were killed last year 77 men, women and children.
Instead, you are only referring to the "found of 22 July".
Norwegians make it difficult to accept that someone in his peace-loving country is able to be so brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today's riches of Norway since the early 1970s is the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industrys in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why it is so good for us," says our cellner, which distributes round tablets with rafish, and with its long flowing hair and the blue eyes cover the northern idea.
We are one - as the people say - a sure people.
Your English is exactly as most people here makellos.
We're not very attractive, we don't like pleasure.
Norway has gone very carefully with the oil richty - a large part of the brain income is invested in a special fund.
In the years to the world economy crisis, all of them had a money that they had not seen, Norway kept his money bills closed.
"When we can walk in the winter Ski and turn in the summer, we're happy," says.
"And, of course, eat rack fish," they added with an unconscious smile.
I am standing in snow and putting me to another court -- I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such an Elch-Burger is something else in any case.
But on the evening the fish is back on the food plan.
The hotel in which I log in is one of several events that organize a rack-fish dinner at the guest for the best - or maybe the whistle can vote on the most exciting fish.
There is a live TV screening to a showmaster covered with FFEe, which is circulated by tellers with rak fish.
The speed is like Eurovision Song Contest.
"What number of points have you there up in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"There are our points, Havard."
You're crazy and laughing.
A man falls from chair, perhaps overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it's the hard darkness of the whole fish.
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto is before difficult start
As Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is prepared for his official access, Will Grant analyzes the challenges of the BBC and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently the vere in Mexico City is very bad.
Even in better days, this is a town always hidden, but on Monday a ring of steel was created, which was locked into the main city and cared on the streets for chaos.
However, the aim was not to switch pensioners on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching the Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the chairman's commitments and take the leadership of the nation.
He's before a complex task.
Under the separate Government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to economyly, but the country is in the capture of a war that has already held 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly involved in reducing violence," Pena Nieto explained the US President Barack Obama at the beginning of this week in Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy for which we can achieve this goal.
Before he went up with the US president, Pena Nieto was employed as Governor of his home country of Mexico.
In this nearby, the large-term part of the country around the capital city is divided by the views of the new government overseer.
A direct man
For example, in the delicate small city Valle del Bravo, you like to remember him.
The residents of the vacation site write to him the development of the tourism and the building of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the car rentals, allowed Pena Nieto to build and represent a great improvement towards the brushing, holprid roads that were once here.
Plackets with names also depend on outside a modern sport area and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and sustainable changes from him," as his friend and political associated Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who is a Congress Deputy for the Pena Nietos Party, the PRI.
With regard to security and economic, we hope for an interesting and real change that makes our country so swimming.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was solved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress Deputy Olvera states that the Party has a great expectation to Enrique Pena Nieto after 12 years outside the Chairman of Los Pinos.
The proposals of the opposition, which the new president has rejected, are rejected.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is a great Stateman, especially, but he is one who can listen.
But on the other hand of the State, many people do not share this view of their former Governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, including Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the roads of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under car transfers and is in a lot of views a president of Mexico City himself.
And the problems in the community are of determining urban nature.
In the beginning of this year, the military was enabled to combat the operating bands in the fourths, and violence against women is a particular acute problem.
On a flecken Brachland near a big deponie, the bodies of thousands of murdered women were left alone in the last two years.
During the Office of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State - a statistics that even overcome the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is charged for their violence and murder of innocent women.
The criticians Pena Nietos believe that he has not at least reached the problem of women's murder during his office.
However, in the worst case, his government has closed their eyes before the problem.
In a beton building, typically for the disappeared quarter, Irinea Buendia walks with the trees when she shows me photos of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events began to be killed by Mariana 2010.
But her family believes that she was killed by her lifefriend.
"When I came to her home, it seemed to be cut off her body," Senora Buendia reminds.
There were signs that she was shot, and the body stars had already been used.
As her mother told her story, she looks down from the wall a picture of Mariana on us. It is set near a cross that brings one word: justice.
But exactly this, like the family, has been disappointed by her until now.
The authorities have treated me, as if I were a wetch, an injury officer, a norgler.
They want to simply accept her judgment and keep her mouth.
"But this is not possible if there were so many forms of mistakes and mistakes," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the bindings of the President on Saturday, he will also take a great responsibility.
Ten thousand mexican families have been made in the last six years of violence crimes in compassion, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem especially during his official period.
"I hope he is as the President as a Governor," says Prime Congress Deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza feared most of them.
The State advocate claimed: Bradley Manning has not committed an error.
The State advocate resists Bradley Mannings' prejudices that he has been distracted in prison
The audience is in the military prison of Mannings in Quantico, Virginia
The defence stresses a derogation of the complaint on the basis of harder conviction conditions
The freedom of the US Army is provided for thousands of confidential documents
The State advocate tried on Friday to find that Bradley Manning, free of armies, was accused of the greatest enth-enth-release of confidential information of the US history - had distorted several opportunities to complain about the mistakes that he had been dealt with in military.
In a cross-review Mannings during a prompt audience in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained. Ashden Fein that documents of weekly visits, the prison officers had taken nearly nine months of prison in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-review, a request for defence was rejected - Manning was already punished by the hard-country time - had said Manning that he would have incarcered the Suizid in prison.
The US Army's Secret Service Analysis, arrested in June 2010, will be provided while he has stolen thousands of trusted documents in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never used Manning as a source of information.
In the meeting on Friday, Fein with Manning went through the formalists, after their meetings with Manning during his prison in Quantico Military prison, where he had placed in strengthened conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The employees asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him to the formulators on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and all the treatment by the establishment as "very professional".
The formalists, such a fine, had no complaints about misleading, although the employee Manning had directly asked for his treatment.
Maning replied that he had expressed his thoughts and the employees would have discussed them with him and indicated that they were not registered.
"You write (after the meeting of the thoughts) "No problems" and that doesn't mean necessary that I didn't say anything," so Manning.
The judge Denise Lind also asked Maning why he was not deceived of his treatment when he met a committee in January 2011, which should examine the thoughts of suicide that he had been given in a formula for a few months ago.
Maning replied that during this meeting, his view had been made to leave his observation status to "prevention of damage".
The military said that it had given him this restrictive status - which stands under self-mortal control - to ­ and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince the employees that it was good for me, and to release the observation status to prevent damage... to get a life quality from my view," Manning said.
Maning said on Thursday to his arrest and allocation to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before he was placed in prison in July 2010 in the Marine base of Quantico in Virginia.
He said he was in Kuwait and was inconscient once because of the hit.
Not to know what happened to him or in the outer world.
"My world shot on the camp Arafjon, on this kitchen together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this kitchen.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning has delivered the majority of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You have only allowed him a matrix, a cock, a floor, clothing, and his brilliant.
Maning said he was trying to stay moved because it was prohibited on the day to sleep or to just stand up.
Always he had to sleep with light, which is inside outside into his cell.
When he turned back night and wake up his face, he was raised to return.
In January 2011, Mannings advocate formally argued against the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Maning was held in the military prison by Fort Leaven日th, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked for an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he slept a night in his cell in Quantico and had to stand at a morning counting before guards and other prisoners.
Maning had said he never had the opportunity to run with his cocktail during this calculation.
At the question on Friday, Manning told that he had concluded from a command of his guard that he should have fallen the cover with which he could have covered. But he told that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he was forced to sleep in the last night. He had already tried to show a employee that he was not aware of himself.
Maning told the officer that he could have used the bond of his sub-hose or his flops to deceive himself, but it does not.
This night, maning said, his subhose, Flip-flops and Brille were removed from his cell.
His advocates hope that the judge will take into account at least his detentions and will be drasticly reduced by its detention, it should be condemned in his negotiation before the military court, which is used for the beginning of the next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning will be acknowledged for a lower offence, while other complaint points that are considered too extremely.
The consultation continues to be taken for this week, and the State advocate is expected to be justified by the debt conditions.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was maintained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all of the maximum security provisions in Quantico.
The complaints against Manning include the benefit of the enemy, the illegal publication of secret service information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the decree of public property or documents.
If he is found in all cases of accusation, he will cause him a long-life penalty.
My mexican-American activity crisis.
People have been forced to leave Mexico because of the failing opportunities
Mexican people tend to accuse the migrants - they call them hard time in memory, he says
Navarrette is the view that mexican Americans have been captured between two worlds
On a recent journey to Mexico City, I just had passed through the hall and was at the passenger control when advicelessness made me wide.
Schilder referenced to two waiting slanges: one for "Mexico" (Mex—Mex—) and another for "Extranjeros" ("Externals").
I was there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should be.
I was raised in Central Califórnia and my whole life was called "Mex".
A ethnic shortcut - just as my friends are called in Boston "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I disappeared for "Mexican-Americ".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shortcuts or sticks.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to consider me in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I am not available to the vocabulary of a mother speaker, and I'm not going to leave my chairman.
So I took my traveling pass and put me into the shadows for extranjeros.
I thought about the moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda, all the subjects that are expected when the heads of these two countries are met: immigration, and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in speaking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for mexican people today to stay with the same high probability in Mexico, instead of migrating into the United States.
He wants to join with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block as an example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swears to continue the Mexico war against the cards, even though he did not call any details about it.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of residence.
Most Americans probably never dismiss one thought that the United States included in Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership to leave them more than the help of their territory.
But for Mexico who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be reviewed.
So once a US government officer exercises only the milest criticism in Mexico, you can hear - in the Mexico press and among the elite of the country - demand how the Americans deteriorate the sovereignty of their neighborhood.
And the children of Montezumas are walking on the war path.
However, the greatest challenge of Mexico is true in relation to more than 35 million Mexico Americans living in the United States.
Did you like to talk about resentiments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers chances, and others who do not do this.
The only reason why so many people lived in Mexico origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our stam tree a person - maybe a parent or larger - had no chance offered in Mexico and migrated in north.
And in most cases, this person expressed a profile - dark, unfair, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these men, and our loyalty applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the dream, visit schools and receive jobs, we can never lose from the eyes that it is the dream we live - not the Mexico.
Our efficiency is sometimes possible, but what our loyalty refers to is not the case.
This applies clearly to the United States.
Moreover, we are conscious that many members of the Mexico leadership do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
You see us as a madmale of a humiliating downstairs and look at us down because we are not mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough to our bands to Mexico never be strong enough.
Your opinion is that our existence is a symbol of the sheet.
If our families weren't wrong in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not see us captured behind the seat of the seat, with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who was immigrated legally to the United States, reminds me that there are spending between Mexico and Mexico Americans, because Mexico have a clearer idea of who they are - and mexican Americans take this wrong to them.
Since she is a US State citizen, she seems to be part of two countries.
But many mexican Americans, I know, have the feeling that they do not belong to one or another country.
We love the mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
You're enjoying the best of both worlds, but it's not in any of them.
In Mexico, we'll be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we will be viewed as Mexico.
As I should learn during my travel, there is something that makes this relationship more complicated: some mexican leaders and parts of educational citizens want to take their connections to diaspora again.
They want mexican Americans to use as temporary "boots" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our colleagues how beautiful this country is and pressure on the political lead to intensify their commitments to Mexico.
Well.
This will not be done.
Too many harmful feelings.
And because of the unrighteous income distribution, the unfair corruption and the governance, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a good country.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to go over there alone, Amigos.
That's right.
If at least some Mexico people are not ready to forgive the United States for Mexico for trafficking with other half centuries ago, they also need to accept that some Mexico Americans have a role for their family members as long as they have been treated.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "mexican" as I thought.
Old Wars, New Near East
The state of weapons between Israel and the Hamas could be demonstrated as unexpected basic arrows for peace
Can there ever be a standing peace between Arabs and Jews in the Near East?
The latest bloody events seem to have such a hope in keim.
In the midst of the usual faults, there were many insane buildings in shoutt and ashe, more than 140 Palestinians who were most of these citizens, and six of them killed Israeli - and for the first time rackets from Gaza were placed near the Israeli Metropole Tel Aë and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelites and Palestinians seem to be captive in their historical conflict, the Near East changes around them.
The Arabic conference has created a new, unconscious situation, and whether they want or not - Palestinians and Israelites have become part of these animals.
Maybe this will only lead to more blood losses.
However, there are reasons to assume that the death pattsituation could finally find its end.
A war that will not be lost or won't be won
At the first corner, optimism seems to be made other than the current situation.
Even if the weapons stand holding on 21 November, these weekly fights have strengthened the hard-society on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the islamist movement, which has been controlled by the Gaza Streams since 2007, is assumed that the Israelites have revoked, although its own grouping had to cause great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders were killed and the 1,7 million inhabitants of the Gaza stream were killed in one of the most desolate and closely populated corners of the planet, Israel was not able to destroy the Hamas until now.
In fact, the Hamas in West-Jordan has been won, which is controlled by the rivalising, consistent Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, the Hamas can take strong and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a rearranging, regional power, which at the same time became the first muslimian associates of Israel, has taken place for the Hamas Party - just as Katar, one of the richest and dynamic golf states.
Jubelended Hamas attachers believe that Israel is a islamist halfman - from Libanon in the north, where the military Hisbollah has the power, overwhelmed where rebels of a very islamist prejudice could stand before the destruction of Bashar Assads, until Jordan, where Hamas associates drowned the king.
In particular, the growth of the muslim broadcasting among President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the most strong and most important Arab country, in the southern flame of Israel, has sustained the equality of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laidist Despot, who ruled Egypt up to Sturz 2011 for 30 years, had only a little time left for the Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood is distorted with the Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on people views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could be demonstrated as an actor that cannot be exhausted by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hard liners leave a dismissed conclusion.
Militaryly seen the Hamas is no more.
The Israeli raketen disorder system, "Iron Dome", has been able to settle, and many of the hamas rackets have been decreased.
At least a while, Israel will be able to sleep more silently.
In diplomatic view, the United States are unfair to their position.
Israel has succeeded in the past years, especially among the Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to large parts.
Although rackets from the Gaza streams have killed about 30 Israelites since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of self-mortality - not lately thanks to the sphere plans that have gone into the main part of any Palestinian state, but these are the Jewish centers, which have been explained for national law, continue to be built.
Netanyahu is well there. His Likud party joined himself in the case of elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with a more conflicting group.
Why do these Palestinians also dismiss and leave their own state?
If they actually had the control over the Western country, would they not be just as their partners in the Gaza stream would also take rackets?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them, they should take the heads.
Perhaps the hardlines will be able to take place, but the arabic freshness could make them a strike through the account.
Even if the Islamists who are now in Egypt and in other countries have a little left for Israel, they will be able to cope with the difficulties in their own country.
The defence statute of Israel is greater than his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to establish their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi is together with Barack Obama in order to achieve a weapon state, it might be a promised sign - and may symbolize the beginning of a new era.
The Israelites should also think longer.
As the rest of the Arab world takes steps towards democracy, the Palestinians continue to explode their self-determination rights - a pulmonary phase that will certainly explode in the Israeli occupied areas, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel A.
The pressure has already been undermined by the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arabian population, this situation will only be increased.
Blood missions to recover the Hamas in Gaza's streets will be requested for the years almost by their diplomatic tribut.
Both pages need an end of outside
The right answer is those who represent the most reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and of this magazine: two states in which Israel is insurance areas.
The - for the near future - hope is that weapons standing will give more influence to the implementation of this solution.
Egypt now has to stop the weapons in the Gaza streams together with Turkey and Katar and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas from the idea of a Jewish State on the basis of the borders of 1967, added by the area exchange and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab N ́s should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have been made more for the creation of a Palestinian State than for the previous request for UN observator status.
Obama also needs to move his part in moving Israel to negotiations.
In his first official period, he dismissed the view of his own peace plan.
It seems to be remote in the white house that he would also have rejected a share.
But this is a sustainable, short-sighting perspective.
The United States have a significant interest in a steady near East.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In force, the laws for single cycle packages shall enter into force
health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packages equal to all tobacco marks
The first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packages worldwide have entered into force, so that mark logos and colours are replaced by neutral, olive green deckles, which are printed by drastic images which are the cross parts of the body and the kidneys and the kids who are infected by cigarette smoke.
From the various health warnings and pictures once, it is from the next Saturday of the only subsection between the packages in the mark names that are printed in identical, small scripts.
In this context, the worldwide strongest regulations for tabac packages are introduced.
The Australian Federal Government wants youths to take away from the smoke by eliminating the glamous image of the tobacco consumption.
This is the government that has shown that people who have not yet started with 26 will not be started with 99% of the probability.
"You can see in children of young age that they understand the message to ask the tobacco concerns with their marking image," thus Tanya Plibersek, Federal Health Ministry. They cited, for example, that children have shown that they associate the crown of a logos with the idea of a princess.
Although one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world and the changes will only be lowly affected on the winning of the multinational concerns, other countries already have similar steps.
The tabaklobby struggled hard against the laws.
This was the case that the black trade would benefit from the laws, which would lead to billiger and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, undesirable consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco.
Chinese and Indonesian falses will be offered much greater quantities of these products on the roads.
Others say that the laws have covered their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family enterprise, notes that the request for Zigarettenetuis and silicone boxes to cover the inevitable packages have been enormous since the British American Tobacco Conzernes, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco were divided two months ago at the highest Australian Court Chair of Justice.
Zico has increased up to 6.000 units for big businesses and waited for new stocks.
This is a business for us.
Experts, accordingly, are the hakens in the ability of social media in exactly the population group to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws has broken tobacco counters out of the TV, it underscores them to appear as sports pointers and forced the majority of the employees to not put cigarettes in business anymore. Now the tobacco requirement is changed to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited Internet communication by local enterprises and pages, but there is no influence on international sides.
"Who makes Tabak and has only left a small area to require his products does not come to the Internet," says Becky Freeman, health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports to marks that were noted by "normal people".
You need to ask yourself, is it just a person who finds such a great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that it takes even a video - or has a marking agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco a stated that the industry was located on Marketing on it, and that it was possible to deal with the new laws.
It has even been so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new rules - those countries are charged by the World Trade Organization on unrighteous trade restrictions, although there is no greater trade in the countries.
A WTO decision is expected for the middle 2013.
According to Plibersek, the Government has conducted negotiations with other countries which have added similar package laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001, which predicted photo warnings.
In the meantime, they were extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Greece, New Zealand, South Africa and India, the stronger laws are established.
Australian fucking fuckers are proud.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You're just taking a shot and putting the box away," Victor El Hage says when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the Tabak Trade "King of the Pack" in the inner city of Sydney, says that the unified package has caused the fulfillment of his rules.
"Before I needed an hour to arrange a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The Government should simply prohibit cigarettes completely - then we would have told us well, that's what we're doing close," he obviously invited.
In a constantly electricized world, it's beautiful to be even a long-term
This thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours in the aircraft when our aircraft was running due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another fungser.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts about long-term times.
I don't want to lie.
A half day at the airport to wait for a flight is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones are available (and, of course, free shopping).
But more academics and child development experts are long-life than something positive.
If it follows them, it's for us - and our children - all right, sometimes lowly.
This forces the brain to lose in interesting ways of thinking, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly looking on one or other screen, the benefits of the long-term time will not benefit us anymore.
So should we welcome the long time with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll be back on that again.
As many people, I have always seen that Longeway is a relatively current phenomenon, which has developed with a late time of freedom.
But Peter Toohey, Professor for Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale日 Press, 2011) does not see that.
"In fact, the long time has a very long story," he says.
The Pompeji's home walls draw a Latin Graffiti over the longway, which returns to the first century.
And then there's still the question how we define long-life.
According to John D. Eastwood, a associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada is the problem of definition and discussion of long-life in many kinds.
After long literature of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a group of focuses of approximately 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that long-life as the experience is to be defined "a pleasant activity, but it is not possible".
Lately, it distinguishes from Apathy, therefore, that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
At the Apathie, there's no force to do something.
The key performance of the long time, he says, is in a "shopping of the attention process, parsed with bad launch and feeling that the time is just slow."
Lately, it can be almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two situations could be related, the depressive people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are long-term, even though we have only difficulties to be able to handle.
In their area "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to Germany about: "The inactive understanding: the definition of longeway under the aspect of the attention", which occurs in September in the period "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues show a previous experiment, listening to the participant of a band on which a person reads a magazine article.
Some groups heard a sound television program from the neighborhood room that had nothing to do with the content, and others listened to low volumes, so it was unapproval, while the group did not understand this sound.
The people who understood the lack of hearing television suggested to discover more longer than the two other groups - they had problems to concurre, they could not find for this reason and wrote their difficulties of the long-term.
If you are trying to cope with a difficult or stressing task, it can lead attention to a long time, Mark J. Fenske, associated professor for Neurological Sciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the Property.
If you go to a single activity - "as looking for bad products on a factory-foresting band, you can refuse music and help not feel aware."
In fact, he says, we now know that herums and crissels, often interpreted as signs for long-term times, can even be struggled by persons being more careful.
"Studies have shown that children who can have a hole can learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down," says Professor Fenske.
We all are going to be long-term - my late flight, a thirsty speaker, a particularly encouraged movie.
But some people are longer easier than others.
To measure these subsequents, researchers developed a "scale for long-term events" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "Multiple things I have to do, repeat and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With such scales, researchers have discovered that boys will be more longer than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor for Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially what concerns the need for more and a greater employment of external resources.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty relaxed crop.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment where he contacted a pager seven to eight times a day.
He discovered that 32% of the adults in the school and in the performance of the household, however, 23% indicated to be low if they were not at school.
However, only 3% of the parents began to feel quietly.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the parts of the procurement have been broken or seized in relation to the long-term.
However, he is sure that "the youth will be found especially long-term," mainly because children and teenagers have no great influence on their everyday course.
So back to my original question: Is Langeway healthy?
Sometimes it does not, because in extreme case, it leads to that people take extremely physical risks on themselves and take the game of happiness or ability to linch them - that has shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between long and creativeness. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who investigated the subject for more than two years.
"In the long time the brain wants to tell one that you should do something else," thus Gary Marcus, Professor for Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what you should do.
If a long-term and use this energy to play and cook gitarrs, you will be happy.
However, although television can take care of happiness in short terms, they will replace long-termly.
Whoever has a long-term child, so, can take it from the long-term time, but it has not learned to interview or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he added: "The self-control is transferred from one situation to the others."
The child learns not only to interview, but also gets more self - control in other areas.
I don't think we should zelebrize longeways.
We should not even see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should also be to feel us unless we have continuous Action and Technology implementation.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be more longer, but long-term is the challenging, incomplete desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are in truth only looking for a way, disabled and relaxed.
"In a surrounding environment, we are always overstimated, it seems difficult to work when the warm is understood."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marihuana legality
The 19-year Community College Student and Football Player Anthony Orozco is in South East Colorados for a proceeding before the court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some less marihuana broke and a roof with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were arrested.
After the police officer Marihuana found in the car, Orozco was forwarded for the possession of ­ and ­utensilies - cavaliers delegates, each of which were offended with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court.
"We're being treated as criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the undesirable weeks following the decision of the State to legalize small quantities of Marihuana for their own use, the response depends less on the law than on the place.
Hundreds of injuries that turn about Marihuana are already allowed here and in Washington, who approved similar measures.
The police members have no longer followed adults over 21 years of age for small possession. This is legally placed as the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But state advocates in the conservative areas of Colorados have announced to continue to follow existing Marihuana delegates and still cite people before the court.
At the same time, several cities are voted to prevent new, stately licensed Marihuana businesses in their communities from the predestinated Denvers to the Western Mountains.
"This situation is so quickly developing that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, a police officer in Aurora, who is wedding from Denver.
And also regulatory auditors in the Federal State of Washington are unconscious to the head.
They expect an orientation assistance to establish a license system for production, production, production and sale of drugs and have a time limit until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, there is a view that Colorado is in any case before the majority of the states as regards the regulation of Marihuana, where the drug was legalized to medical purposes and then to its own consumption.
"Colorado has a stronger regulated market, so the State is well guided," says Brian E.
But it also indicates that no place or system can be done more than to serve in the sense of a great leadership.
"We have no real presidential case that we can follow," he added.
The Washington Law, named I-502, enters into force on 6 December and also forms the end of a green zone where the State license system is not yet existing, but the property is legalized.
And inappropriate practical issues must be claimed at this time - such as the State standard of a "measured access" to a licensed Marihuana with the prohibition of cannabis business around 300 meters to schools, parkings, games and child management facilities.
"Nowhere will be more difficult to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in cities, especially in Seattle's balling area," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently built research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his employees to Aurora a mail, in which he explained that the State advocate would not follow more marihuana delegates in persons over 21 years, and that the police would not try straining for these crimes.
Boss Oates suggests that the police will continue to implement local rules for the regulation of medical marihuana producers and to continue to follow trade operators.
In Weld County in North Colorados, the Ombudsman Ken Buck has a stronger view.
After voting, he announced that his authority would continue to follow cases of Marihuana's ownership, mainly to move consumers to discharge.
Currently 119 persons must be responsible for the possession of approximately 50 grams or less Marihuana, although many have been accused of other delictes.
"Our authority has the obligation to pursue crimes in which it was actually committed to criminal offences," Buck forsook in a claim.
The reactions are conscious in places such as Mesa County, where electors refused the Marihuana initiatives.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the country circle, shows no longer the growth for the possession of smaller quantities.
Mr Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but it also decided to lay down non-existing procedures.
"I don't think I'm going to lose my time to implement the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the electors in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to agree with the complexities of the Government and legal system.
And the opposite reactions throughout the country promoted a deeply deeply-speaking table among local officers in respect of the great green experiment at day.
It is a "cultural bar", says Sean McAllister, a jury lawyer of Denver, who commits a complaint for Marihuana delegates before the court and acts as speakers for the National Organization on the Reform of Marihuana.
"You have given such a large part of their life to persecute persons criminally that they are still not able to accept legalization," he believes.
As the first states that treat the smaller quantities of Marihuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national patterns for legitimization of Property.
In the same time, monetary prosecutors and public officers are prepared for a period of legal sale, they also expect to be nervous for the instructions of the Federal Government, which will continue to treat the sale and building of Marihuana at the federal level as a penalty.
Preachers of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be given.
Despite several observable arrests of consumers and sellers of Medical Marihuanas, the Federal Government has placed the sale of Medical Marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former politicians of the Government of Obama, believes that although criminal officers are probably not to enter into the doors to take a smaller quantity of them, they will be promptly struggled with legal, publicly regulated Marihuana business under the new legislation.
Many towns in Colorado are not expected to act.
Before the election day, some local community administrators authorized Moratories for new Marihuana works, though they could open only in about one year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month prohibition, which probably will be overcome next week.
"We don't want to go into a position in which we license someone and then stand on a federal level before a big problem," says Bob Nicholson, member of the city Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment to the law.
We will then judge what the congregation has decided and not what the State has decided.
There are still many questions open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was moving from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It was always my greatest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
As my father and my older brother had visited the university that I only thought for the greatest attitude of the world, for a modern Greek symposium that encouraged the large columns of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my income in the Worscester College end of the eighteen years - I had been able to study history - I had packed my coffee again and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father's together in trees.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it said I would have gone because I had a problem with getha-- that comilytons had sex in the neighborhood room.
The author A N Wilson explained scholarly that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from protected bags.
But the truth was less amazing.
I went away.
Yeah, it went because I've been under systematic mobbing and dressing.
Not at least because of my very unusual name, or because I came from a school.
I had only been schikaned for one reason - a reason in this famous point of light appeared to be so amazing and grassing: my middle dead father Woodrow Wyatt was a major adviser Margaret Thatchers, and I used to serve the Conservative Party.
Why do I know this right now?
Now, the current reports suggest a new generation of students of the rights corresponding under similar persecution.
The organized and growing hate on Tory Students in Oxford has developed in the middle of such dimensions that a group of them last week requested the same equivalent protection to benefit the swimming, barriers and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they are "oft actively isolated, personally attacked and explained for unnecessary".
They request a place in their college equivalent rights commit to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Its situation was deteriorated by a recent documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the right", which the Tories represented as exemplary and neonazis.
It was shown, among other things, of Abërt Joe Cooke, the former president of the conservative student unit of the University of Oxford, who was running in a Royce, and with silver colored and silver-build greenhouse.
Conservative students say to other universities, they are considered as "Feedbooks for the introduction of practices".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, forbidden in a Sunday magazine: "There is a growing links tender at universities.
People believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without telling us all about."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historical student in Corpus Christ, who initiated the cluster for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "inappropriate." The 19-year Stephanie Cherill, designed by the President of Oxford's Conservative Student Association, has observed a growing decline to students of the rights.
"This is a > for the intellectual discourse and the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredible 18 years old, I came in September 1986.
The hate on the conservative party had reached its height point.
In the previous year, the university had voted for Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of shortages in high school.
The atmosphere would even scare stalinists.
In the first days of the first Week, in the new students and the Tutors, I received a prejudice to the future events.
I made the experience that the Tutors did not only dul the disturbance of Tory students but even participated with joy.
Political subjects such as the mountain workshop, the Implementation and the delay of the Government of Sanctions against the South African Apartheid Regime found their way to the wooden areas of Tutori.
In my first events, I should have translated French texts from the 18th century to English.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt, "report the first paragraph."
I was crazy with it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a kitchen, and pretty disgusting.
"Don't Thatcher attachers learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kissed.
In my eyes, the trees were wounded up.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your free time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt touched me.
I went back to my room with a deep head.
On this evening, I was alone at the college at the evening when someone was easily pointing me on the cups.
It was a English student of the second year named James, who represented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's like it is.
Everyone who is deceived to be Tory will be triggered.
It's already bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is near, so it'll be worse for you.
The most Tory First Emergency suggests to be attachers of the Labor party.
In a local pub, I tried later to imagine.
I said I was not at all points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should be unsuccessful.
A launcher in the philosophy, and economic, who ironicly visited it as conservative Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist wine."
You're disappointed.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was crazy and crazy.
"How do Tories have sex?" asked me one.
They're shaking each other, isn't it?
I felt like homosexual before the liberal law of the United States.
Would I ever like to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to find similar thoughts only after the brush of darkness?
Should I apply the Labor party and press my natural neighborhoods?
The three years that stood before me were declined before my spiritual eye to a feet of lust and isolation.
The only Tutor, who was to recognize himself openly as Tory, was Norman Stone, Professor for modern genetic history, who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative but also because he consulted Thatcher in matters of foreign policy and had written talks for them.
He was just rare there.
He hated the place, found it provincially and smallly cured and rejected him for his marxist-determinist history speech.
1997 he adopted a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started pioneering between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge in closed friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why did I do it.
He seemed unbelievable.
Within his time in the Fourteenths, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said little.
That's what they'd never do, not shoot in my town of dreaming tours.
Even my communist friends always put free maniers on the day.
His foolish eyes were twisted.
Give the whole one a chance.
I'm sure you're just getting tired.
It would break my heart if you went.
Increased by my often traveling to London, my emotional opposite became weaker.
One of my men's friends, too Tory attachers, had followed the pressure and refused his convictions.
In the next week in which another historian student had severely said that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Though I had a secret to shame, I admitted that my parents had me under a "hearing wheel" and called her "ancient trottel".
The easier was only a short time.
It was my father who shot the last nagel in my Oxford Care Sarg.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch price.
My door was closed.
I hided me in my room, and after five minutes, my boys got up.
When they went, I packed a coffee and took the first move to London.
I never came back.
You're pleased to call me a weird dream.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer in a educational facility under such an insultation and illness.
And more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university which has not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers but hided up to this day after an unworthy call of equality and thought freedom.
"Valentino provides elegancy of famousness"
According to the "Valentino - Master of the Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC says with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian composer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British main city, which is worth the residence of an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This has recognized the designer in the designing of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a great retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture were compiled by "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with an inconvertable Italian ac.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il gentlemen" Garavani, but who could not be written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always spent fascination for the sticking and remote world of the adel.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be seen until the 3th March, there is a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most reading aristocracy, started by princess Salimah Aga Khan, over Prince Marie Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal reminders as a trophe of his social growth from the famous masker in Voghera in North Italy to the Idol of the International Jetsets.
To be lost in the adel, it must not be deceived.
"They're at least not going out their knifes on your glorious teppich, as it's doing some beautiful experiences from the popmusic," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, both lived in the alpes and were friends.
Valentino is a speech-cultural, magnifying and elegant guest.
"We all are happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-law of "Heini" Thyssen, friendly with forgotten beauty such as Marella Ag日i or Eugeni Niarchos.
Valentino has always done the elegancy of the famousness.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a clothe of Valentino
Moreover, the argentin model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charism of the master.
A lot of years ago, we went to him to the house at Piazza di Spagna in Rome to the evening.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Any detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music was recognized and seemed to be influenced.
"All invitations felt important and gelous," reminds the "Top-Modell", which started their travel at the week of the Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of the face, because his designs are artworks," she finally says..
Source Mode View
The life of Garavani is not a story of disappointment, rather of mutual love.
He loves people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the gallerys in Somerset House was converted into a glorious and 60 metres long course, which proposes a role exchange: the user takes the location of the model and goes to the course to wonder a dreaming "audience" that carries the master works of Valentino, for example, the clothes that Jackie Kennedy chose for his holiday with Aristoteles Onassis, the costs that Monica Vitti took in "La Note", or a mantel of wall and leder, which belonged to the Caiser Farah Diba.
In this public, the names of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the macker, 2006
Say these artists, the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a hose, a hammer, a west type "Gilette" and a jack from the Herbst/Winter Collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," Naty Abascal said, one of the Museums of the Designer.
"I take him all of the others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our splendidness, fore," fÃ¦ add the ex herogin of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very; they have much light and understood the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and leader of opinion at Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she traveled a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to have one of his little evening...
The end of the 90s then came to it.
I bought my first Valentino clothes for a festival in my grandfather's clothes, Prince Edouard de Line.
It was a red clothing with a flying rock and a drapped surface with a decollete that makes name honor.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino doesn't depend on the hold, his possession is untimely," states this Italian aristocratin, which is between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires le.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her nightmare of the Maker's "with absolute concern" because a clothing is not only a clothes but also the memories associated with it.
The "King" of the
The great end of the exhibition in Somerset House is the clothing of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Raga" (as the master called his neighborhoods) were necessary to offer this 11-colored seed clothing with perles, 12 different stickers and a 4-5 meter long weight.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the main authority of the Fachpresse, this clothing was a milenstein in the Haute Couture end of the 20th century, "the back to the artists of the highest society".
For years with the "savoir-ster" of the Elite, Valentino is now its best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest exhibition of the Italian), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Letters, issued with the honest legion, cumulated Garavani so many honors as each of the husbands of his artists.
"My is always his refinement, his rest, his embraced and perfect outside," D'Arenberg admits.
I've seen him last time a month ago at a gala dinner in the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting on the table of Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was makellos; the time left no tracks on him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult work in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian Vulcan will put their lives and their health on the game if they have 70 kilo weights over the steel, stone ways.
There are people for whom their work is the Hהee, and others work hardly in the HÃ©e.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 min workers who deserve their lives by taking weapons from the Vulkan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To this, he must go down every day on the ground of his crater, where the streaming gas flows out of the earth in contact with the air.
After he broke out big swimming stones that can weigh up to 70 kilo, he transports them into two bathroom bottles on his walls over the rocky roads of stone.
Although there are only 250 metres to the top of the Vulcan, which rises up to a height of 2386 metres, the created trainers need more than 40 minutes for the growth in the sword cream, while they must keep the equivalent and keep their steps carefully so that they do not exhaust and exhaust.
You know that every step can cost their lives, as this has made a French tourist, which has been cut off at the cawah Ien pigs ago.
Kawah Ien's mine workers deserve 5 Eurocents for each kilo weapons they deserve.
On the top, they bow up the way between the tourists who photographed them as circusaffen and running with the humblely hard corners three miles up to the waage, which a mine company has set a little more down at a height of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the events in Vulkan since 1960 and (not better said) of his workers who pay 662 Indonesian Rupies (5 Eurocent) for each kilo swivel.
This will then rebuild for each 100,000 Rupias (83 Eurocents) to the petrochemical industry because this mineral is spread every day and is used for the manufacture of strikehouse, firework articles, cosmetics, dynamics and even for sugar bleeding.
"When we usually get 70 kg, we get about 46.000 Rupias (3.8 euros) for every way," Anto, which normally makes three pieces a day.
For each part, he needs three hours, which he has been completely created, but then he has 138.000 Rupias (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
What seems to be a miserable loan for such a little unmanual effort, but the threefold of what he would deserve with the field work.
"The daily payment of the min workers here, where 15,000 Rupias (1,2 euros) are paid on the day, and the average monthly income of two million Rupias (167 euros) is very high," states the trainer who is previously murdered on the Bali Island.
There he deserved 75.000 Rupias (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and it is because of a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sweet: "I have married a girl from Bali where they are hinduists, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has astma, breathed with difficulty, hot often, and his eyes are rotated because of the toxic gas.
The 27-year Anto puts his life in Kawah Ijen on the game, whose weef has already left the first tracks, although he covers his face with a mask and special brilliant.
Anto has astma, breathed with difficulty, hot often, and his eyes are rotated because of the toxic gas from the Vulcan.
This is the price he must pay for his dream.
"I'll work here for two years because I want to open a load or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more acceptable English.
This sympathic and intellectual, but a young man punished from life could work as a tourist leader, Kellner, or to receive a hotel, but instead he makes the work of a tragedy.
He divides a shadow tree with other trainers and stands up every morning at two hours, because the weapon also stretches night, where his characteristic iron color is clearly clear in the darkness.
In the light of a small star lamp on `Helm, which he has covered by his own money, in the craters.
At the bottom of the craters, 400 travelers are loading the corbs with weapons on their walls.
Despite their large wins, the mine company has not mechanized the weight-building to save costs, and provides to the trainers who work on their own accounts and are paid by weight no equipment.
You do not have any share in the 300,000 Rupias (2.5 euros) awards per camera, which the guards of this natural park require with the income payment of 15.000 Rupias (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come to photograph the Vulcan and the human tragedy.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protests Madrizin, a fair 42-year old trainer, who has been three years since the school left in Kawah Ijen.
He is able to get up to 110 kg and assure that he continues "as long as it goes", because he takes the money for his three children in the age of 10 to 18 years.
I'm not gonna go to the trains, I'll die here because the Vulcan was my whole life.
Even if the wheel burns the steel and the eyes jump when the wind turns suddenly and the mine workers in the deep columns that rise up from the crater, the men are so hard that no one is committed to serious diseases ... of course, except the usual spirit problems, arthrose, pain in the knees and blass on the waves of the corbs.
With the corb on → Back, Oneinic is only in the ability to 50 kg with its 53 years.
Each day he and his friends break 15 tonnes of weapons from the Vulkan, transported by three LKWs over a trail between the ship to the camp in Tamansari in 18 miles remote.
"I'm not going to rounds, I'll die here because the Vulkan was my whole life," explains Uninic, where he opens his mouth far, in which some teeth fell.
From his five children, the elders with his 30 years also as weapons.
The time is lost, but the armshot holds generation on generation in one of the most hard works of the world: those who work as human lastesel in Kawah Ijen.
Singapore brought babies to salvation of the economy
The Singapores make the fault that they do not have children, on the kare, stress, and the costs of immobility and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfil our citizen's obligation and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising for Minzbons, but, however, or just because, they have been in Singapore at the beginning of this year to a viral video on YouTube.
The seats are part of a rapper song, the local language such as "Shoeben" will be a "bao" (laib) in the ovens to make it fun over the lower birth rates in Singapore.
The advertising BBH, which has dressed the video, is the hope that the advertising is in a pleasant way to take attention to the problem.
Your creative leader Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their "national obligation".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the greatest problem in this country.
We are the worst of the world, so we noticed that it was a subject that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government tried many things, such as the confusion of parfums with phermones or the organization of Speed Dating Events (fast flourts).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not force to succeed.
So we thought, why don't we do something so creative as possible to cope with this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Who doesn't easily take this topic is the Government of Singapore.
Each year, it provides $1.300 for political measures to prepare the citizens to get more children.
A package of the Government for husbands and parents is granted up to 15.000% per child, extends the maternal licence and distributes tax advantages.
But everything had little success until now.
Singapore is a rich, high-scale city country in South East Asia, which is also for the conservation of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to his national population, the birth rates are currently 1,2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate was over 2 - which is also as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapores get children anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the Country and Family Policy of the National People's Parties, says that this is to refer to a "better education" and "creasing charity skills".
"This has enabled people to marry outside the marriage and to make a family essentially more options in relation to life objectives and priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social cases have been added to the number of individuals and to the submarines of marriage and births, which are the reduction of birth rates in Singapore.
A migration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigrants in order to respond to the reduction of the population to resentiments in the local population.
In Singapore, there are web pages where the nearly cached xenophobie bleeds against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized to keep the sales low and do not integrate themselves.
The increase in immigration will also be considered one of the reasons that the Governing Party in Singapore has achieved its worst choice results since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with advanced contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
Singapore also shows unexpected effects when the falling birth rates affect the economic growth of a nation, tax income, health costs and immigration policy.
The Government is trying to find that not so many small apartments are built.
This is what she has already affected the apartment.
The State Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments that are "shooters" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a residence of 46 square metres and show a great selling success.
However, there is anxiety that they can promote the lifestyle of the only person, and that they fear the buildings of building a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Immobiliary Firm EL 日ers, says that his "shooting shoes" are far more faster than larger living units.
They're so eirable, and the units are faster in days and even weeks than the largest living units.
This leads to that they are much better for our Cash Flood.
However, it indicates that the new standards provide clearer orientations to developers, which have already been placed in the way of building too many small living units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way to increase the national birth rates, the talk with the Singapores working in the financial quarter is to assume that they will not have a great effect.
"The people are strongly disappointed, the apartments and the education are also closer, therefore it is exhausted from many," says a young manager.
Children can get others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time" says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead to their care, stress and costs for property and education as a reason why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singapores have the last word when they are about to get children - that the government can do so much.
The offline section offline is online private
Equal
According to the Dictionary, it is the property of the privacy or "the area of life, where protecting from any kind of mixture".
What is private for someone under 16 years?
How is this definition applied to its entire day and social networks?
Does he understand what he's exciting if he makes in the Internet situations that he wouldn't share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five youths between 10 and 15 years of age that are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term with " something very own" at personal level and "to the password and user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't give in a post" says the 10-year-old Jorge at trying to explain the importance of "privat" in web pages such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has passed over accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he asserts.
On FB I load beautiful images or images of games.
I'm also spending my time with people.
"I wouldn't share a photo that is not of me, or of someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is clearly clear that it is wrong to write overwhelming photos, of nakten, to public crimes, or reasonable or violent comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I joined Twitter to express me and write interesting Twitters.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I'm just laying them up" he adds.
"The social networks are amazing, I can quickly talk to friends in the remote or friends," he says.
He asked that he would never accept an invitation of an unknown.
Even if someone accepts him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he allows 20 of the people he has called his friend list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, for example music," he says.
According to the indication of the boy, no one has made him an adjunction or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If anyone disturbs me or asks me, I'll just remove him from my user account," he gives it.
José logged in Ask after he had given a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy's experiences are not known today as Cyberbullying.
The known friend of a friend was pressed in a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
"He never knows who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He's just made it private."
Then he makes a number of steps to configure a user account safe.
In the subsheed to Jorge, this boy pictures of known persons would be uploaded in inconsistent or penalty situations.
Yeah, I would do that if he's unsipatical to me, or I'd like to throw him out.
"But I know this is Cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with high school conclusions in education and learning, believes that to orientate children and youths, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to be informed.
"The Internet appeared as a media for search for information; with the appearance of these pages, the game rules have changed," she says.
Porras states that the Academic Marc Prensky, the inherent of a master title in phedagogic at the Yale University and the author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms for the opening of the Phenom.
The Digital Natives are they, children and youths who have been raised with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it's a complex topic, "for we want them to have a definite criteria about what broadcasting, publishing or saying, and this in an age where the ride is not sufficient."
"They must also be choiceful if they are the most important to be able to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," he said.
According to the expert, it is the most effective way to teach children and youths what is the opportunity to ask them questions that it brings to think.
"To say that they don't do it, it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why then do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like it if you publish a photo of you, like what you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the others for authorization before when you labeled photos of holidays?
And another question: should everyone know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"A man outside the Internet acts with respect, stability and other principles, and the same must apply for social networks," he explains.
Monitor
Estuardo Guardia, University Professor, Basic Schooler and Educational Advisers, comments that it is impossible that parents carefully read the directives of social networks.
If they understand all sections, they have solid bases to talk to their children about the importance of a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publicly" he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be notified to the lection "Do not talk to strangers."
Finishing of the unsur's gipful meeting without publishing the Reklame of Lima
The sixth meeting of the presidents of the Union of South America (Unasur) today ended in Peru without publishing the Reklame of Lima, which was previously announced and should be theoretically submitted by the seven present governments.
Efe attempted to get access to the document under subheading at the VI. Orderal meeting of the State and Government heads of the Insurance. The sources of the State and President's office began to share that it would be translated after the clausure, however, explained that it would be published at the Peruanian Government's website for a certain time.
In the case of the text, they indicated that the contents of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, were presented in short statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the meeting was limited at any time.
Only the picture of the president's meeting was in the pressure, without sound, with the "private session, restricted audio" report.
The few information circled by the journalists was received by the press talkers of some of the governments of the Unsures, but not by the Peruanian press speaker.
The only document that was extended during the day was the list of participant Presidents, which showed the hundreds of journalists of different national and international media unappreciation that requested more information.
The President of Peru sent to the media a mail with the "Closed clothes" of the Gipfel meeting, but it was about Humala's designation and not about the official document for the conclusion of the gipfel meeting.
In October last, Peru Gastgetter of the III. Gipfels of South America - Arab States (ASPA) was also published a little, despite the pressure that was called Reklame of Lima, which was previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can convince that the document was published on the last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruanian authorities pointed out that the information systems for journalists would be available, but they limited access to information in a high way.
It also concluded with the common commitment of Chile and Peru, the Court of Justice of Den Haag, which has a limited conflict between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and assured that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in Den Haag, in the process that Lima against Santiago initiated to listen to both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we present in this international court office," said Humala together with the Chilean opposite.
"Chile was, it was, and still remains a country, which believes in international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for conflicts, concludes agreements and submits to the international judges," F. Piñera and welcomed Humala with a hand pressure before the captivity of both countries.
The operation of both Presidents that they would be subject to the IGH has been made after Cookieia, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which was a serious error, had made a complaint against the Bootá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
The presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the unsur since 2011 after his President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The guest president Ollanta Humala opened the talk on the morning and ended the meeting once after midnight in Lima.
The State overseer has lost the final document, which notified that 16 decisions were taken and that the 31 project projects were fixed on a total investment amount of 17 billion.
The decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unsur will be "significant steps towards the goal of a South America State citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights".
He shared that measures would be made to "building cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and the organized, cross-border crimes, and measures to improve access to medicines and to the Internet to low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and in the case of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (latin America) cannot accept triumphing moves, but it must serve to expand our production performance and to show a better future to our people," added Humala.
"We have decided to give a series of 31 emblem projects the priority to improve the space connections in South America, especially in rural and border areas... and thus unify our countries and conclude new economic forms," the Peruanian President said in a reading statement.
In these projects, five peruanians would also be born on the areas of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should provide a better connection with ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also refers to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election in this country serves for its reintegration in the Union of South America," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue a integrated region of welfare and peace and with good neighbourhood relations was another aspect that was pointed out on the meeting.
In this regard, the president of Ko日ia, Juan Manuel Santos, before his participation to the regional meeting, said that he expected a meeting with ◆ contrary to Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict in accordance with a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
"I may be to meet President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will check all these ways - they are not exclusively, and also make the Nicaragua Agreement needed talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to say to the President Ortega that we will be civilized and treated as respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intended to be present at the meeting of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the meeting, the Defence Minister of the Block was also in the context of the defence of the Action Plan for 2013, in which the dialogue and consciousness should be strengthened in respect of the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Ko Öcuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the president at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today said that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal with the "South America can really learn something from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the sixth meeting of the presidents of the Union of South America (Unasur), which was located in Lima, explained to the State TV in Peru that the Europeans were "committed to the Second World War and to other deficiencies" and "this is practically a father country."
In this regard, he defended the project to create a South America State citizenship which prevents the Member States of the Unsur.
"The free deal of citizens and workers in all South America countries must be achieved, as it is already in the other community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a back in the past," he warned.
The President Ecuadors also encouraged the restructuring of the organization of the Ananian States (OEA) under the prejudice to reduce the influence of the English states and to take into account those who have undertaken the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in contrast, we always submit to the South Americas everything.
"It is uncertain that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights has its sitting in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as an example of the political asylum, which the Ecuador gave to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he would not dure this decision because he had not granted his principles but had followed his "deep democratic values and views of human rights".
He concluded that it has given "based confusions that assange delivers to a third country and its procedures would not be fulfilled."
He also criticized the Swedish Justice, which requested him, to submit to him a audience in the State territory because of a famous sexual delegate, while "the Swedish jurisprudence allows this through a video conference that could be carried out through the message of Ecuadors in London."
Correa explained that it exists that the health and the psychic state of Assange would affect.
"Despite having been in our message, I didn't talk to him, but the newspaper told me that he had a easy problem with the longs, but not a serious thing," said the Ecuador Ecuador.
However, it requires that he takes physical and psychical damage because he is captured in a close room and cannot carry out physical exercises in free.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution for the asyl, the assange has been granted in the Ecuadors message in London since June, is the guarantee of a free letter that he can travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of British, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that it had been given with London to find a solution for the closed reasons of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, but we do not refer this word to this case, but it has given continuous talks.
"The solution for this problem is in the hands of British, Sweden and European legal authorities, because the advocate of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a series of procedures on various instances," he explained.
And "if the United Kingdom is granted this free letter tomorrow, this is the result of my opinion."
And when Sweden Mr. Assange at the Ecuadors message in London or about Skype was asked how the Swedish legal preacher was allowed and made in other cases, the problem was achieved.
Correa used the opportunity to defense the freedom of pressure and said that what he doesn't tolerate is "the mediacy, the evil purposes and the lies that are forced by the free opinion."
"The greatest enemies of the freedom of pressure are not the wicked and perverse, but the bad journalists who try and press for wins," he said.
In this sense, he wished that Ecuador no longer would be managed by such journalists "and not by the banks or the hegemonic and span citizens" and preached that he would be "increasing the revolution in order to continue the way to this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Veto against Paraguay in the Unsur at least until its next elections, and he argued that the body must "reserve the hart and not give any opportunism and none to a legally dressed state" because "the legitimity of democracy in Paraguay has been deteriorated."
The President Ecuadors also maintains the desire of its Cooperianian opposite, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of Den Haag, which contributed to the Maritime State of Nicaragua, to negotiate the sea-right limits between both countries, for "absolutely justified".
Currently, this judgment shall not be implemented.
This is a problem between a South-American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in a common way.
You need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
Similarly, he trusted in a good conclusion of the fight against the sea limits between Peru and Chile before the same courthoof and said, "It is right for Latin America to call international institutions when both countries are committed to take the judgment, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he would be candidate to the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve his mandate, he indicated that he saw this option "with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it was sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would turn away from the political life.
The power has never been personally interested in me, but in such unrighteous circumstances as in Ecuador, this social economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was who guaranteed this probably victory, therefore I need to follow this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as the President, then I'll get back from the public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is decided," he explained.
Correa also refered to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, and he told me that he had traveled for a planned, routineous treatment in Dorthin, and that it would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It doesn't mean a removal in the health condition of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Government Chairman today participated in Lima at the sixth meeting of the EU's Governing Boss of South America (Unasur), which was completed by calling for a regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause for a death because of AIDS is too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of the investigation was performed: HIV.
"It was as if a bomb had been involved," he said about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the Ar without acknowledged success tried to "reduce".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform about it; and this was with such a use that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is, of course, one of the elderly patients of the HIV unity of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio le日 with human immunde Property-virus (HIV) since 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more Stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic avoided to decide "for it led to a sackgase."
At that time, AIDS was a synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with life quality.
However, many people still come to the clinic who don't know anything about their illness and whose virus has already made damage and created their immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after AIDS appears in the world, which is, after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes treatment rightly and the survival of the general population is exactly equal," explained the leader of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was based in April this year by a observed scientific publication.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the architectures since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a deadlife, but the years of survival and quality of life from the effects of the immune system of persons at the start of treatment, and that they had greater opportunities that are not drug dependent: up to 30 years at an estimate of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a number of 500 CD4.
The above expressions simply mean that, in the age of 25, who receives the HIV diagnosis can be "without problems 75 years as he is under control", this expert explained.
In order to correctly arrange this progress, it must be noted that the life expectation of Mexico today is a average of 76 years.
Even if death has been decreased in the past years (in Mexico, the number of persons died in AIDS has been reduced from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNUSIDA's annual report), it is true that since 60% of the patients in the national database appeared.
Only in Jalisco died in 2011 255 persons, and until May this year there are 187 death cases; however, it is assured that since 2005 there are universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
So why do people still die?
- I think the problem isn't access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any health problems in the medicines. The problem is that people come in a far progressive state because they don't know their infection status, i.e. in very late phases of disease.
He says: "9 of the patients comes to us if they already have an associated infection. To influence the global mortality, the early diagnosis is needed, therefore, to offer massive recognition tests for all people in which this is necessary."
This proposal agrees with the experts and officers of the Council Statal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also with the patients like Fabrizio who made his test at a private lab, and this is the only reason because it had made a friend of him, who had already been in the AIDS Phase, and even the Caposi Sarkom (a cancer tumor) which is one of the usual complexity.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I think I'm trying to place three times," you're saying in my case.
The amendment was to improve, I'm eating well, treating sports and taking the medicines.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancers.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, undertake much, have a active, but responsible sex life, I look at my health and the other person," recalls Fabrizio, who agrees to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate those who today have been in the world's AIDS.
You should do the test if they belong to a group of risks. If they know whether they are HIV-effective, better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsiblely as all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind Ladentic
Among the health programmes and the simple citizen are large lowers, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted HIV.
And the most important is the prevention.
In the certain places, "the distribution of condoms has been actually increased; before they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with hundred pieces, what is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people have a number of risks for new infections.
"Why do you need this?" is a broadly question of social workers, school orientation staff, apologists and health systems, which do not want youths to exhibit, the correspondent assured.
He proposed to resume this ineffective distribution; the condomes should not be only behind the Ladentic but in the public toilet of institutions that are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted by promiscuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question whether they would be distributed preservatively under its administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like this; it's best to draw the condoms closer to those who have already exercised a sexual activity," he put it on the point.
Key data by Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is nationally viewed at 4st place of new and cumulated AIDS cases and 13.
92% of the inflammation occur on sexual traffic, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 persons that don't know for each registered case.
After the United States' professional court has made a sentence that does not recognise the restructuring of the commitments of the Vitro group reached by a trade concurrence in Mexico, an unrealistic presentation for each national company with lower releases in the neighbouring country will be created with payment problems.
It is therefore possible to say that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow mexican laws are not valid in the country of Stars and Stripes in contrast to international agreements.
In the practice, the recognition of the judgment made on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Court of Justice in Bancarrotas for the North District in Texas leads to the exemption of the Mexican companies of their property on the side of the Bravo Fluxe.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico Port and Tor to call the head of the United States for three inconsistencies.
Since the judge of the matter points out that the believer must be subject to the United States Concurrence Act, the Court of Procedure of Fifth Circuit with Sitz in New Orleans says that it is in the main procedure on the trade concurrence treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for paying incapacity of companies with a transitional profile is not .
In fact, for this purpose, the model law of the United Nations has been established for the integration of the international trade law, whereas the American Law Institute was established as a schlicher.
Secondly, the sentence states that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the commitments in the competition mass of Vitro with their mother society, the majority of the need to restructure commitments would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was allowed.
There are half decades, including Agremex and Comercial Mexico, whose commitments under the group were held by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundes Institute for Trade Courses).
It is also appropriate that, following the votes of the votes, the believers of Vitro, the believers who complained against Vitro against the courts of the United States, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, have not reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 Pro' against 37 Pro.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Procedure.
On the other hand, Vitro has been charged for its difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the large economic crisis in the United States which has granted the country a fight.
That is why the González Sada family is opposed to the same professional court to make the vote in the plenary, which is, by all judges, because only three votes on it.
If it is not placed, the Cerciorare appeal will be introduced, which requests the review of the procedure by an institution, in this case by the Chief Court of the United States.
The difficulty in this case is that the Court has made a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura friendus curiae (Friend of the Court), in which the procedure made by Vitro is described under the Trade Concurrence Act, and in which it is indicated that it had been dealt with the agreements under the two countries to comply with the Chapter 15 of the United States Concurrence Act.
It is noted that the country has underlined the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for International Commerce, such as the rules for the cases of cross-border payment incapacity which guarantee the equality of debtors and believers.
Double-handed carambols: a shot for Vitro and for the country.
General Bi
After the statements of the Mexican Air Trade Association against the former owner of Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a disturbing administration, have not been predicted several months, the Association Sõal de Pilotos Aviadores (Pilotos Aviadores) has finally progressed.
Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now introduced a criminal procedure against the National Bank and Value Paper Commission, which will be prevented by justice.
The supervisory response has then systematicly refused to inform the Republic's main administration of a transaction carried out by the undertaking to decline from the bank F/589 of the Bank IXE on the name of Mexicana de Aviation 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of actors of the Professional de Hotels (the professional hotel manager).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main actor of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is converted
At a meeting on the weekend at a forum of the Caribbean University, a group of national and foreign environmental, academics, undertakers and general members of the citizen society decided to create a wide front to resist the exhibition of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a big sale and trade area in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country on the side of the wall, in addition to a residence area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the context, Canacintra (the national room of the processing industry) has reached to join the governments in the south-East to resist the monumental institution, which destroyed the areas that are partly devastated and represented the mother of all the threats of the industry.
OUTA is dead.
Since the Government of a request from the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances of the Mexican Messenger in Japan undertaken the anti-counterfeiting trade Agreement, which is under the English decline TA, the issue has already been issued in accordance with the Mexican Institute for intellectual property.
As you know, these measures were made, despite the Senate had made the possibility without consideration, because he considered them as a disturbance against the free opinion in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In pursuance of long-term liabilities without an impact on short-term commitments, the building company Homex provides over 500 million pesos on the market.
The emission is the first of four emissions the same, which promises a tax payment every 28 days.

The corresponding investments are more than 1,5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The worldbumper of the basketball, Hector "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the corb sport for more than 60 years, and has prepared the whole world.
A few in Puerto Rico have a so large spiritual collection of the history of the basketball of the country such as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was connected to the Roll Steel in 2008, Rexes was 6 years old part of this sport, if it were players of lower classes, players of the first national Liga, Employers and leaders in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or the president of the Basketball Connection.
"My life long I have placed many guards in the basketball, even several at the same time when I was the President of the BSN, head of the national community and the President of the Foreign Affairs in the 1990s," Reyes recalled at a home of Primera Hora in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his trusted wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not overcome this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and reminders of his long kare and testify them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional reminders are those who at his time remind the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year-old Jubileum as an employer or business leader of the club.
"This was my best years I enjoyed mostly because I had been a part of eight masterships of the Vaqueros since 1967 to be a business leader, a business leader or a treaty.
There were many filled years, and the five masterships followed each other from 1971 to 1975.
And then I split off with a mastership in 1981, the year of the debt of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who was here as Tra Capulete and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very powerful and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had ever.
Bartow then recommended the freewurf specialist Raymond Gausse, who left the citizens and was one of our best advertisers.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a Bayamon mastership, Gausse would take care of another.
The Mastership of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the band in 1988.
At that time, he suggested to enjoy his full-streams and those of Mincy in the national community.
I still know when we wined the first time in the predolympical tour in Mexico against the United States.
Then the World Mastership comes in 1990, where we set the fourth place, which would have been abroad if it had not been this Canadian Schied Judge who let us repeat the last game round for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the World Mastership 1990 the best nationality you ever saw?
It belongs to the best, as well as those who won the Olympiade in 2004 against the dream team.
My favorite, however, is the community of the Pan-American games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and bought the United States team a battle, as when they won Bronze against us at the World Mastership.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, which could not be in 1990 because of a geneatic hurt.
A community that may not have been the best in relation to personalities but we have won a golden medaille and prepared us great joy was those of the predolympical tourist in 1995 in Newquen, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Neves, Pablo Alice and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the locked players because of the predictions on the Panamy Games in Mar del Plata, we won every prognose of gold medaille.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was without doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tours are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculin.
And this, without taking into account his runways in the different bodys in which he played.
Who was the best tree from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good treasures such as Julio Toro, Flor Melléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armmandito Torres.
I like the boy's work of Leo Arrill.
What do you think you're the best you've reached in the band?
I was part of the most important era of the national community from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 90s to 17 men in a season.
What else are you doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalization of the below category.
For example, that the boys in Ponce are playing only in their territory and only taking the national playoffs on families from other ears of the island.
Today, children do unnecessaryly many travels and games.
At least I see the results of the predicted training and courses for Tra ’, table-of-official and divisions judges.
I'm proud of it.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my uncle children and leave and go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role than John Ross Ewing, better than "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a screwled, homely and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the Oilmagnat J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dellas" has become a symbol of the Habgier of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new staff of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complication, in accordance with the family's Press report by Warner Bros., Production of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his loved birth town Dallas, where he played the iconic role that most of them was to him," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the festival.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas' hospital, her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made the joy of all who knew him.
He was creative, magnificent, funny, funny, loved and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was a original person and lived in full moves," Gray explained in a message.
Hagman was born in 1992, and he told that he had been drinking much over years.
1995 was found a bad tumor in his liver, and he was subjected to a transplantation.
In the years ago, Hagman was in television as a fine type in the 1965s to 1970s with the Sitcom "Freening Jeannie" of the NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life will be placed on his head when he met an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also producers of two comedians, which were only a short time, such as the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His kinoworks belonged to the critical roles in the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his mastery interpretation of the surprising J.R., which Hagman made to a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the Ewing Clan and other figures in their environment was spread from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who shot on J.R."? the expectation of a episode of full emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to a international speculation, and millions were injured in legal houses.
That is why the series reached a review record at that time.
When the answer was made in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by average 41 million viewers, the "Dallas" to the second of the most seen interview programme since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Christian, the weak of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had wounded her and threatened her to be prostituted if she didn't leave the city, but others also had reasons to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, unseed man with a charismatic garbage: a sustainable businessman and an unbelieving husband who then tried to put his wife in alcoholcraft Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to be on the J.R. gravestone," Hagman said 1988.
It should be called "Here the honourable citizens of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, representative of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "oral personality on and outside of the screen".
He is unforgettable and unforgettable for millions of worshippers in the world and remains in our hearts those who had the happiness to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were spent a few months ago with great success in the TNT TV.
The record of five chapters for the second staff was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, informed the sender.
By warner or TNT there was no immediate clothes about how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the watch player and song Mary Martin, the classic works such as "South" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a young man when she got Larry during her marriage with a lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his happiness in the theater towns in New York beginning of the 50s, then served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he knew the young designer Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived a long time in the California city Malibu, where many popularities have their home.
2001 he titled his memories "Hello Darlin: Number (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything about which I thought it could hurt someone or affect him in any wise," said the press in his time.
After hepatic transplantation, he placed himself as volunteers in a hospital to assist terrible patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are undertaken and then," he explained 1996.
I want some comfort to them, such as "no, it's a little unbequem in the first time, but it's going to be good for you."
Similarly, he set up against smoking and shared in several campaigns.
Start the course that studys the "the end of the world"
Each week, students examine Apocalyptic subjects such as the atmosphere, zombies, virus and keime and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious Professor concluded to stop a course over the end of the world, knew that he was over an inconsistent angelhaken: the end of the "long backward talk" of the Maya calendar on 21 December, from which many people believed that it was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the Zerspéerian Hurrikan Sandy, which some of them had taken as the "deurmageddon" and a growing conflict under Israel's share, the place from which the Christian theoretics believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most Apocalyptic semester that was ever," Charme said this week to students at the University of Rutgers Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyses what happened today in the world, as if we had been removed from 30 days, this would be a real period.
And he reminds that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor that offers this semester, which should be the last in history, courses over the "the end of the world".
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker provides the course "Medium, culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students examine Apocalyptic subjects such as the atmosphere, zombies, virus and keime and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are spread with time," he said, as well as how hypothetic scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behaviour.
If more nuclear material is reached in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could be interrupted.
This month the students analysed the films with a Apocalyptic content and examined how they were compared to the real life.
"I've tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, believed and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the Professor for Latin American History Matthew Reë and his college Amara Solari, designed a team to provide a team with the clear term "The end of the world".
"We don't take up 2012 so that we can always keep the option to keep the course again, for the case that the world doesn't undergo," Re >
Despite the "previous steps" students must study, create projects and participate in final tests.
In Penn State, the final test is carried out at the previous evening of the apocalyps, therefore the students have no other chance than to continue working until night, where the world is going to end, "reached Re >
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there was no place any more" Re > said about his course for students with a high average of 35 students.
We have received e-mails from students who asked if they were still free.
Students assure that the currency is counted to the interested students.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to treat themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers chamber for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious menality is only a question of comfort or failure.
The 25-year student Will Wekesa for psychology and hospitalists explains that all Apocalyptic films have been seen.
"I never heard anything about a teaching where this is learned," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no one of the students - and less than one of the students - said to believe at the last date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of Mayas, and in a certain way we discreded them," said Julie Zeglen, student in Temple last year, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Re日.
However, he notes that in the Western Society there is a Apocalyptic Property that brings back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the predictation of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculate.
"The people don't think that otherwise," he says.
This is mainly in the English world of the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor of the University of La Salle, who teaches the Philippines this year, replies quickly to the question whether he would know a course about "the end of the world".
"The Philippines don't participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an enthusiasm to a exception of an instance.
We have a favor from Daddy.
Reʹ pointed out that the last court had been spoken many days over the years, and said that if it wasn't happening on 21 December, "the people immediately thought of a new date" or philosophy that on 21 December of the beginning of a seven-year period, on which the end of the world was coming.
Students and Professors easily take this date.
Many said they wanted to celebrate "the end of the world".
"I probably call a few friends to let us laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year student for communication.
