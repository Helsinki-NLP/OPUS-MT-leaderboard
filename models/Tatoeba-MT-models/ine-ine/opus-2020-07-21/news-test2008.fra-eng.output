Inflation, in Europe, has dealt with the food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the quick breeding of food prices.
In November, in the 13 countries of the euro area, prices were more important than the previsions, after an inflation rate of 2,6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3,1 per cent was recorded, indicated the Office of the Statistics of the European Community in Luxembourg.
The official previsions indicated only 3 per cent, Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian Central Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the rate of direct interest by saying that the reduction of interests, with the growth of primary materials and the low rate of unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationist spirit.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but nearly two percent.
According to an analysis, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "the inflation must be dissuaded" so that it should not be more to intervene on this issue later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3,3 per cent is a record during the last twelve years and in Spain, the inflation rate was from 3,6 to 4,25 per cent in Spain.
Inflation in the euro area has resulted in rapid consumption of food and energy prices.
The market quotas at the end of cereals increased by 88 per cent, and the soja course also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and milk products also increased in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil increased by 52 per cent and, last month, a black gold barle costs almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will exceed 2,1 in this year, to 2,5 per cent, but in 2009 it will decrease at 1,9.
According to analyses, the inflation rate of 12 months remains around 3 per cent, however, the average annual rate of 3 to 4 months will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease the direct rate two times in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Parties of Fidesz (Young Democracy Alliance) has increased significantly the beginning of December, thus since 2002, it has now been the largest number of parties, while Gallup (Institut of investigation) has never previously found such low socialist support, which is 13 per cent.
For faithful electors, the difference would, due to the greatest determination of opposition electors, represent a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a five (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungrian socialist party).
According to the investigation, MDF (Hungary Democratic Forum) and SZDSZ (Free Democracy Alliance) are under Parliamentary level: their support is two per cent in the whole population.
On the faithful electors of voting, the number of parties in both parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate in comparison with the lowest point, the proportion of those who believed that the economic situation in the country had never been so serious, it was 41 per cent and 46 per cent supplementary.
According to the most optimistic perspectives of the early and the latest, the families are more pessimists than their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population provides an increase and only one tenth provides a improvement in the situation.
In December last, 71 per cent of the surveyed persons, namely a majority of those who had never seen in the previous reviews of Gallup, decided that the Prime Minister did his work rather than well.
13 per cent of the surveys have confidence or many trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent are not confidential to the Prime Minister and 27 per cent to the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of the company who thinks that the misconsideration against the Prime Minister can be treated without a change in government.
As the last October issues, 35 per cent of the investigations wanted the Government and the Prime Minister to remain in force, this rate represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the absence of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
In the matter of vote, 60 per cent of the audits answered that they would certainly vote and 20 per cent additional say they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "selecting islative to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the investigations would certainly participate and 15 percent of additional would probably participate.
74 per cent of people would not say to inscription rights in higher education, 79 per cent would not say to consultation costs and 84 per cent would not say to hospital residence costs.
When we look at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote to the Referencendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would refuse the introduction of inscription, consultation costs and residence costs.
Auchan is the most dear, Tesco has increased its prices of nearly twenty percent
The hypermarketing in Budaörs' commercial triangle maintained the average price estimation of 16 per cent of the last year to the difference that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in Budaörs' commercial triangle, the Common County Panel also increased by 16 per cent in average, an increase in value just above thousand forints was shown in all hypermarked.
The prices, which had already been involved in the large food stocks in December last, have not increased brutally in comparison with the higher basis.
However, consumers are obviously surprised to see that the articles purchased just below nine thousand forints last year cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Hypermarket Panel has exceeded 91 forints, at least 10 thousand forints, the psychological level of 10 thousand forints.
And the highest value of the pair was assembled to 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6 800 forints.)
The prices of the Uncum and the living fish have remained almost at the level of the last year, however, the prices of dental, noise and pavot have increased.
In the magazines, the price of fresh and bread followed the data of KSH (Center Statistics Institute) but at Auchan, only 139 forint bread was found.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, too, in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it costed only 257 forints the consigned bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of Paner daily, Auchan was the most dear and Cora was the less dear.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of his Daily Panel by 15 per cent, while Tesco and Auchan increased them from about 18 and 18 per cent respectively.
By comparing the lovers of the last year and the less lovers of this year, we find a divorce of 12 per cent, while the difference between the less lovers of the last year and the lovers of this year is 21 per cent.
The prices increased from 1 480 forints in average.
Last year, prices increased from 1 206 average forenses, knowing that the impact of the VAT rates had already been observed in the last year's Christmas prices.
This process made the trade perplexe, and the hypermarketes could not determine what margin to apply on products so far as they could not predict the impact of the change of prices on consumption.
(If a trademaker fails to calculate the rotation of a product, it can lose a great profit on the margin adjusted to the trade intensity.)
As a result of the change in the rate of the VAT, the prices of the daily Panel developed so much that the lovers of the carryer was more than 1 720 for the value of the 2006, while the difference between the lovers of the lovers was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so significant because the lovers of the carryer was more than 1 630 forints than the last year, and the prices of less lovers increased by 1 284 forints too.
Recovering the two hours of Christmas, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumption articles increased more than 30 per cent in hypermarketing.
(This is not necessarily confirming KSH data: for certain foods of first need, the statistics Institute has found an increase in prices of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case for example of egg and egg.)
According to the Daily Panel of this last, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, already the last year, has increased more than 10 per cent in comparison to the basis.
According to the indicators, feed suppliers take a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded to accept brutal prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hypermarketes are not plaguing, they are continually recording good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers do not look at the prices in the three visited hypermarkets.
They buy all in quantity, they take long conservation food by palettes.
Thursday morning, the major queues were formed in the boxes of the three hypermarks because the number of customers increased brushfully.
However, our information, the number of businesses is less important in the province, many multinationals are concerned about not even reaching the estimated number of businesses, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption articles.
Many hospitals make economies on desinfectants
This year, more than thousand infections, mainly caused by wrong use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the number of beds insufficient, the supermanagement of the medical staff do not help block infections, states the doctor head of the National Centre of epidemiology.
Many hospitals also make economies on disinfectants
There was no longer a MRSA infection in the Janos hospital traumatology service.
The resisting antibiotics was detected on a hospitalized man after a serious accident.
The disease was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred at the same place.
The wound of a serious car accident came out of the hospital but a little after it had to return to it because of a MRSA infection and, since then, the doctors couldn't make him an important operation because of the agency that is located in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1 094 hospital infections generated by a multiresident pathogen agent have been declared to the NSA, Karolina Böröcz, a doctor of the National Centre of epidemiology.
To know that this is the number of infections caused by a multiresident pathogen agent who has been actually recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSAs, otherwise said by staphylococcus residents in methicilline-oxaciline.
One third of people are porters of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their nose without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (as angins, amigdalites, skin infections, traumatic infections) are well reacting to antibiotics, they are easily healthy.
However, if antibiotics are used in a manner of practical or inappropriate way, the antibiotics, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistance to antibiotics that will quickly spread in bad hospital conditions.
In the case of a temporary or prolonged function of the immune system, this disease may cause serious hospital infections, such as trauma infection or sexicemia, on age, small weights or infirm body.
According to the doctor of the hospital Janos, there is nothing particular in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospitals' day.
You should not especially confuse the infection with the epidemic, you do not find MRSA only or not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SA resists antibiotics.
"These diseases are isolated, the healthy staff makes caoutcho and protection masks and we have adjusted antibiotics to heal them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Firstly, hospitalized diseases are examined if they are MRSA portors, but infection cannot always be avoided.
The template is not in mode
The majority of MRSA infections could be predicted but the current conditions and circumstances are not favorable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multiresident pathogen agents, Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection appears especially in hospitals and residents for elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalized diseases and immediately isolate MRSA diseases.
However, microbiology is not at the mode in Hungarian hospitals.
It is necessary to know that the National Social Safety Case does not financ these reviews.
Most of the cases see the day only if MRSA infection is detectable on the disease, the doctor said head of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the adjusted use of antibiotics in humum medication and there are also Hungarian directives for the health of certain infections and syndromes.
An antibiotic therapy needs to be endeavored, otherwise, microbiological examinations should be performed in order to prevent antibiotic treatment, but hospitals do not always take account of them.
The realization of microbiological premiums is even rare in ambulatory care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals make economies on desinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one disease to another as often through the medical staff.
It is therefore primarily to lay hands, to put hands and protection masks, but important lakes are also found in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of gouttelets and by contact. However, because of conditions in Hungarian hospitals, contaminated disease cannot always be isolated.
Moreover, the rooms are often filled, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemic, the diseases should be removed from one of the other from 1,5 meters at least.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situation, make economies on disinfectants, deficiencies, diseases are many, so the risk of pollution is even greater, indicated by Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in demonstrable way or then the proliferation of the patogen agent can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenditure for social security boxes, therefore fighting overall against this infection.
For example, the Government established a programme to prevent or reduce MRSA's incidence.
According to data, this programme is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in the territory.
The European Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) shows, among its priorities, the prevention of the incidence of multiresident patients (as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogenic agents.
The Commissioner, author of a mortal accident, was not in the state of beverage
The official statement on mortal age caused by the Commissioner of the 22th Arrondissement was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22th Arrondissement, the demissioner of his post since, who has broken a peeton by providing his death last Thursday, would have led to a state of beverage or extortion, which held on Friday Attila Morvai, portfolio of the Public Ministry of the Capital after the related fact has been established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the request that already found that the ex-Commissary had not consumed alcohol before the flight
Last Thursday, the former chief of the 22th Arrondissement committee was cut off a 55-year-old man who was in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in the Kossuth Lajos street of the 22th Arrondissement. The man wanted to pass through the road not by the past for petroleums.
(In addition, the fact that he passed the road outside the passport for petrol is not an attentive circumstances, ­ the Road Code of a car that enhances a virage must leave the pieces.)
The peeton died after it was transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner denied his post and asked his retraite because, by the police communication, this accident was very disturbing it.
The request on this matter is carried out by the Budapest Parquet.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the ex-Commissary co-operated the beginning with the judges charged to conduct the request.
400 million additional euros for infrastructure
Janos Veres, minister of Hungarian funds, and Marta Gajecka, President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed, Friday, in Budapest, three agreements of a total value of 400 million euros on a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of 300 million euros for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties; this time, the signed contract concerns the use of 200 million EUR remaining.
The 150 million euro credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of projects related to education.
The EIB totally approved a sum of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million could be used later after the extension of the credit contract.
The Parties signed a 50 million euro contract for innovation, the state budget will first use this contribution in the research and development project to achieve the Debrecen University.
During negotiations, the project of line 4 of the metro was also addressed.
The parties agreed that they would revise the possible change of the initial contract when Hungary will complete the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to Janos Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted EUR 8,4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its credits to EURIBOR, with a period of 8 years and without commitment.
Bulgaria, Paradise of the EU's Immobiliary Market
The development of the Bulgarian immobiliary market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this country of Balkans, which was not quoted in the past.
What, or who and who have bought on this EU market, which is still the less dear but who will become quickly dear?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is the most favorable goal of East Europe with its ski apartments and homes at the border of the good market.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, at the border of the sea, Albena, the "Guld Salts", the "Sozopol Cote", the old Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are more increasingly looking for an immortal in Kavarna and Balcik region.
According to the analyses of Re/Max Bulgaria, soon or later, the country's central region, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also wake the interest of investors and are also much more to buy in Russia's loving corner.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade and office surfaces promise the highest amortement rate.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the season and winter season, also in the two other samples of the year.
The most supervisory investors already buy a large number, for example in Bansko's corner.
According to the analysts, people buying an immovable in Bulgaria are at the same time seeking to change their lives, their lives.
Most of the purchasers are → but others come from France, ↑, Spain, and more from Romania.
Malta and Cypriot investors are also present. At the border of the Black Sea and in the most reputed ski stations, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are able to install themselves buy renewable, to a price variant between 50 and 100 billion euros, or old deployed houses, to a price from 5 to 15 billion euros, which are then renewed.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, nearby a large city, magazines and generally the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residence buyers (after December, Bulgaria has been quoted among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who are purchasing the hope of performing a higher average or long-term value.
The price of capital immovable increases without prejudice to a stronger request.
In the European Union, the immobilious prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, however, in the last five years they increased by 21 per cent each year.
Immobiliary prices are mainly exceeding the payment.
Fodor and six per cent of Hungarian
According to the Communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister for Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals end on Thursday, however, on Monday, after official opening, will continue the negotiations of Ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and political men coming from 192 countries of the world will discuss the Fe’s Road of Bali to determine the efforts to be made after the period of reduction of emissions set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this time, living discussions on this matter are held between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also pointed out that, at the moment, they did not want to discuss precise numbers, however they were ready to sign a reduction agreement until 2020, from 25 to 40 per cent in comparison to 1990.
Another important issue of the conference is to see whether developed countries are committed, without reducing emissions, to provide financial and needed assistance to countries.
A agreement was also signed on the assistance to developing countries.
The aid fund set by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Government Council of 16 members, probably within the framework of the United Nations Environment Fund (GEF), which Piac is Profit (Marché and Profit).
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role in amiral vessel in global efforts to protect climate and to encourage the signature of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reduce its gas emissions by 20 per cent in comparison to the level reached in 1990, independent of the successful signature of the ‘Accord after 2012’, and was ready to reduce them to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to take commitments adapted to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol signatory countries aimed at a reduction of 5.2 per cent, and the 15 EU members at that time took the commitment of 8 per cent at least.
Hungary has taken the commitment to reducing emissions of gases of weight by 6 per cent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, and our country will comply with its commitment, reminds the pressure of the Ministry of Environment.
The injury is large in Bali because the international long-term climate policy agreement should be established within two years, other than the entry into force of the Agreement would certainly be repealed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system which has been highlighted in the new IPCC report, international scientific body, which has obtained the Nobel price of the United Nations peace, in order to take care of climate changes.
The reduction of emissions would be lost and the average temperature of the Earth of more than 2 degrees could no longer be avoided who, scientists, had extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British Army recruited on YouTube
The British Army units, on the video Sharing site, provide records made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
On the other hand, this is the British Air Force (RAF) that has passed for YouTube: the special units involved in Afghanistan are loading video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, announced by the BBC.
These records are controlled in the general quarter of air force operations to Kandahar and are then transferred to London or the partners carrying them on the Internet.
The political message is inconvertable
The air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this road and their "change" has been viewed by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Defence Minister was recorded in the name of "Defenceheadquarters" in the early 2007 and videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Minister (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own chain on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos have passed on the network to recruit, and the Defence Minister also will be made to inform the major public the real objectives of the presence of the army in the foreign.
The propaganda by this way costs practically nothing in relation to ordinary recruitment publicities passed by the television, at BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consulting in defence, but it also brings an inevitable political message because it justifies the well-fonded military operations decided by the Government.
Americans have made a game
The army is embedded because, outside the videos composed and carefully censured, videos of amateurs have passed on the share site, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocrites, officers do not avoid talking about losses but never present the blooding side of the battle.
Moreover, many videos had already passed on the net presenting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were performed in real mission, but the British Army has not been packed for the load of these videos only a short time.
The Americans make the recruitment a little differently using the American's Army fusillade game freely downloadable. In this game the player can place soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Boy tombola and beaches in the ministry
Monica Lamperth, minister of work, is not emotional: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-year meeting with its employees that will be able to say adequate in 2007 by taking kidneys and coffee.
Another minister will organize a festival with live music, another will encourage the officers with a tombol and offer a drink to create a ambition of Christmas.
Festival, ambition of Christmas, concerts and buffet, so the power was fun.
The authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, the greatest Christmas Festival will be organized by the Defence Minister, but these are not the employees of the minister who will be invited there.
At Noël, the Orphelins, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive cadeals for the missionary birthday, the family of the soldiers who are currently working in foreign missions will be invited and a press receipt will also occur.
The Ministry provides a budget of 25 million forenses to create the end-year environment.
In comparison with other ministers, the National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM's festival will be held in the Future House with a total budget of 4 320 000 forints and, on the six hundred large employed, three hundred fifty were expected.
At this festival, the ambition of Christmas will be rigorous, there will be actors and a tombola.
The NFU Christmas costed 4 700 000 forints and was organized on Thursday in the Budget of the National Justice Council (OIT) with concerts and a dinner.
The location of the room costs a million forints, the rest was costed for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFU service is invited to another Christmas Festival, organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, Agency Management Society.
The building of the Theatre of the Guideness has been praised for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not succeeded to join the responsible.
Costum is not obligatory
The OIT building was not only the NFU but the Minister for Justice and Police, who, instead of a Christmas festival, organized a ball at the occasion of the Holy Luca on 7 December.
The OIT did not pay them the use of its rooms.
This ball counted five hundred people.
The festival began by the words of the Minister's welcome and the dinner followed a dancing night on life music.
Reply to the question of [origo]: the dinner wedding was not of all obligation to this ball.
Health, Labour and Local Collection Ministers prepare a party once.
The Ministry of Health will organize a spectacle and a festival for its employees in its walls for 400 000 forints.
On the contrary, Monnika Lamperth, Minister of Work, invites his employees not officially to a Christmas festival but to an end-year working meeting.
An hundred and twenty persons are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat coffee, with the press service, and the festival will also cost 350 000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, the Ministry of Local Collections, will simply invite his employees to take a glass in the Ministry of Local Collections and Territory Association.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas Festival in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It costs 2.500 forints by invitation including a buffet and a glass.
Since Janos Veres' array, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
Without planned feast environment, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's exposure but also by the time of the festival in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a receipt on 20 January to celebrate the new year, the Christmas Festival will not be held.
The receipt will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, held at the City Boss, and ­ the communication of the ministry, 1.000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred invited.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats of credit in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are taken by a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modesty feed.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Cultural Ministry did not celebrate all of this for Christmas, and the respective pressure services had been held at [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of Environment was not aware of the price of the official Christmas Festival.
Nevertheless, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of the decrative art.
The forces of the green mega are racing
The Syndicates of the Ligue and the National Association of Ova Councils will be, on Friday, their Green Committee which will be charged to make the undetermined greenhouse on Monday.
Samedi, a General Protection Assembly will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on health chains, the Green will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant bowls in the employment because the railway traffic will be stopped almost totally and the BKV salaries (common transport society) will also take up to 13 hours.
The Syndicates of the Ligue will inform on Friday after Monday the details of their Monday's holiday, organized with the National Ova Council Association.
The LIGA Green Committee - MOSZ will also be established and will serve as coordinator of Monday action.
Samedi, a General Protection Assembly will be held and, since Monday, the organizations associated with the Greece will stop the work for an undetermined time if they cannot find an agreement with the Government.
This means that the date of the end of the greenhouse, from the day of the vote to Parliament on health cases, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the law on health boxes, the syndicats will immediately revoke the call to the Greece.
On the contrary, if the law is voted, the Great Committees will meet and decide to take once.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is worth that the vote on the law on health cases should be lately, even even night.
As a result of the greenhouse for Monday, important bowls are provided in the Propertyation: iron roads will stop the work for an undetermined time and during the morning a part of the common transport to Budapest and more than half of Volán companies can be arrested.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the road will also be locked.
Many civil syndicates and organizations have joined the call to the Greeve, and the list of these are permanently updated on the site of the Ligue.
Certain organizations indicate to make a decree for an undetermined time, and others stated a temporary labour delay.
Until Thursday after Thursday, the MÁV (Hungrian ferry Chemins) and the Free Syndicat of Cheminotes (VDSZZZ) have not been able to find an agreement on minimum services, or, at the approach of Christmas Festivals, more are those who take the train.
According to the current communications, the common transport of Budapest will take care of the start of service until 13 hours, the Budapest airport between 7 and 9 hours of the morning, the Electricity and the Termical Energy Syndicate of the Ligue will make a four-hour breath, the Professor Syndicat and the Democratic Syndicat of Professors have called to take care of respectively for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours.
The National Physician Association will take care of in all other countries, the Syndicat of health and social workers (EDDSZ) in SZEF will make a two-hour warning warning.
The most important of the four complaints, formulated by the Ligue, requires that the Government repeat its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second recruit requires that the new retraite calculation method to be introduced in several steps from the next year.
The third recruit wants a guarantee in the field of retraction before the age, which would allow the functions that deserve it before 2010 to pass into the system.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Travel Syndicat (VDSZZZ) has rejected the Ligue Syndicates, the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Capital Policy: Hungarian Garde has increased the risk of country
According to the Division of the risk of Political Capital (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Garde, which is latest, with the support of Jobbik Magyarhorzhágert Mozgalom (Movement for a better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risico warning”, the company notes that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Garde, the largest political risk is already that “in short terms of aggressive ethnic conflicts may occur after the increase in the existing ethnic stress between the Tzigan and the non-Tzigan population of Hungary”.
The research Institute said that the political strategy of the Hungarian Garden aimed at providing this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main lacunes of the Hungarian political actors: “The public actors have passed the public debate on Rome's case to the representatives of radical and extreme political groups based on a political strategy on the difference between the Zigans and the Hungarians”.
The problem is increasing, the normal dialogue becomes impossible, the extremists seem to be strengthened, and the aggressive conflicts are more intense, they say.
However, under the impact of the attention of Hungarian and international media, the activities of the Hungarian Garde “detained significantly the picture of Hungary in the foreign, in particular in the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country. ”
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and extreme rights groups since 2006, many aids have been established in Hungary since the age of 2007 with the name of 'National Autodefence'.
"The common treaty of these races is that they are defined as a civil organization while they say that their adherents are prepared for defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, order defence), armed, if necessary, increasingly, devoting the police incapacity, military, otherwise said of the state," they said.
They reported that everything was happening in accordance with the method that, based on political and partial ambitions of the political society, seeks to distort different political ambitions in a civil aspect.
Therefore, the accent on the civil nature and the status of → is only to avoid the legal stages of the registration of these staff to the court but also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activities of the Hungarian Garde are a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighborhood relations.
“In recent months, many neighbors cite the Hungary Garden as a potential risk source and the ultranationalist political actors of some limited countries want to justifie their anti-Hungary policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Garden.
This affects the political stability of the region,” they said.
According to the research Institute, the Constitution of the Hungary is not a unique phenomena in East Central Europe, political risks have increased in the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Garde, for example, refer to the activity of the Bulgarian National Garde, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in 2007.
The many distress of Romes that have exposed in a quarter of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are originating in the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
With the benefit of these events, the UN decided to be aware by saying that the objective of the organization is "national self-defence".
According to them, in recent 17 years, the Ziganians have “terrified” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the capital policy.
They claimed that the initiative had raised vif debates in the Bulgarian opinion.
As they say, the statement of certain Bulgarian Roman organizations on the constitution of their own guard in the direction of resistance indicates the risk of ethnic affairs.
The function of the Hungarian Garde showing similarities with the Bulgarian National Garde does not exclude that the Hungarian Romans respond to the threat of the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of information from the Telegraph Agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research Institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is carried out every year and if events could have an impact on the change of risk, they report the opinion, such as in the present case, with a risk warning.
Holiday is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the festival days and, around the festivals, it has become urgent to repeat the working days whose number will decrease the next year.
Festivals are not even uniform in the EU and in the United States.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state festival days as well as rest days.
The rest days are often related to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends, and the first day of the new year are also rest days, the last more so that the survivors can rest quietly.
Moreover, in one year, we have on all 11 holidays marked in red.
On 15 March, a national festival, in memory of the revolution of 1848, as well as on 23 October, which is the Memorative Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our status, the 1st May is the festival of work and the 1st and 2th November, we remember the members of our family and our determined friends.
Moreover, we have two days in the Passover, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious festivals are rarely falling on a weekend, Family Calends, it has become hard to repeat the working days in the cases or there is only one working day before or after the booked in red festival.
It is true that we pay the price of the long-term week-end by working or by going to the oil on Saturday and the long-term week-end.
Since long years, the Minister of Work has been established in a special regulation on the days of replacement or after the feasts.
The law was used for all employees and for all their employed salaries, officers and workers in the public service.
However, it is not worth services companies, institutions which turn without interruption and service, by their vocation, and also for rest days.
This year, work days will be held only around the end-year festivals: from 24 December, life is stopped almost throughout the country because experiences the majority of people do in place of additional hours or take vacations that they have economised for these purposes to be able to pass the days between Christmas and the day of the new year with them.
The next year, many festivals fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be less changes at the level of working days compared to this year.
The date will be repeated for the first time around the work festival to allow the salaries to stay with them four days of vacation.
Samedi 25 April will be a working day for a rest day on Friday, 2 May.
Another change is planned for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replaced on Friday 24.
Nevertheless, the next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the festivals because from 24 December, everyone will make a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Thursday.
Six furniture things that can be terrifying the eggs
E-mails we forget to send, vocal messages that we never receive, innocent lies that act almost more: these are things that "reduce" the day of a workplace.
The question is to know whether we are habitual to these anxieties, or if we are dealing with the challenge, and we are consciously avoiding ambiguous situations, which cause concerns to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called the marketing service," said one.
What did you miss a meeting?
It's best forgiveness and try to recover things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he's forgotten to pass the message (it's the least coherent solution).
In most cases, the thing is inclined with excuses.
Before having penitent explications, it is useful to consider how you can cause disadvantaged moments to your age and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you doing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more incredible than to want to take a folder, a office tool or a phone, and you're not going to find them anywhere.
Do you remember the watch you put the agrafy on the office but she disappeared the next morning?
Did you find your feelings that you thought you lost on your office?
Don't take anything to your age without asking, else they have the reason for being disappointed against you because they have sinned their good.
Do not carry out coverages, post-it in your pocket because it can be impatient that there is no more and that you need them immediately.
You're a cup of privacy?
There are no good ways to stop pots that spread.
Who did, with whom?
Or why?
Not to everyone your information (suppositions) on your private life!
If a person shares his intimate secrets with you, don't disappoint his confidence!
Build the shared information in you and do not discuss it with your clusters in his absence even if your clusters are also at the corner.
Are you saying sick without just a motive?
When you call the office and tell you sick in the pretext of a painful head pain because you feel bad or you think you need to rest that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your missions must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't worry about yours!
If you know before that the next day you're not going to work or that something might happen to you that would force you to stay with you, don't forget to prevent your boss and your teachers to avoid that they'll be surprised from your absent next day.
Friendship, raching, phone
You're stuck in your work, but the rebuilding of your eggs is brutal?
You became a witness of a phone discussion that you would better not listen?
Don't interfere with fridnings, songs, high voice discussions (which you are walking above their head), feet, big words, or mixed words expressed by high voice.
They can deteriorate even if your ecstasy is not in a project (editor, design, organization).
Are you accusing others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send a court or a important message, nobody accuses for this forget!
Don't put it on the account of the potential chaos in the office or your brunching!
Recognize him if you have committed a mistake and if it has presented inconvenients to others, prepare the fault!
Ask how you could fix your fault, prepare the ignorance!
Do you feel too much at your office?
Putting a shooting and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't agree to the office!
Don't put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be disappointed, respect your eyegues and yourself by recalling you correctly, and if your function requires it by putting beautiful and legitimate clothes, to go to work!
If you want to answer the expectations, you're not interesting anymore
We're in progress in the usual bowson of the morning.
On the other hand, a special melodie is heard by the radio: the voice of a violon with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm going up the sound.
Music changes of rythme and lowness comes to accompany the tons of all the time, then a female coral comes to join it as a real beauty.
Mr2 distributed the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungarian musical life hasn't seen us for a long time with a well-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems that the buchon becomes different if you listen to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some new interesting productions from the Hungarian digital underground begin to change the image of enonderboi and, despite the new way of the garage rock covering the guitar, the Hungarian electrop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Záger arrived from PÃ©s and played himself in the Yonderboi group before he started on his own way, perhaps because there is no place for two feet in the same shot.
His project (Zagar) and its music, a jazz, electronic dance music, and pop music, began to come to know when it was given to him the composite of filmed sound tracks (e.g.
The Session of Ferenc Török).
The training playing in small clubs began to be known by a larger public when the wan2 magazine quoted their first album in 2002 among the fifty most important disks of the Hungarian market and announced Zagar, with Yonderboi, the nearly only Creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his enemy became in日 "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to bring this label well.
The group reacted as necessary, he went out a new and better disc.
The titled album Can Walk Fly Instead, recently out, can open new ways for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the past years in PÃ©s.
It was a line of the former Pês group of Balázs Zságer.
We are well there with the reference to the flight but near the air music now appears, according to the spirit and tendance of the time, to guitate it stronger, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, currently working in literature with the Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs at the first of the album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, a real tube for the radio is found, Mr.2 Petõfi, distributing the popular music of the morning tonight, began to introduce Wings of Love melodies recorded with six Hungarian songs ("Underground Divas").
Everything's fine (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube moves me to ask a question: Is your music quite a music with a certain bed?
Zságer Balázs: The music term with a certain bed doesn't tell me much.
For me there are two castles in the music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but honest and commercial music.
Musics that say alternative, underground can also be mediators and only made to sell them and become commercials.
However, a good pop song can also be honest.
The recipient attitude also works in this spirit independently of the language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign public, is one or another more open to your music?
Zs.B.: In the foreign, especially in the west, music has older traditions.
It is, people go to concerts, not only the youths of a say or twenty years but also the elderly.
They follow with much more attention the changes in the musicale because they think that it is also part of the modern culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously happy to see that people come more to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to reach a goal but for a specific reason.
The public's role is more important to concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is only considered in the unseenable changes of the time.
But I noticed that if you want to answer the expectations of the public, you will not be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you account to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has made career instead of west.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his way even if some people sometimes try to find tracks in our music.
Instead, we are team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let's let it explode.
At first, it was very sure that our music should be compared to Yonderboi because we are more to leave his group and take another way.
hvg.hu: On the palmarès of Mr. Peõfi, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many have heard Zagar's name for the first time by the way of this song.
Do you have this most popular one you've opened consciously to a wideest cup?
Zs.B.: We haven't planned to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to add the orgy of sounds and the most difficult topics on the whole disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why were they - what the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a coral of the kind of gospel.
We had the idea of composing this coral of good solists from the Hungarian musical scene.
So the coral was composed to six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Jude Neemeth, who then were baptized underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or the girls have made it a little?
Zs.B.: This song already existed a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was something left in this song.
The sequence of agreements reached the voice of the song.
I sang even the melodie that the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terriblely spontaneous.
I remember that this has caused me to be crucial at the time, but we certainly needed Divas.
Avec my voice wouldn't have had the same force.
hvg.hu: On the disk and on the concert, I also felt that girls were in the back.
There is no ground (except a single short of Judy Jay), they have no single role, they all sing in-- and they don't sing stronger than music, so music makes it only to join their song.
They were back on the scene too.
Does he want it?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind is only to technical problems.
On the contrary, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute solist roles.
The song also says that we must forget some of our egos, forget who comes from where, who goes, or, just let these birds, the hairs of love, take us away.
I wanted the others to also feel this euforical state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: What songs did you make most work?
Zs.B.: In fact, no matter what the musical creation process, we had more difficult songs when we were mixed.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert plan, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove wouldn't work for a long time, and then, small to small, everything was placed as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your preference on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all time with concerts and the fact that I have already "sleep" this disc.
At this time, these are the Prophet is a fool, the escape from the Earth and Never The Same.
The perfid trade of billions because of its complex of inférity
A dissimulator fraud.
Thus, his former employed French gentleman, the General Society, owner of the Czech Bank Commercial Bank.
The bank has lost nearly five billion euros.
But rather than Kerviel is only a big player who wanted to equalize his ecclesiastes, and who, in addition, cannot be considered nothing as incapable.
In contrast to all the large bank houses, he recognised at times the crisis of the American hypothics market.
"It's fragile," they let his superiors hear him who told him to the police.
However, if the deposition of Kerviel reported by the French media, such as The Monde, this man's transactions have resulted in a benefit from 1,6 billion euros last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to win money for my bank," he said in the deposition.
The last age, he was able to benefit from the American crisis to win a half-mild euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to be reported in February, whose hypotheches "sub-prime" were granted to low income clients or to those who had occurred in the past of recovery difficulties would have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the economy's enemy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its benefits are EUR 1,6 billion.
"When I had won my first half-mildard, I didn't know how to announce it," Karviel and Âe said he did not hear anything for himself."
In all the opposers, he admits that he has fainted the reports to not be devised.
He succeeded to dump his superiors, although the Eurex bowl began to interest his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything has nothing
Was he supposed to be covered?
Absolutely not.
"I thought the simple fact that I had obtained 1,6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where's his will to risk so big?
He only reached his post gradually.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after he had completed his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary returned about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trading assistant and in 2005 he became independent with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet, he knew he would never win as much as others.
"From my first entrepreneur in 2005, I knew that I was very less considered than others.
With regard to my university course and my professional and personal parkings, he stated to Kerviel researchers.
However, shortly after his income in function, he delivers his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he wined a half-mile euro by putting this title on the decreases of London's attentials.
And the mechanism was delayed - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you in peace
"There was like a snow-build effect," he said to the police.
But the superiors were at all, or, they doubted about it.
"When I wined, they looked like to close the eyes."
But that's the time it happens at the beginning of the year.
He loses a billion euros on one day.
At mid January, after the weekend, he decides to cover the sum.
On Monday, when he comes to work, he is no longer employed from the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that she lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we discover it?
He became a suspicion because of his congenitors.
"The last year, I took only four days of birth.
A trader that doesn't take vacations is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czech Republic at the opportunity of 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech Government signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the next years, bring 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Czech Courts) to the Czech Republic.
It is nearly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic may be held from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns issued by seven operational programmes will be assigned to the Czech regions.
Czech enterprises will be able to have approximately 100 billion crowns under the enterprise and innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest part of up to 150 billion.
The transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial means that the Czech Rep. may be in the framework of these projects.
This silver will result in an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will take place in the next year a sum of 90.8 billion currencies.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, intended for SMEs and undertakers, has to use financial means to promote innovation within the company.
Undertakings should be financial means for the introduction of news, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new more effective management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic was part of the benefits of the EU funds of the less corroborated successful.
The Court confirmed the penalty of 20 years of prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year prison penalty for the former President of Arnold Germany, which was condemned in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (approximately $1,8 billion).
But later, he was released and was assigned to residence in his face-endda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former leader of this center-American state, depending on 1997 to 2002, will be in prison or not again, according to the AP agency, not for the time.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison agents, or they will leave Germany to finish his penalty with him, or will go back to prison.
4 years ago, the Court proved that Germany regularly moved the government's money to foreign companies accounts in Panama.
It was fitting companies, and the accounts belonged to the members of his family and its nearest partners.
A part of this money went into the funds that Germany had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's it.
The statical budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority of the government without support of opposition.
This year has been spent a year ago, thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - CHSSD, since this is the Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and the CSSD could not allow it.
In contrast to the debate that votes on the defence statement to the Government, this time no dramatic.
The House of Members has adopted this law without any problem, which, despite the most influent, is unnecessary.
That's a kind of paradox.
Let it be seen or not, each chapter and each article constitute the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a part of the policy, even though it is covered behind the concurrence of power against government and opposition.
This last is more attractive in the media, and this is why we give him more attention in the media.
Political disputes are much more interested in the opinion than the abrupt numbers.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments would suffer from three damage that the current budget is not able to regulate at the same time:
The first is the important part granted to the expenditure of mandates imposed by the law, not only by the retraits, but also by social charges, adopted in the last year by the "coalition" of the CSSD and KSCHM parties.
The second is a deficiency economy, the result of the first evil.
The third obstacle, he, is constituted by the deficit of financing, namely by the deficit of cities and communities.
However, this is not the deficit of the statistical budget that represents the largest alinea.
This is relevant and relatively under control.
The true resting bomb is the deficit of cities and communes.
Many employees often made commitments, in turn, with demands of their communities, in order to include money from taxes, tax rights and bank credits, of new sources of investment.
In the past years, they were able to recover these debts by sale in mass of distribution systems, including from the energy obtained by the State in the privatisation.
Today, they don't have this source anymore.
If only the official and verified facts are observed, the following are:
Our economy has passed for several years, just as the rest of the world, a growth phase and the CSSD has not been sold.
It was a unique opportunity for the successful governments of this party to regulate funds.
However, instead of this, they detected the State more.
Other countries, including some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their business in a much more reasonable way than our Republic.
It's a monstrous damn that is mainly renewed to governments.
We are part of countries that at the global level are the least threatened by poverty.
We have therefore no need for massive social programmes that have been, just in recent years, unfortunately, dismissed.
Although we have succeeded to remove a part of the absurd popular expenditure, approved in the last year before elections, if a decline from the age limit for retraite and a reform of the retraite system will not occur next, then any policy will stop existing in this country and whoever will be in power will only be managed.
By exhausting deficiency, political men can be said that they will become officers that will distribute mechanically the majority of the money imposed between retraits and social performances.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes the costs repealed by the costs of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unusual if the governments did not discharge all their money.
If we really don't want the power policies to become simple bureaucrates, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only cost the equivalent of what happens to be imposed in tax and tax rights, the calm needed for the preparation of new reform laws.
There are only those who will enable progressively to achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to regulate the crisis
The United States Federal Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swedish and Canadian Central Bank decided to fight the crisis of financial markets.
More than 100 billion dollars will be placed on monetary markets through business.
It will handle banks to sell, by a business system, the interest rates to which they are ready to pay money.
For example, the American Fed will send 40 billion dollars to businesses and will also provide 24 billion to the European Central and Switzerland Banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action to this concerted point, to prevent or even reduce the impact of the financial crisis.
"This approach aims to resolve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capitals that banks could provide," wrote in his report to Bernard Baumohl clients of the Economic Outlook Group Advisory Society.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the probability of a receipt in the United States of 65 per cent to approximately 50 per cent," she reported.
The banks have already lost $60 billion because of unresolved loans, especially in the United States.
Analystes are still expecting other losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, it is that they must really learn what can still be followed," said the economicist of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"The situation seems really bad," he says.
The Central Banks are afraid that if their own banks have difficult access to the loans, they will make their customers more friendly.
This would decrease consumption and reduce the US economy in a recession that could affect the growth of the world.
The Central Banks did this choice after the interbancation rate of London, called LIBOR, had not been able to decrease.
This means that the banks were always fearing the mutual loans, despite the American, Canadian and English Central Banks had decreased their interest rates at several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a new reduction of interest rates," he said to the Agency Re日s Greg Salvaggio of the Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of the Central Banks will not contribute to the crisis because it does not regulate the main problem that is the loss of the immobile market in the United States.
President Klaus: The debates of the →logists are incredible
Global climate changes must be weak, especially in developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has again spoken about the problem of the planework.
This time, the criticism has been disrupted on the United Nations International Conference on climate changes in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, pointed out that the debates of the Âlogists were incredible.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, which constitutes an interesting mixture of representatives of non-governmental governments and organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying and reality.
"The debate is not at all, it is only a word range, replaced by the solutions to the current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject has a great importance for him, and therefore he commits so much to this cause.
He also showed satisfaction in what his book also appears in German translation, since he said, "I often meet only the loading of my opinions."
Now, interested people can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although it is not climate, however, he has enough provisions to edit such a book.
It is actually an academic who can follow and appreciate scientific treaties, has statistical practice and is also economicist.
The major conclusions of the book, according to him, are the following: the evolution of climate without stop, therefore the changes of it are normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on the planetarian recovery, the effects of the current changes are not too important or too serious, therefore they represent no danger, and, finally, the efforts to influence climate development are unusual, ineffective and inacceptable.
In addition to the experience of a totalitary regime, he considers that it is unacceptable to introduce inversible opinions to others, which it feels as a dangerous impact on freedom.
In response to the issues of the present persons, he explained several times that it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment but against an integral environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefit they have".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people did not renew their permission to conduct in time
Six hundred thousand leaders left the time and did not renew their older permit to conduct which the validity comes to the end of the year.
We are the last day people can still ask for renewment, so the authorities will be in the way of delivering them a new licence before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permission will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their authorisation to conduct, especially those who do not want to conduct anymore.
While the communities report a loss of the number of requests for renewment of authorisation, the authorities in the capital are subject to requests and the number of requests for renewal of licence has increased this week.
Marie satisfies about 2000 clients per day.
There's a half hour ago.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO leaders have not yet renewed their right to drive.
The release of a new licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery for a short time of five days.
In this case, the driver pays a addition of five hundred coroners.
The vehicle drivers who will not succeed in renewaling the licence to carry out the end of the year and we will take the road without a valid permission, will risk, since January, an amendment.
The guilty will be forced to pay two thousand currencies at the maximum.
However, the police officer can also treat the infringement with a friendly approach.
In the case of a administrative crime, the amendment to 2500 coroners.
According to ancient information, it was likely that even a person would not be able to make it.
It could be restricted to pay up to 30,000 coroners.
The Minister had invited the authorities to moderate and to impose amendments not exceeding 1000 hours.
However, according to the portfolio of the Karel Hanzelka Transport Minister, no one is able to rise in tens of thousands.
The authorisation of conduct constitutes a document that people may decide whether they want or not.
It is not like the identity card which, it, must be valid without exceptions.
People who do not want to lead anymore should give their right to conduct.
It is sufficient to bring or send it to the corresponding municipality.
The licence to be delivered between 1964 and 1993 will not be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also required to gradually renew other types of vehicle authorisation.
The persons held in documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years in order to renew.
The validity of the licences of conduct delivered in 2001 to 2004 is expired in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2,6 million other documents.
The Court reduced the penalties of detectives pacted with Berdych
Joseph Opava and Peter Koňarik, ancient police officers accused of conviction with David Berdych's gang, will be held 30 years of prison respectively.
The High Court of Prague has thus definitively condemned them by decreasing their penalties from 1 and 2 years respectively.
In the original case, the Department's detectives for the fight against organised crime risked 14 and 12 years of prison.
It is no longer possible to call against the today's sentence, but only one call to the Supreme Court is intended.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, it is only the first instancy verdict.
However, he has already received in other proceedings of penalties whose sum exceeds 16 years of prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court recognised the responsibility for the participation of 19 persons in holding, and the High Court today negotiated the interviews of 16 of them.
The majority of the accused ones, since the beginning of the investigation, made the accusation in question by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement between others with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources, covered the different hold-ups and helped members of the gang to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 per cent of the larcin in Opava and Koňarik.
In the accusation it is questioned of the criminal activity of the gang in 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed flights whose victims, in most cases, have been seriously affected by health, but also by the abuse of power of a public agent and armed agent.
In case of households, the police actually discovered illegally detained guns, obuses with a acetic node, a dressing for the direct trail of laser or a mitraillette.
According to the reports, the gang was rich in tens of millions of coronas.
On the other hand, nearly twenty men of this proceeding, the courts have already repeated other flights up to Berdych and a series of other people.
Other men of Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining before the court in another proceeding, some cases have not yet come to the court.
The main audience for the moment prevented Tomás Pota and Maroš Schulej who are currently in prison in Ireland, where they expect the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
Children's substitution price: 12 million
Igor Veleba's lawyer wants a 12 million couronnes more than expenditure from Trébič's hospital.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the hospital lawyer Ondréj Dostál does not agree with Veleba's proposal.
"We make such a refund, this is very high," Dostal said at the outcome of the audience.
"To be an opinion on the contraproposite, we need the report of experts which the side-in-law has commanded.
We'll check if this is a explaining value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostal highlighted.
The amount should, accordingly, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family asked a million crowns for each month where she could not lift up her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, published for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a document supported for deductation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatric experts, parents have suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they had been confronted with the refunds that they did not have to prevent the substitution of newborn.
Women, they remain less severe in front of the current traumatism and in front of what is currently happening, summarized the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by last 9 December at Trebic hospital.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Chermák in Pribysla and Veronica at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloňov.
The Governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčich, finally October, has sent to each of the families 100 000 coroners for the refund of the expenditures of the Tribič Hospital errored by the region.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are charged by the civil responsibility law.
In the case of deficiency, they must be in the reserve fund, exclusively, they may ask for aid to the manager.
To this end, the courts had relatively small damage, the amounts calculated according to the tables were of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polygon and perdue of the Valaş Kingdom (le Kingdom de Valašsko)
Polívka and perdue only litige au subject de la marque de Valašská kingdom (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Regional Court of Ostrava, it was actually the one who used the Roi de Valašsko for the first time, but the project was put on the team around Tomás Harabiš, the former actor's team.
Polivka was not present today's audience.
But his lawyer, the case is probably not finished and his client will call.
"The litige refers to the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites on Bolek Polívka's popularity," the lawyer of Polívka said after the procedure.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valašsko devote just this actor and comic to everyone.
Harabish is the same opinion.
"There is a work of almost ten years behind us.
The search for money and the setting of events" said.
He says that it's the money that's the cause of the litigation.
"In years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit it.
They are those who want to parasite our work," he said.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used for the first time the Valašski king (Roi de Valašsko) in its television emission.
Actor Radoslav Brzzobohati had a coronary king in 1993.
However, at the time, it was not related to the project to put up a fixed kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came with the idea of bringing passports of the Valašské Kingdom.
From a humanitarian action on the origin, a business and a lucrative commercial activity followed by the creation, by Harabish, of the Valašské Kingdom society.
In 1997, Polívka accepted its name and signature to be cited in the past and even offered to the loans holders on the price of the visit of its closure and the theatre spectacles.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the Court also mentioned that Harabisch has only made use of the new idea, which is used by Polívka in the management emission for commercial purposes.
"The popularity de Boleslav Polívka is probably aided le Valash Kingdom project," said la South.
However, she concluded that the project was constituted by Harabish and its team which would intensely be dedicated to the project.
The enemies of today continued until 2000 when Harabish organized a official coordination in Vsetine for Polívka.
But from there, conflicts started to concurrence between Polívka and Harabish, who have covered the deposition " King Boleslav 1 chosen forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then under the inspiration of Harabish, taken by the song Jarmila Schuláková as a mother of Reine.
Then, in 2002, Polívka made a complaint against Harabiš and his company, requesting that the court has been rejected today.
What could take the case is the tournoi intended for the throne and half of the princess.
He should get out of it a new king.
He didn't want to track the details and date yet.
"We don't want to go quickly.
It would be something like the defiled kings in Slovakko.
The king would be chosen for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polívka is obviously inscribed," Harabish said.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: loss of prejudice
In fact, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
His rolling qualitys were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, conduct and also the quality of the manufacture could, in many ways, be qualified from lower than the average.
However, on the market it is currently on its follower Peugeot 207 which, she, is just better.
As long as the SW-named combi goes still far away, it's not more than thinking better.
When I tested the classic hachback of Peugeot 207, for example, I was worried about the space for the head on the behind seats.
While there you end the claims because the carrossery means that even the big devils will be in this regard.
Let's see it quickly done.
I'm gonna call the inside very quickly so that I'm not too repeated.
This is a nearly successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that looks poor to me.
There, I would have loved a design a little more inventive, as the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could be plagued of seats or too short documents is revolutionated.
The side guide has also been clearly improved in relation to model 206.
As regards the space, carrosery dimensions are also sensitive there.
The combi also sees to disappear the lack of place above the already mentioned head.
A coffre in the coffre
The most important of this vehicle, therefore, is his baggage support.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (along with the back pivot ice) and a rather easily arrimage.
Small spaces are associated with elastic stops that constitute a perfect compromise.
It is not covered and can be extended while it can be able to hold enough bad objects.
But let's stop the volume.
This makes, in the tables, 428 l in the base configuration, which is compared to the competition an average number.
On the other hand, Schkoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czechland.
If it is compared to 207 SW with the new generation of Mr Boleslav product, it is found that Peugeot remains very sensitive behind, and the difference is 52 litres.
When it's about to go to the foreign or to load a powder, this number is almost critical.
But if I had to make the benefits, I would mention the remaining box layer after reversing the records of the backsites perfectly right, or well a very low walkpied.
120 horses distributed on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a Otto motor of four cylindres with a volume of 1,6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, this is what a 1,6 thing should be that makes a family haachback walk.
He's quiet, consuming little, and, especially, he's pulling well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Schkoda that often gives the impression of having a pot of exhaust broken by a serpent, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's park the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not limited to all.
However, we must have aware that we have tested a very well equipped car with a spacious inside and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1,4 litres up to 329 900 Kč is still driftable.
The vehicle we tested cost from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
But we have had more headbags, automatic climate, automatic glass tests, automatic command of back windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
It's much, but try to acquire the additional equipment at Fabia price and you'll get a very similar number.
It is therefore only to choose the mark.
The integration of the Slovaks in the British schools is wrong
The number of children originating in East European countries in the British schools is growing, which results in the remaining concerns about the development of local education.
The integration of the Europeans is, in the meantime, to a series of obstacles.
British schools even find out cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the people of origin are transformed into violence.
The case of the North Kent, which begins to focus on remaining and immigrated conflicts from Slovakia, illustrates well the problem of integration of children originating in East Europe.
Discussions, chicane and bathroom between → have been translated into the relationships between parents.
The situation has gone so far that the police stopped Chatham a Slovak woman who struck with a rail bar of 10 years.
The guilt is defended by claiming that the boy was injured by racism matters.
The police also had to intervene after the attack against a Slovak inmigred of two teenagers.
Young girls had previously addressed this man with racist comments and cut down stones to him.
"When we returned home, a young man gripped on the bus stop and started breaking on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by pomps and pockets and then opened his feet," a new unfair adventure described a Slovak mother.
The complaints are formulated by the two parties.
One of the residents has gone to qualify conflicts with immigrants for the survival.
The higher cases show that the atmosphere in the British schools between the people of origin and the immigrants begins to be tendered.
70 thousand Slovaks come to find work are recorded in Great Britain.
And approximately 30 thousand Slovaks often frequent British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your congey can realize if you make a good choice.
Dormouse and white beaches like snow, high waves, or then a calm sea like a snow.
Palms and all included with servers offering you a pizza, ice or many increasing cocktails on the beach.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the Caribbean Islands, you will not find this list only in its integrity, but enrichion.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the biggest and beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was the bassion of their invasion in America.
Christophe Colomb qualified her as the best place that human eye has never seen.
Havana became the depth and the place of transbording the treasures that the Spanish have stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American Year.
The National Hotel was held at the beginning of the 20th.
This is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who made it build, because everything that was a crime in the United States (only under the Property) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, hazard games, prostitution.
Among his clients, there was, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Hawaii, increasing immutables moved and cars, belonging to the symbols of worship in the last 50th century, were on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, near Havana, and, in Coyemar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and the political men of the entire America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of la Havana.
In the National Hotel Bar, a luxe hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these worshipping cars have always been in Havana, since the jigoules and jads imported have already been a long time, in such a salted and humid climate, perri.
Although Hawan, especially the oldest part, or sensitively decrept, there are nowhere else in the neighborhood, there are so many splendid colonial monuments that there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
In the past fifty years, new hotels have moved not only to Havana, but especially to Varader, at the coast of Holguin, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and which will be appreciated especially by small train amateurs.
The canon was returned from the plants spread in sugars on a stretched road by small vapor and motor trains.
Their roulant mother has not been renewed for decades and so it can be seen in the way of small lomotives whose contemporary ones are not only in museums.
Where to lead his steps?
Most visitors do not miss the most places with.
So there is no need to write it long on Varadero or well on Havana.
Notwithstanding that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that who loves this writer should not break the visit.
The valley of Viňales on the west of the island is one of the most pittoresc angles of Cuba.
A exhaustive vegetation and pulses on a calcium ground.
Mootes, calcium balls and rocks are coming into the cycle of the valley's background, and, from the fruity land is taken into their entrances, even its rocks are covered by a very deep vegetal cup.
The valley is the place where we probably cultivate the cuban tobacco of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the Havan cigarettes manufacturers.
Someone may also find interesting that it is that when the Chile episode was turned from the Zeman Chilean episode.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded a little while after the Spanish had colonized the island.
This is the market for the trade of slaves and the sugar that brought him glory and richness.
The riches were incarnated in the beautifulness and the city-vitrine character of this town's decreased size.
The colonial Spanish characteristics, extremely affected by the French major staff, have not changed within four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Mount Mountain Escambray, is a place in such a place at the art that was about in the last 50th century, there was no way to connect this region to the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the side.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolize anything, everyone was pleased to have a tooth above the head.
If there is more time in Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth seeing interesting places around, such as playa Ancón or the Valley of Sucreries.
Then, the night, it's costume to go to the Music House who's angry after the sun's sleep and where the music's sorrows only at the morning.
Baracoa
Some design this bourgade to the extreme east of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is probably already influenced by the way that leads there.
The two roads that go from Guantánamo have to go out of high and accidental mountains and have a nearly without marks of the activity hum.
UNESCO recorded the East East of Cuba, through its intact landing, on the list of the world inheritance.
There is the best chocolate, in the church, there is Christophe Colomb's cross (in fact, she has seen the day nearly hundred years after the Columbus Periphe) and from the mountain where the ancient chateau-fort and the current hotel El Castillo, there are several table mountains, with the most famous one is El Yunque.
About the coffee, the rhum, the cigarettes, the mountain Massif Sierra Maestra, the Baie des Truies and the Pinos Island, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the holy patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the seeds of the elderly slaves, could be filled with a number of pages.
Just as we just say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the alliances are strict, the Americans say
The lack of soldiers and equipment needed, the United States, affects the deployment of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Defense Minister Robert Gates, the NATO should make a concrete plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not work as it should, and the representatives of the countries who have groups in the Southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh.
Along with the growing contest of the Taliban movement, the eight involved states today also discuss future plans and alliations.
While the United States called this week by the Defense Minister Robert Gates to the NATO groups to a greater activity, Great Britain views as a priority the strengthening of the Government of Afghanistan and the intensification of development assistance.
"The development in Afghanistan is perceived, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow people to start a new development of economy and security," the BBC chain said the British Defense Minister des Browne.
Four-twenty-dix per cent
The activity of the Afghanistan inspectors is the most intense data of the American Army in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent in comparison to the past year, up to 60 per cent in the province of Helmand, South of the country.
The NATO countries have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, with nearly a quarter in the South.
The United States, however, have reached their absolute limits and in the organization and in the equity of the groups.
In particular, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of the Afghanistan groups.
"We should consider seriously concrete objectives for the future period, as well as how to achieve them," said Gates.
The Secretary-General of the OTAN Jaap de Hoop has today made similar issues.
"I am not pleased with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have approximately fourteen per cent of the soldiers and the equipment we would need, and that is not enough," De Hoop said to the Re-Agency at the end of the speakers with the Japanese Government in Tokyo who would last three days.
Who's strict?
These last months also rule between the countries involved in conflicts on the question if all aliens are effectively in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its viability.
"The Germans have a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are involved in areas where violence is minimum, the needs of combating them are therefore not as strong as those in the South and East countries of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British Sun tabloid has qualified the German soldiers of persecutors this week.
"The Afghanistan fairs discovered: Germans play, while our fighters," Sun wrote in a document completed by photos of German soldiers playing in the table tennis.
The German Newspaper Image passed to the attack by photographing a British group during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The State's debt will be billion in 2009
The charge of a debt of the State exceeding 84,000 corones is covered by each Czech Republic.
The total debt has been mounted, finally September, to 842,7 billion crowns.
The Government had planned to take up 159,2 billion currencies this year.
Thanks to the development of the economy of the best State budget as provided, the Minister decreased the amount of 152,8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is to the end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.
Thus, in the nine months of this year, he increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June, he decreased from 13,4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the debt of the State from the beginning of October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84.000 corones is covered by each Czech.
The State was over 111 billion crowns in the past year.
"Instead, it seems that, through a less important deficit for the next year, a billion crowns could be exceeded only in 2009.
The next year, the debt should take place between 900 billion and a billion corones," said the Patria Finance David Marek analyst for the iHNed.cz server.
The prospect of Next Finance Vladimir Pikor's analysis is similar: "We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene changed, that policy was ready to economy more, the date could be repeated in 2010.
But I don't have this change," he said.
The debts grow
The State's debt is constituted by the debt of the Central Government and is mainly born by the accumulation of the deficits of the State budget.
The State's debt is financed by goods of the treasury, rental licences, direct loans or, for example, by contributions to the European Investment Bank.
The State's internal commitment has increased this year for 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt of the State has increased this year for 1,7 billion coroners to 123,3 billion corones.
The debt of the State called negotiable has reached at the end of September 803,3 billion coroners and has reduced 13,7 billion crowns from June.
The average requirement of State debt has increased to 6,5 years.
"The total debt has increased interannually from the first to the third half of 13 per cent, which is, taking into account the current health of the economy, a very high number.
It is interesting that growth is generated in particular by the rental tickets where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt believes, but, on the other hand, it indicates that there will be a matter to negotiate when the reform of the retraits comes," said the Pikora data.
Better than what we expected
It was therefore the financing and management strategy of the State debt for 2007 that the Government had planned to impose 159,2 billion corones this year.
At the beginning of September, the Minister had reduced the amount of 152,8 billion currencies through the economy development of the State budget.
The sum is mainly constituted by the deficit of the State budget, which is evidently reaching 76 billion currencies this year, instead of 91.3 billion initially scheduled coronas.
It is, then, the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, 13,3 billion currencies, the 10 billion reserve for the remuneration of retraits, the financing of state income licences for 43 billion currencies and the rebounds of the European Investment Bank.
She compared today before a court in Khartoum for named a worm
The British teacher judged in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced on Thursday night by a court of Khartoum at 15 days of prison and on exil, indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused to have left 6 to 7 years of age to give the name of Mahomet to a worst in the worst, while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was passible with a peak of fucking cuts.
This British Institute of 54 years depending on the University High School of Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday with her and invoked to the Islam and the Sediment, pursuant to Article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Code, following several complaints of parents in the Sudan Education Ministry.
The story actually comes back in September, when this teacher asks for his ≥ 6/7 years of age to choose a name for the weight of the class.
“Hey names come out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says the director of Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children of 23 chose Mohamed as a preferred name.
Mohamed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Soudan.
Children then performed a book for the class with the photo of the ear followed by the “My name is Mohamed”.
The mouth himself did not bring any label with that name, but the problem is just the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to the islam.
One of the Muslims of Gieuan Gibbons, teacher in the same school in Soudan, indicated that he knew her well and that she had never done anything that could be injured against a religious faith, “I just sorry that she asked the children to vote for a name”, it is he only as a “ innocent error”.
Reviews shared by many institutions who describe it as “very careful towards its →s” and “never speaking of religion in class”.
Let us note that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by the Muslim family is a way to honor the prophet (is given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a game?
It is certainly a question of interpretation.
They did not come to a agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiations meeting in Vienna.
Finally, I failed.
The Serbians and the Albanians of Kosovo ended Thursday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without overcoming their differences on the future status of the separate province.
“It is regretable that the parties had not been able to reach a statutory agreement” said the European Mediator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
Underlineing that peace in the region was "in play", his American authorised, Frank Wisner, encouraged them to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“We do not prevail violence in the middle but we are going in a very difficult period”, he said, “becoming evident tensions”.
End of the mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troyka, who re-group the European Union, the United States and Russia, will become last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90 per cent of Albanophones could become more sensitive when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will report to the United Nations Security Council, from 10 December.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika was loaded from a new mediation by the United Nations in the last century.
Americans and Europeans believed that their mediation would be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the authorisation of independence to Kosovo, have insisted on a continuation of negotiations beyond that date.
“The Russia was and remained engaged in a negotiated solution, a compromise solution” said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
Following eight years of Kosovo's Onusian administration, the Octuals believe that the EU's independence is the only sustainable solution.
Pristina is ready to proclaim it in a single way if the Security Council is not in its favour.
It insists on an increased autonomy.
“Freely, no agreement has been found” announced by the President of the Kosovo autonomous authority, Fat日 Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel, where these “the last chance negotiations were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, ancient commander of the Cosovare rebellion and the future Prime Minister of the province, was a part of his regrets.
However, he said that the autonomy plan presented by hraned “pertained to a past that led to murders and deportations”.
‘Domain Effect’
The Serbian President Boris Tadic estimated that a compromise was always intended, maintaining the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a single-terral declaration of the independence of the province.
In particular, it states a "dominio effect" in a region still fragilized by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
“For Serbia, said he, that does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On March, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision would return to the Security Council, where its Russian union has a veto right.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word”
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia” said the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“These negotiations have been due to two years.
They must end as they started: to the Security Council."
For journalists, Fat日 Sedjiu had answered that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status”, which implies that any unilateral statement of independence from the Albanian would be “in concertation” with the O©aux.
Bush concludes an agreement between Israel and Palestinian
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference by its Monday care at Maryland, that the Israelites and the Palestinians were finally agreed on a common statement.
He stated that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were heard to immediately engage negotiations to find a definitive regulation of 60-year-old content between their two peoples.
In the presence of two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "Peace Treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must demanter "the terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its colonization activities, said Bush, reminding both parties of their obligations regarding the "Road Fee" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House highlighted that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, presided by Abbas, would indicate "to conclude a peace treaty which solve all issues in suspension, without exception, including central issues".
This call covers the three emergency problems in the heart of the contentious between Israel and Palestinian: the future borders of the Palestinian, the statue of Jerusalem and the extent of the Arabic repositories expired from their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the conflict of 1948.
By taking the word after the American President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and deployed" and have on all aspects of a regulation, quoting "Jerusalem, re-reserved, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
On its turn to the court, Olmert committed the future talkers to be "direct and continuous" and "a efforts to buckle them in the 2008 corner".
Bush fixed at the end of 2008 the time of the implementation of its "visibility of two Palestinian and Israeli states" which co-existence.
The Saudi Arabia revealed that she had received a commitment in this sense of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
The Arabia, whose participation in Police is a success for Washington, is from the origin of a plan, endowed by all Arab countries, which proposes to Israel peace in exchange of his return from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including Jerusalem-East.
Polis marks "a carrier in the story of the Middle East, especially because he attacks the racines of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saoud considers in his interview in the Saudi Arabic Capital day.
The police are not responsible for seeking it.
What exactly happened, Sunday?
As each time in this different type of fact, official versions and sounds are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the ae?
According to the first elements of the General Police Inspection (IGPN), a police car was on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
“It was not in intervention but in patrol, and it was 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare,” explains a police source.
A green motor from the Kawazaki mark, "not approved, therefore not authorised to hold on the road" (read below) and piloted by two youths without casks, was "in a very living way".
“He has gained the police car on the left, after a priority to the right”, states a police officer.
The control of alcoholism on vehicle employees was negative.
The state of the car (pre-declined, star-brise, shocked parchocs) shows the violence of choc.
Very quickly, yesterday, the search of the Pontoise Republic, Marie-Thérere de Givry, announced to have granted an investigation for “involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger” to the IGPN, with the Departmental District of the Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at the time of a press conference, the request stated that the IGPN request, at that stage, was separated from the responsibility of police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of aa, hearing Sunday evening, confirmed “the version of the police, meaning that this mini-moto has reached relatively quickly on their left”.
Yesterday, a kind of rain, uncertainly caused by the flooring of the pool-pieds on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were completed as long as the car of the police could be driven.
The vehicles have been inserted and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims have been autopsed yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a voice was quick in Villiers-le-Bel, which police would have quit very quickly, without providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, however, would also separate “all serious errors” in relation to this point.
“This is a aspect of the most difficult question, which needs more research, on which it must be very difficult”, a police source stated.
Libération met a ocular witness of these instants who followed the a.
One of his windows give exactly on the scene.
“We're soon down, with my cousin who's at the hospital, to try to ranim them, the witness is.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw “a completely hazard policeman who was drinking.
Two others were trying to reanimate one of the young ones, the fourth talked on the phone."
In view of the pressure that quickly surrounded the scene, and, in fact, of the certainty that the people in the unexpected situation of young people had been carried out by the police in cars arrived on the places.
This testimony always comes to the springs "once twenty minutes after the police's department".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
"I will not say that police services have not been helped to young people.
These young people have been secure.
The pumpers arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them”, highlighted the search from her side.
The pressure ascends to Pakistan
The Pakistanian police repeated the first manifestations from the establishment of the emergency state two days ago by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, on the east of the country, approximately 2.000 lawyers who demonstrated the measures taken in the context of the emergency status were hurt by the lacrymogen greeds used by the order forces, witnesses.
These recently replaced by stones of stones, hurting police.
At least 350 lawyers have been interpelled.
Similar scenarios like Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police were charged and wounded by lawyers.
Many would have been interpolated.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's Barrier called to a general greeve and announced manifestations, after a vague of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, military human rights and lawyers.
The streets of access to the Supreme Court were locked on Monday morning to prevent race.
Other manifestations would have occurred in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The movement of the lawyers gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties in the powerful covenant Muttahida-e-Amal, which the President encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who spoke against the status of urgency and detrites to those who had made the promise before Musharraf.
'The promise of Musharraf doesn't keep anymore'

More than one third of the largest remains unpredicted
This calculation takes into account the unnecessary gravity (24 %) and the badly planned or unpredicted births.
Today, more than three (36 %) gravity is not expected today, a study conducted by the National Demography Studies Institute (Ined), 40 years after the vote of the Neuvirth Act, which liberalized the contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account the unnecessary gravity (24 %) and the badly planned or unpredicted births.
The different contraception methods such as pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates the Ined.
Liberalisation of the contraception is likewise allowed to be better "ficondity manager", the Institute notes that the rate of use of the pill for women from 20 to 44 years has exceeded from 5 % in 1970 to 60 % today.
Finally, eight years of ten would be well planned today.
See calculated at nearly month for a couple of five and if possible at the pre-case, the season is judged as the most pleasant for a child.
Spectacular reparation on the space station
There will be more than seven hours of work in the astronaute Scott Parazynski and its international space station team friends (ISS) to perform the spectacular reparation of a solar panel, which is essential to follow the scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that accompanied records of the fact of its duration, from its distance from its habitated modules, from the speed it was imagined, of astronautes 'brickled' tools to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Thursday while the astronautes had downloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery ship, a large cylindric part loaded to receive the European and Japanese scientific workshops soon (see frame).
This module is a type of appointment chain for the lab modules.
But it must be able to provide them in election.
The second task of the team was, therefore, to move a module for the production of election by solar panels weighting 17,5 tonnes, already present on the ISS to put it on its final position.
After it was moved, the team started re-eploying the solar panels of the module with an envelope of 76 metres.
And there is one of the panels, which spreads as granted, was damaged at nearly one meter by a cab that fell down.
The deployment was stopped so that the panel would not be worried anymore.
The astronautes, which originally perform a control output from the Discovery ship, then go to prepare another solar panel with the rotation system was defective, have seen obliged to dedicate themselves to the damageed panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to be characterized at the bottom of 30 meters of the telecommanded arm of the ship that was used at the station to perform the repair.
It's one of the best spacewalkers of Nasa.
Great, resident, very awesome, he has the very developed tower and long arms.
At 46 years, this training doctor was therefore loaded to "operate" the solar panel "founded".
Following precise inspection of the deficiency, he separated the fault calf and installed types of "attels" on the damageed area.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" staying near his and, inside, by the other astronautes including Peggy Whitson, the commander of the team.
The tool that he used, a mini-cocky channel developed by isolating to avoid the electrocution on the solar panels produced several hundred grade volts, was designed and "brickled" by the astronautes at the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely deployed before making the inventory of its tools and restarting the station.
Last night, the astronautes benefited from a half-day detention before today, seven astronautes don't repeat the Discovery ship for a return to the Planned Earth on Thursday.
The title of EADS sanctions in Bourse
The EADS action is currently low at Paris's beach, after the airport and defence group announced that it would have to cost between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros to face the A400M delays.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Bourse.
The Group was required to review its operational performance for 2007 after the late progress of the development of the A400M engine, which consists of the aircraft's insurance flight.
The cost to cover the loss taken in the delivery of military transport aircraft, announced in October, has been numbered '1.2 to 1.4 billion euros with more than 1 billion for Airbus',' announced the European EADS' mother house.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be binding to announce new exploitation result targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its next trimestrial results on Thursday, without further encrypted precisions.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new charges is coherent with six months late.
For memory, the operational result of EADS has fallen from 86% in 2006, mainly because of charges related to the losses of another programme, the very big portor A380.
Initially, the Group provided a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension, on Sunday, on the outcome of urnes: the Russians will have a massive option for the party of President Poutine, the United Russia.
They convince their appreciation to stability, even to the mass, after a very locked campaign.
In three days of the Islative Elections, Russian President Vladimir Poutine addresses the electors today a television message on the chains, already recorded but whose content is stored secretly.
He makes it as a group of Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is pro-Kremlin.
Yesterday, the President has not allowed it to transparency by receiving the foreign ambassadors, who are pleased to deliver a new charge against the OÂ accused of inheritance - its prediling theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest elections, the most transparent and the most open, without accrocs," he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, we're far from the account.
It refers to a campaign of pressure.
The leader of Guennadi Ziouganov says that there were "never had any elections like sales, even at the time of Eltsine".
After the repression of the most recent weekend manifestations, the former campion of the disaster world Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days of prison for illegal manifestation, remains prohibited of visiting his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet man"
After these unsuspensional isolations, two more open issues are:
- Who will happen to Poutine at the presidential?
The Official Journal held the date of the first tour of the Chairman on 2 March 2008; the candidates have to be informed until 23 December.
In 2000 and in 2004, Vladimir Poutine could not take a third consequent mandate.
Or none of the followers are throwing.
- What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the majority of the parliamentary and all the powerful Russian parties who would choose the Government and the President?
Anyway, the islatives and the president, the power outside triomphera.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Soviet man, they do not feel masters of their destination," demands the sociolog Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
History Nikolai Kopossov, of the St. Petersbourg State University, is far off: the civil society has taken a delay in this Christianized country for five centuries after Europe; the ambiguous Community spirit has endured the training of individualism.
According to the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Poutine renewed with the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population as far as this new patriarch was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic approach,” Mary Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “reject the personal responsibility” which they had recently proved after the URSS location.
“What is good to think?”
The phénomène touches all social beds, including the world of business.
And the administrative elite means preserving the status quo: 65 governments (of 85 Russian leaders) lead the United Russian local lists.
The newly imported freedoms from O′ are often synonymous of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of which the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, Professor of 54 years: “What is good to think?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why do you change them? ”
A Memory Hard
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which retrace the destinations of 17,5 million victims of hitlery regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archive documents, contained by 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were only advisable for a "humanian purpose", which is individually and nominally, on request of an ancient victim or its rights.
On May 2006, the eleven States supported their management - give Germany, France, Israel, and the United States agreed to open them to researchers and historicals.
The ratification process of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access to historicals to Bad Arolsen will be allowed to investigate “in particular on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health of the forced workers”, explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Croix-Rouge Committee (CCR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening of these nominative documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain deportation victims.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest mandates established by the Gestapo were collected after war in a practical scope: finding the civilians deported or subjected to the obligational work and, possibly, bringing them a evidence of their internal in order to open the road to their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent salaries have tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is a limited interest.
"There is nothing new to wait for these documents," said Prince Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Antizemitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want to reach a free exchange agreement in 2008
Currently, the indo-European bilateral trade has already reached approximately 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is the first commercial partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, indicated the European Commissioner in Commerce Peter Mandelson and its Indian approval, Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Affairs Ministers had last April given their green fire to the European Commission to engage negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South East Asia (Asean).

The EU is the first commercial partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the nineth trade partner of the EU, the numbers of the European Commission.
"A free exchange package works extremely to both economys" and "Inde would improve its access to a market of 450 million prospected Europeans," Peter Mandelson justified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, specificated by the European Commissioner. The Asian and European agents exchange annually for "47 billion euros" and "10 billion euros of services", said that this week, Daniele ́Adja, head of the European Commission's delegation to New Delhi, was aware that the bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India are vended for their eighth diplomatic summet in New Delhi, in the presence of the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

UMP and NC’s review of PS proposals on the purchase power
The UMP groups and the New Centre held Thursday to discuss articles of the proposal of socialist law on purchasing power, which was based on a rejection of the text.
Included in a "socialist" (the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined from a declaration of measures adopted on Monday by the national PS office among which the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the restoration of TIPP, a cheque-transport or the labour framework.

Following many sounds about creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelowe, the promotor/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival at New Jersey, in partnership with the British Republic of Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it is a honour to work with a person who has, not even at least, inspired the current movement of festivals in America”, gave Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the festival Lollapalooza of Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a steady destination for the camping.
The festival should be held between 8 and 10 to 10 on a private closure of 500 acres at approximately 40 minutes of Philadelhalte.
In the name of Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the reading Festival bar in the United Kingdom, which annually attracted about 80 000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn embraced the Leeds Festival at his portfolio, then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Festival Latitude of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been loaded from the production, the concession of licences and organizational tasks of Glasstonbury Festival, which can now receive up to 177 500 people.

Unfortunately, we have been involved in politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
“Happy, we could talk to Melvin Benn and we are ready to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will last serve the people of Philadelowe.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park of Chicago, after they had entered the festival landing in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events were recorded from $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the middle of the city.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a field festival, while ours are located in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge the two forms, in a way or other, to give an impression of festival campaign to Europe and the city to the American."
Vineland is nearly near the middle road between Philadelowe and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the maire, supports this event with enthusiasm,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter is to reveal the conditions of the hearing, but it states: “They are quite interesting to allow investment in such a event and to receive a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life.”
Charlie Jones says that the ability to take this festival is "very big", in the case of that of 80 000 people from the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were made to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of pressure.

Montréal faces the Terminator
It is not easy to attach Hollywood film plates to Montreal when no other than Terminator is opposed...
This mission of deduction is part of the functions of the delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, refers to "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the ‘Governator’ patts?
"The industry must be able to decide where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,” he says.
The course to the festivals
However, the priority of Denis Turcotte is the promotion of the film here.
The course in Oscars has been started.
It will be of all the festivals of the West Côte, whether it is the Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco festivals, who are questioned to present the Quebeco films, to value them and to ensure that the performers do interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful vitrine at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is at the office in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short meters to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-year-end rally? The experts divided by the sub-premium crisis.
Within less than five weeks of the year closure, investors already strike their hands by waiting for the traditional end-year-year-based array.
However, this year, experts are not even sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that " from the statistical view, the December ' s breakdown month has usually a positive behavior.
However, it is not necessary to make previsions based on statistics, since, as the current context, uncertainty is at the markets at least on the short term. "
Although they are not partial to take the bulb for the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the bulb market is fed by the existence of liquidity, which is intended to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the efficacy of escape to quality values both in the long periods and in the short periods".
For this reason, they believe that the bubble will have a behavior instead sideless, not free of volatilities "saturally because we do not know the impact of the low rate of the Fed, since the high level of the brute and the risk of stimulating inflationist pressures"
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI wins in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"This is not the best thing," the expert assures.
Ibex, Spanish bossier, has lost nearly 4 % since 8 November when the Ibex was locked at 15.945,7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, Analysis of Intermoney, believes Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolio and traditional contributions to the retraite regimes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert notes that things will be a little different this year, since he believes that the rallye will occur from the second week of December, after the festival of the Constitution (on 6 December).
The analysis does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an Analysis of Inversis Banco, assesses that we are near technical levels, and "that is why we can observe an increase in the index that could be caused in accordance with information from the European Union on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum cottons.
Solana, of Intermoney, states "This year the big values are returning to him."
The expert would include the two large banks and some builders "for when the date is approached, the electrical sector will be very sweet."
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banko, the increases will be from the bank and the industry sector.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, in the case they put it.
"Acs has recovered positions for several months and we hope that other constructors such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same way," explains the expert.
The cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the wines in the Christmas wines season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the companies will do it so well, even though there is no much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
Property in the last seven years, only for two occasions in December, was a small month.
The authentic end-year rally occurred in 2003, during which the rubber markets came out of the crisis caused by the perceiving of the bottle.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, the December year was a growth of 6,68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consequent year of wins (for the time Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it is successful to computers on its end-year rail.
The Popular Bank will open 200 open offices 12 hours a Sunday
The Popular Bank decided to renew a large part of its offices.
Total 200 are the banks in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These concurrents, which will work under the Popular Max Mark, represent a great change for the bank.
So for the rest of the Spanish agencies, since this is the first group who decided to start on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20:30, and to open Saturday from 10 to 20:30.
Another group who also repeated several times would want to enhance the times of its sugars, BBVA, even if he has not yet decided to do the first step.
It is to conclude an agreement with the syndicates to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening a afternoon, but not publicly.
The results of the Experience of the People's Bank will be determined in order to access or not other bodies to this initiative that coincide with trade times.
This is exactly the aim that the Popular Bank seeks.
Attraction autonomous customers in these areas to purchase their bodies in the MMEs and the trading of the streets selected to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain in approximately 18 months, because it is not the opening of new agencies but the renewal of existing agencies.
For this purpose, it will modernize the sugars that he already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the customers' profile of different streets.
In this way, the enhancement of times is associated with a different design from the inside of the sugar and a new, more current, with more tragic colours.
The bank trade responsibility, Angel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not include large investments, but the employee's exchange, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have spaces to meet SMEs, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience was positive, like Angel Rivero.
The streets of Murillo Brave, O'Don's and the Grand Via of Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and it appears to have successfully, Family Rivero.
The Popular Bank has currently 2.500 successful.
And 60 others who work under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very pleasant hours, which even opened on Sunday and Fridays.
In these agencies of PopularMax, they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a large quantity of non-financial products for its sale.
'We do not want to competite our customers', note Rivero.
For the moment, they agreed with Telefonica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.
Double Telecinco for the first time the value in Bourse of its Rival Antena 3
We're here.
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, a delegated adviser of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closure of the bursier market, when he found that the string he guided doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A unique aspect of his joy was: 'What makes me bad, it is not the fact that we have grown more, but that we are less weak,' he said.
However, he focused on the fact that on a low market, 'We have less fallen'.
Telecinco ended yesterday with a progression of 2,54%.
This gain stabilised its loss of 15,66 % a year ago.
The value in Bourse of the undertaking controlled by Mediaset (52 % of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13 % in addition) is thus achieved by 4.488,88 million euros, of Bloomberg data.
Its Rival Antena 3, which was fallen in 1,52% yesterday and which has reduced 40.5% since January, costs half 2,193,46 million.
The value of the other communications undertakings in Bourse is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million in Prisa (Finco Days editor) and 1.779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is the fact that we speak of two similar companies.
The related fact represents what we are able to do on the same market to what price and how we renew it in terms of audience. '
Telecinco announced the last week that he intended to be the first television chain this year to exceed the 1.000 million brutal publicity incomes, as Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated adviser of Telecinco and Public Spain, the branch that manages the publicity of the group.
In order to make this year-based data real, the television chain should register 3,6% in its publicity fabrication compared to 965,4 million from the 2006 year.
In its part, the net facture of Antenna 3 increased by 1,6 % in the first nine months of the year (to reach ≥ 4,4 million) while the net TV income increased by 0,7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors that the analysts indicate for the best relative development of Telecinco in Bourse is the important payment that he has maintained until now: in 2006, the company presided by Alejandro Echevari distributed 100% of the benefit between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it was soon to make a decision, this could variate after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and with Mediaset.
' We have the official commitment to give for at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analyses, the market gives at this time signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of the benefits on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009, to 7%.
This is due, explaining, at the decreased growth of incomes from 10,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
The same company decreased the prevision of wins from 3 to 4,5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

The Congrès approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In comparison with its Parliamentary formality, which has been completed today with the vote of the Congrès of the amendments to the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to an audience and the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups were agreed to demonstrate the efforts made by the Members and Senators to negotiate and make the best regulation to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate the activities of the agencies to ensure that markets work effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Values Market Act, involves modernization of financial markets, while strengthening the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the Governors of the National Commission of the Values Market (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial consultation services to be provided both for specialized social reasons and for personal or legal persons and to create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultation companies (AFI), which join value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of financial instrument operational systems in order to ensure that the multilateral negotiation systems and the internationalisation systems are eligible for the current driving managers.
The Law also obliges investment services undertakings to distribute on the market information on the key aspects of its business profile, the risk exposure and the forms of risk management and requires them to maintain a register of all operations they perform, to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
By means of the Congress Economy Commission, several amendments have been made, including one that makes evidence that the holding debts will be considered as a "complete financial instrument" due to its high risk for investor, which has demonstrated what has happened with the obligation of US high-risic hypotheches (subpression).
Moreover, they benefited from the transposition of the direction to delimit the functions that the Economy diplomatics may have 30 years after approved in 1977, the kingly decree that delimits the professional functions reserved to the economy.
In its part, the Sennat incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for a company's account, which will not require the employment of the CNMV and which will be able to provide its marketing services for products and the attachment of new customers to different investing companies at the same time.
The price rate to the harmonised consumption increases from five decades in November, up to 4,1 %
This indicator, which serves after Eurostat to include it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance on the development of prices in Spain during November.
Its publication answers the Eurostat policy and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing comparable data in the time and quality of those produced in the United States.
The advanced operator is calculated by using the same procedure as the employed for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but by using various statistical modelization methods to evaluate the information on which there is not yet available for the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced operator is only indicative because it should not cohere with the final data that will be revealed on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue on relatively high levels"
The second President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, claimed that 4,1% of the IPC was a "time number" in November, but at the same time he suggested that the price rate would continue on "relatedly high levels" in the next months.
In any case, Solbes stated in the congrès boxes that "because the number is not good" the difference between Spain's inflation on the monetary union continues to be " more or less" as those last years.
He also explained that in November there was less surprise than during the month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We hoped a number of approximately 4%," the Minister of Economy recognised in comparison with the current year.
Virgin planning to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros for three years
Northern Rock depths have fallen to more than 50 % to 12.000 million books (16.800 million euros) since he has entered into crisis in the middle of September and had to have an emergency credit to the Bank of England.
At this time, he had a number of records over 25.000 million books, a number progressively fallen in two months and half because of its customers' failure and despite the guarantee of 100% of the money that the Government offered and that it would maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the emblem with its financial trade mark Virgin Money, needed to take around a quarter of the incomes of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years for the 18,000 million books remaining until the goal of the 30,000 million.
The major Richard Branson group, known for his newsgroup campaign in the United Kingdom, intended to expendirate 50 million books (approximately 70 million euros) per year in publicity and marketing for its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of Virgin, which is part of three other companies, including its preference to save him from the bankroute.
The Master of Totana was arrested for a presumed urban corruption trame
The Civil Garde today has arrested the Master Master of the Totana (popularity) community, in the early morning, due to its presumed relationship with the town corruption trame, covered this week.
Moreover, one of the secretariat of the municipal Council and the police officer of the municipality was also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me from May, Juan Morales, current deputy of the right, and even then the municipal adviser of the lawyer, and who is the sources of the request consulted by the SER Chain, could be the "master" of this trame.
Agencies continue to feed the municipality and the Urbanism Council and are not separated from the possibility of new detentions in the next hours.
Moreover, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the town corruption trame, covered at the beginning of this week, was imputed.
As indicted yesterday the Chain SER to the lawyer of the "popular party" lawyer Juan Morales, it was arrested by exiting from Morales' home with the important documentation in its possession of trame.
Furthermore, from the sources of the application, the request is the estimated income of Morales committees to facilitate signing a city agreement with a construction company of Galice to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight prisoners.
Bono accepts the candidate to the Spanish socialist party for Toledo and to preside the Congrès if they win elections
The former Minister of Defense José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish socialist party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congrès in the case of socialists will win general elections.
So the secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that was held this midnight at the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of the Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "the best" is important in the political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he highlighted that "yes it" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside the Congrès if the socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as the President of the Congrès, who last 15 November made its decision not to present to the next general elections and to leave its political career in order to combat climate changes in the university.
The former Minister recognized that the President of the Government did not stop insisting in order to return to the political frontier since he left it two years ago.
Moreover, he noted that, even though citizens already know who will be the economic President if the Spanish socialist party wins elections, his party wanted to announce the President of the Congrès in a "transparency Act".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the Room into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and to "they're more to the citizens".
"It is sometimes lamentable that the only local in Madrid where we cannot speak quietly and quietly is the Congrès, the President of the Government in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he had a vocabulary words for his current president, Manuel Marín and "he knows to do" and he did not want to do as if he had already occupied his position to not fall, as he noted it, in what his opposers could be considered as "a domination".
A climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to a perseverance without mercy, as well as the skeptics of its predictions as those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
It is more important for a leader of the movement that is the President of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than the islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach is the obligation to explain why the action or inaction of its Government has contributed in a decisive way that Spain is to the head of the European Union in the non-examination of Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it has been produced and why its Government, the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
Moreover, it must explain to Spain what measures he will take to reduce climate changes.
What enterprises will be affected, which habits of citizens will be broken, which individual and collective energy economy will be binding for us, what economic consequences it will cause.
That's what's going to sacrifice and pay to save the planet.
But there was no, and there will be no explanation.
Exactly because it is sacrifice and payment.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are inevitable.
Co-comfortable, incomprehensible and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Until the centurie of the proposed by the Spanish socialist party, he seemed readingly so dangerous to Zapatero that he was imprisoned by the nerve.
It is to say that it is to save the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
The proposals that have effect, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this master is so useful for electoral campaigns that do not speak, who doesn't deny and doesn't require, embellies the meetings and inspires the tenderness.
Since it is only limited to be a purely contracting party and which does not predict what we move in bicyclet or update with the event.
The Master and Chief of the Local Police of Totana arrested for a presumed trame of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmery arrested the Major of the Murcian locality of Totana, the "emerging" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of Marie and a suspicious hotel undertaking for possible urban crimes, reported today the sources of the query.
The municipal adviser was arrested at his home and was brought to the town hotel, where many agents at the moment were gathered, which also presented to the Urbanism municipal adviser and to the municipal company for the management of the Industrial Sol and the Camping.

Moreover, two other persons have not been arrested but are imputed in the Judicial Question, which the Court of Totana has taught.
The first six detentions have passed to a Judicial provision today.
According to the sources, Totana's municipal adviser and currently the autonomous parliamentary of the PP party, Juan Morales, is addressed by the request.
Moreover, the former woman, owner of an immobiliary agency currently registered in Totana, was imposed, as well as the current trusted of the former municipal adviser, resident in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and undertaking of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, the Nuaria Group Agency, and through which the pools of vine would have been performed.
The request is charged by the Group of Urban Delicts of the Operative Central Unit (UCO) of Gendermia, whose agents, in addition to arrests, have performed eleven inspections, the majority of prisoners and prisoners in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person, therefore, was arrested in Totana, in sum of the owner of a very known bird-product company in the region, who could have played the role of intermediate.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest resident complex of the Mauritanian community of Totana, which would include the construction of more than 5.000 apartments, a golf area and two hotels with "spa".
The company gained to Totana 2,2 million square meters of land which were requalified and its project would have to double the community population, which currently accounts of 25,000 people.

My treated doctor spoke to me about one of his articles on strange research titled: 'The money produces cerebral activity, especially if others receive less '.
It is to say that the feelings that generate the monthly payment of workers depend on what the workers win.
The study has been performed through tomographic magnetic reasons at the University of Bonn, and the results are included in the last number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the study author and director of the neurocognition images of the Institute Life&Brain, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers noted that when both people believed that they received the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so many sciences.
The procuror of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has continued to engage in the Balkan wars since the Public Ministry of the Penal Court for the former Yugoslavia, which is situated in Haye.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla will go with a go`amer, because the main responsibility for the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8.000 Bosnian muslims have died - the ex-general Ratko Mladic and the ex-leader of Serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic are still in freedom.
Their names are in this list of the documentary of the Swiss executive Marcel Schüpbach, the list of Carla ' (2006, not designed in Spain), with the rythme of a police triller, following the work of the Swiss prosecutor in New York, who continues to flee and presses the governments involved in order to retreat the circle.
What assurance do I have?
The car assurance, which covers the driver against events of disturbance, includes an important expenditure that will depend on various factors such as age, sex, anticipation of the authorisation of conduct, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use, among others.
Having a car is the main.
And it is that, choosing the suitable car assurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, choosing the suitable car assurance, it is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This commitment is materialised by an insurance contract, which establishs that the company receives the value of the granted premium and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation of paying the compensation in case of injury.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established in the light of various factors, such as age, sex, anticipation of the authorisation of conduct, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use, among others.
Insurance companys set their prices depending on statistics, in order to increase the probability of a accident is higher and the cost to pay is higher.
That is why persons of over 25 years and women must pay lower premises, since statistics show that these people have a rate of less disturbances than their intention.
Similarly, using recensions, companies concluded that married persons have the trend to have less than the soldiers.
The use of the vehicle will affect frequency, so the probability of a accident.
Increasing frequency, the probabilities increase.
They are many of the variations that the insurers take into account at the time of establishing the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must well study the situation to choose the car assurance that is best adapted to his profile.
We will present the most significant variations in the time of choosing one or the other type of assurance, so that this, rather than adapting to the assurance characteristics, offers him a reasonable price.
Youths less than 25 years have to face different inconvenients in the time of transiting a contract with a assurance to a accessible price, as it may be the low experience in the conduct and the extent of the authorisation of conduct.
Although the idea to be well assured is a guarantee for any risk, there are other more economic options.
The most preliminary drivers can choose to ensure any risk with franchise, so that they get the coverages of any risk insurance, but more accessible prices.
This form of convention includes that the customer pays a part of the amount of the currency.
"The part of the sum of the currency the customer will be established in accordance with the value of the premium, which will be higher than the amount will be low," spied Luis Noguera, the responsibility in Spain of First Europe, the mediator of online assurances.
Another option is the assurance for thirds extended, so that the customer provides protection to cope with damage caused by thirds, but for those caused by his own car.
Moreover, it would be covered against flight, incendies and loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are less than 25 years try to be able to avoid disturbances as soon as possible, since this will affect bonification, which can reduce the price of the insurance in the future.
Bonification is a reduction in the basic tariff of the company.
In contrast, a sanction is a majoration of the basic tariff.
"The bonifications and sanctions will depend on the company and the benefit of this.
If the company had a good year, it would be able to make the bonifications possible, ", Noguera clears.
For more than 25 years, it becomes easier for the drivers in the time of transiting a contract with a guarantee, since the rate of disturbance is reduced by the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferred to choose any risk insurance with franchise.
"Normally youths can not benefit from the experience of the preliminary acquisition after an accident," assures the Director of the European Company in Spain and › the majority of accidents occurs during the second year of conduct, once the ' fear of no'.
However, if the customer is married but has no children, it is preferred to negotiate any risk, since his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered as people with the lowest rate of disturbances, because majorities will be low.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk of any frequency (can be EUR 300) or an increased third-country assurance from the third year of the vehicle when the assurance has a high level of bonification.
"They have a more decontracted conduct and have a greater purchase power to allow them to assume a more important quantity of franchise," judges Luis Noguera.
For retraits, any risk with frequency is preferable (including 150 euros) or an increased third-country assurance when the securer has a high level of bonification.
It is necessary to say that car assurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver against possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expenditure, that is why it is essential to study the assurance that we are most appropriate to our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
Milan's and Celtic Glassgow are measured at the next Thursday in San Siro to search for the point they miss to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of Champions' ligue, since it serves Italy to be first and the Escocias to classify themselves.
The Italians total 10 points and have already been qualified during the fifth day through a new match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass before him.
These two matches of the Group D will be played a week before the sixth day ends, since Milan shall be available to the semi-finals of the Club Club World in Japan at the end of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the nul match in the stage Giuseppe Meazza is the most expected result, although both teams are trying to get out of victory, since the Italians will not want to spy with them and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning he would remain first and would ensure a better crossing in the eighth.
A defect of the Gordon Strachan team could be sufficient to classify if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it will not only be able to computer on it because with nine points the game returns to Ukrainian, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct dual.
Thus, the Millenniers are trying to attend the Spanish evening, who hope to classify for the eighth finals for the second time in the Champions League, after having been held during the last edition by a purpose of Kaka during the prolongations (1-0).
By waiting for the winning of the "rossoneri" the triomph would only return to Shakhtar, where the Celtic would lose, to classify for the eighth finals so that the EUFA champions could continue.
And it is that, although it is the last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, Benfai could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attended in Vancouver at the first concert of Spice Girls tour
Spice Girls started in Vancouver (Canada), before approximately 200,000 spectators, their first turn since the group was released in 2000.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm) and Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) have stated a little while before starting their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stage that the group's meeting is "brillant".
Approximately 200,000 people have spent the billets to attend the concert that has made a video in which the history of the group has become angry at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tournee coincide with the launching of a new album that represents their main success and two new songs, 'Headlines ' and ' Voodoo ', which EMI's in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are ascended on scene by showing the bracelets that Posh Spice's wife had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The sports was in the public that filled GM Place, even if Victoria had prohibited him a few days ago.
Beckham noted before the start of the spectacle, that the British footballer "he didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's gonna think about the spectacle."
'Sporty Spice ', which is part of the group in 1998 "for differences between us" and which caused the dilution of the group two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a training with pressure, two hours before the start of the spectacle.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw the feeling of people changed, the feeling for Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad that I had taken a decision," said Chisholm on the meeting of the group she had dissolved for nine years ago.
The song also noted that with time, "the things were dressed and that we appreciate much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl has been shown for the last time in 1998.
To start, CTV TV, the group arrived at Vancouver in a special airlines aircraft.
When they arrived in the airport, a baby-seat army waited for them.
They count to her five and seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will appear in California (USA), in San José (4 December) and in Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
They will be presented in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine takes the alarma.
A dispute on the price of gas is fertilizing between Ukraine and Russia, which thus increases the risks of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.S.) are conveyed by gases, and each conduct is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the fuel cost, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
The last year, a change between both, had caused a decrease of supply to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscou has occurred after the Ukrainian Government and Gazprom, Russian monopolie company who provides gas, had tried to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided for Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices in Ukraine since he accepted payment for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from Turkmenistan neighbor.
The analysts stated that this would lead to Ukraine, a increase of 40% of the costs of imports from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gases are transited,” announced the Ukrainian Ministry of Economics, Anatoly Kinkh to the Press Agency Re—s.
“The gas cost fluctuations would certainly be related to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) through Ukraine”
The last large change between Moscou and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom supplies for Ukraine.
This has caused the loss of exports to Western Europe to increase prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the European Union supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still developed.
As a result, Gazprom completed its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other countries from the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health ' must control its foreign employees'.
The Spanish Health Ministry must improve controls on its extra Community employees to verify whether they have penalties, stated the Control Committee.
The warning of the General Reviewer, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Escocia was involved in the attack on the Glasgow airport in June.
In addition, Mr. Black expressed concern about the fact that the Spanish Health Minister has no specific data on the number of persons in the outer sea that he is employed.
Its report also included other decision-making controls, correctly carried out on a five-socket of employees of five health authorities.
The General Revisor did controls on the extra Community staff after the attack of the Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, was arrested at the airport after he found his jeep in the ports of the main terminal.
He was part of the three doctors that were filmed in Old Bailey in October, because they were suspicious of being involved in various trials of car explosion in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health should carry out pre-employed controls on the other sea staff in order to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences and labour allowance for the United Kingdom.
Although the Spanish Health Ministry uses the Swiss Disclosure to carry out criminal controls, the Agency does not have any right to make such information outside the Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the report of the general revisor now states that the Committees are able to confront the Office of Penal Persons, thus allowing employees to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some information on the staff has been well checked, it is not done at every time." The report states.
Mr. Black stated that the Spanish Health Ministry has performed most of the pre-employment controls that he would make himself, but he also said: "Our report provides the aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that appropriate information on some members of the external staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Ecosse said that it is "extremely impossible" that pre-employment controls can identify employees who are able to do future terrorist acts.
He said, "The report suggests that pre-employment controls currently work well in the Spanish health system and that it is not sure that these warnings can be able to provide a value."
The Spanish health authorities declared that 1161 people of the outer sea, constituted for most doctors and farmers.
However, the general reviewer highlighted that these figures must certainly be revealed to the increase, in part because of the problems relating to the identification of the staff members of an undetermined contract, which would be able to choose or not to remain in our country.
The request showed that the current procedures for the control of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glassgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are actually appropriate.
These controls are carried out on passengers, work permits and qualifications.
The Swiss Government now revises its policy and its system of pre-employment controls for members of the other Ocean health services.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was enthusiast to perform this work after the terrorist attack on the Glasgow airport."
It embraced that the Swiss Government, associated with the Health Committees, would consider carefully the warnings set out in the report that should be conducted in the next month, and would commit to enhance the implementation of recently updated anti-employment controls and valid for all employees, including foreign-sea-sea persons.

The journal quoting a statement of the Ministry of the Interior stated that 18 of the arrested persons belonged to a cell managed by a "expert for the launch of missiles" infiltrated in the country.
It is said that soldiers planned against a band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the prisoners would have completed clesiasts and armed forces.
The Government requested the Church to make more against the Saudians governed in Iraq, to join the Al Qaeda militaries fighting against the Allied Forces and the Muslim Shit Government attached to the United States as a heritage and the hard line of Sunny Saudians.
The Al Qaeda soldiers believe that in Saudi Arabia, many churchists have joined the authorities to support the rules of the Royal Family Policy governing the Government.
The soldiers, encouraged by the calls against the Saudi Government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government immunition and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by armed forces in the last five months” said the door of the Ministry of the Interior to the state TV.
Among the prisoners, 16 members of the Media are organized in a "medium cell" aimed at promoting the "takfiri thought", the Ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports the resource to violence against confidential and post-postal muslims.
Among the prisoners, 32 people are accused of subventing military.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
The data issued by the European ship in orbit has shown that the planet is probably two times smaller than the Earth, in contrast with what we thought before.
Venus is the nearest planet of the Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that there were billions of years ago, Venus could have had similar conditions as those of the Earth, and could even have been resident.
But the sulphur effect caused carbon dioxide, the atmosphere erosion due to solar radiations attached to a late rotation led Venus to any other type of evolution.
Today, the planet is private of water, is devastated by oragans and light storms and has a quite warm surface of temperature to blow down there.
Venus Express's discoveries, the European Space Agency's survey, who studied the planet for a year, offer a grievous vision of the potential future of the Earth to the catastrophic changes of climate.
Professor of the Department of Oxford University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We begin to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from the earth, even though the planets are practically similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario which has been a billion years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, may even be with a living surface."
From the time enriched by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently of the ur, was sequestred by the Czechoslovakian and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer stated that three people were arrested and that the maternal is currently analysed.
He did not confirm that it was good of ura, but revealed that the marketing would have a value of $1 million ($480,000).
Open Return to All
Mitt Romney said not to be at the highest as a candidate to the president, to answer the questions of a good snowman.
Despite this, the Republican candidates at the Presidency finally accepted to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many electors who have recorded their issues, submit them to candidates.
Thursday morning, November 28, no of the questionnaires were as ridiculous as the issue of another debate from You Tube, when a good snowman asked the democrats their position in relation to the deployment of the planet.
But this time, the issues and answers reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate to the next elections.
The CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, have chosen You Tube's clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest of one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republic.
CNN requested some electors to phone when they heard pleasant things: The region has highlighted approval increases when candidates were expressed in greater manner.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is head of the major elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to rely on the fact that he was accepting Clandestine immigration during his mandate of Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, by the former governor of Massachusetts, to employ clandestin immigrants with him.
The two fighters became particularly fertilizers when they asked whether they would be ready to promote a "amnesia" (by offering a regular status to the clandestins and the opportunity to become citoyen).
Small candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressist, succeeded to extend this subject.
No one of them has the opportunity to be chosen, but both remain in the course, may be because they began to fight immigration before and more incisively than others.
Generally, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same opinions: stronger borders, and zero tolerance for Clandestin immigrants.
This subject, with regard to the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic games produced in China, or many other fears for the outer world, promotes the Republic to forget, or to minimize the divisions between libertaries and Catholic conservators.
But the debate has become particularly worried when other subjects have been raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for weapons control.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water should be put into the nose as a torture.
One of the participants asked whether the candidates believed in the whole of it, the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to say that the Bible is his preferred book, even if he is not sure to believe in the story of Jonas and the baleine.
Another intervenant asked whether Jesus would have been for the death penalty.
We were not attracted to see Mike Huckabee - in pool position in Iowa at a recent choice, thanks to his long-term Christian conservation - to say that death penalty is painful as necessary.
When we were insisted to know whether Jesus would have been in favour, he laughed and said that Jesus is too chic to present himself to the elections.
The humous race remains insolently open to everything.
The remont of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincide with the recent wonderful research of subventions conducted by the libertary Ron Paul, and the implications during the Thursday debate.
These two are denied by the fact that the two protected parties cannot agree to decide who is the most known and more traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the part of good time and convincedly through a message of success on the American size that thus refers to leaders.
This time, the party is divorced and the result is far from being.
The pains of the Worklists
Gordon Brown discovered a new shooting in which to shoot; even if he refused, the situation would not change.
With regard to the tendence of the British scandals, this is not particularly justified.
No sale recruits, nor hotel factors of Parisian politicians, no extra-successful wedding fingerprints.
But there is a revelation that a rich businessman would have hidden four years, under false names, its contributions to the current Worklist Party, equivalent to more than $650,000 ($3m), that the party would not have said: A new battle with Gordon Brown would have passed well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister went back in his election project, insulting the British intellectuality, announcing that the opinion investigations did not influence its decision, and that he hoped, in contrast, to offer a comprehensive and effective government.
In contrast, like Vince Cable, the Liberal Democratic leader, stated that Mr. Brown was transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's racket, a distressing bank at the border of the crack, showed a failure of directives and a medium-sized judgement in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change of tax code have resulted in coalition of industrial groups against the Government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative board.
A trio of generals at the retraite has launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reductions of military expenditure: they have declared that the defence minister is a part-time employment for them.
At the present, the suspicion of loud donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Workslists (and his ex-speaking leader) had to leave.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown moves to the output.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not love politicians and do not trust in them, but generally leave their doubts about the arrival of a new government.
It is obvious that a Prime Minister cannot improve the things, nor even govern for a long time, while it risks suspension: the administration is not working anymore; the Ministers' cabinets make the balance; the press search for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any purpose.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because contrary to other political leaders, it cannot be able to be a starter.
Although he wanted to replace Tony Blair, he was still his high-leader.
The issues relating to Northern Rock and the tax data, for example, are linked to Mr Brown's decisions when he was a chancer of the British treasure.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's disasters, such as the long investigation on the funds of the "Finans accounting for Lord's House", the electors could think the contrary.
But the difficult situation Mr Brown is not so tragic that she looks like it.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party believe it.
Like in Mr. Bean, there's no victim or scroquery.
And the medicine, although painful, may be to concrete the Stalinian trends of Mr Brown forever in favour of a reliable and cruel government.
The new scenario on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular person who compares his donations to charity, stated that he did not want any benefit.
He may have his opinion, but he is not to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of big political subsidiaries are determined, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know which contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated to be the coherent of Mr. Abrahams' programmes, without knowing that it was illegal, should therefore be asked, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the responsible for the collection of subventions that had spoken of doubtful donations in October.
But until this time, Mr Brown is not involved: Nothing lets think that he has been at the end of these steps, even if the majority of the payments had been made after its arrival to the Government in June.
To this end, the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned the failure of his party, but he did not take attention to the fact that the decision authority is on something he knows well, to make a questioning committee on this subject composed of an evic to the retraite and a judge.
In this case, lessons to be complicated are not complicated.
And if the law has been baptized, it's the police state.
Moreover, there are many other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent president for the independent Committee on Life Standards, without leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financialness of political parties.
This would oblige the Worklist party, at a time of weakness, to hold with the Tories, which could bring him to rejection of his special financial report with the confederations; soon, an amateur pill for a partner like Mr. Brown.
But it should face some partial facts.
The part of the conservators now has a good benefit for elections; it has two years to recover the electors, and the only way of a victory is to demonstrate an unreprehensible and solid integrity.
Card scatters.
Would the crisis of the hypotheches concentre the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it's normal to see locked nagels, tourbillon around.
Now that the American Immobilier's market crosses a critical phase, the preliminaries refer to the American credit card market.
Goldman Sachs' analyses believe that losses related to credit cards could reach 99 billion dollars if the county is hypothecs to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Pressure signs are Property.
There are increases in costs and insolvency rates, which measure the parts of the non-recoverable balance or which are, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced the last month that he took $1,4 billion in his credits to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of card porters.
He's too early to panic.
The costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the rate of insolvency of 3.89% of the third quarter is nearly a point compared to its average history.
The detection of rates is partly explainable by technical factors.
A change in laws in the United States in 2005, with regard to the personal bankroad, caused an abrupt loss from bankroad archives, which, in turn, caused severe losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the conditions of empires.
In addition, the industry announces fixed payment rates, which rely on the amount of monthly payment that consumers must rule.
and confidence in the capital security of credit cards is sufficiently strong despite the paralyzation of other aspects of the funding.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 would be more than 25% than last year.
The direct infection links between the hypothecs and the credit cards market are certain: consumers could prefer to deal with their endettements now that equitable immobiliary loans have disappeared.
But card issuers make more attention to the flux of species rather than to the value of the patrimoine, and thus the fall of the prices of the immobile has not necessarily made a change in the credibility of the impressors.
They could even offer benefits to credit licences issuers.
Consumers' premiums for the payment of hypotheches fall if properties cost less than the value of the premises; therefore, credit card-approval would be a priority to repeat all.
Card issuers are able to respond much more rapidly than hypothiatrics and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, because they can change interest rates or change credit limits.
This should in theory decrease the risk of having a rapid recovery of actions.
"We will not wake up on a morning and reevaluate all loans." Gary Perlin, Capital One Director.
If a financial disaster on the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk to have a consequent decrease.
If the lower prices of the immobiliary and a contract on the credit market lead America to recession, the industry must certainly face a macabre future.
Take care of the darsal narrows.
The British banks claim to be guilty for the case Enron.
The three British banks that have to testify their roles in comparison with a fraud made by the Enron Financial Director, Mr. Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement and claimed on Monday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were uncertainly stated in the seven presumed fraude fraud in 2000, made by Fastow in a secret financial crocheria to be rich, despite their employees.
They should be presented to the court in January.
But during an audience presided by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all claimed that they had committed a fraud.
The three ex-frames of Greenwich NatWest, a branch of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Ecosse, became famous everywhere in Britain due to extradition procedures that have been for two years.
In the United States, their case remains a question in suspension for this investigation after Enron's fall in 2001.
In 2002, the infirmities made Fastow understand that it was the subject of the government's request in Enron's debt.
The county against the bans, called "three of Natwest", said to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulous scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a branch of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, which was the scenario of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to strike the bankroad procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest for the branch as null, but the three British people already know their value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the branch bank for £1 million.
The banks paid $20,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy society was willing to pay $20 million in Greenwich NatWest for its actions in the branch.
But actually, these $20 million have gone into the britain banks, Fastow and others.
According to the facts, the banks would have won $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the other would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow committed his active role in two conspirations in Enron's debt.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year prison in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in prison for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released after payment of $1 million each, which requires them to live in the United States during the trial.
Earlier, the seventh larger national society, on a bankroute in December 2001 after years of accounting calls, could no longer hide its billions of enterprises nor even offer its bidon speculations as profitable.
It has caused thousands of licences, more than $60 billion loss of market value and more than $2 billion loss for retraite plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former President-General Jeffrey Skilling have been condemned last year for their implication in the creation of society.
Skilling was condemned for more than 24 years of prison.
Conspirations against Lay for conspiration, fraud and other crimes have been deceived because of his death caused to a heart crisis last year.
No sub, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and put a sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without Moscou's scale to Los Angeles, part of $54 million.
But this is just a small change for some Russian.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Although no one really needed so many seats as it is more than a family aircraft or the President of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the stand of Gulfstream, last Friday, in the Millennium Room, an inciting orgy for consumption for four days, which remains in a great center of exposure around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoped to survive the interest of the new Russian riches for their different products, walking from yachts in appeal to the cars filled with diamants like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer examined an oral porsche, exposed to his stand.
"is a beautiful car, but nothing is comparable to our product," he said.
"By the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
“By a oilboom, the Russian capital is running in black gold, such as Dallas”
"We saw the same thing in the 1890s when some Americans became so rich and were shiped in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, an ancient erudite of the Department Davis of Russian and Eurasian studies at the University of Harvard.
Like the Saudites in the 1970s, Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are like the biggest world expenditure.
The biggest luxe marks are looking for their place in Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscou, a conference on the luxe industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxe goods to markets like Russia.
(The Conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, belonging to the New York Times company.)
Russia has 53 billion billion valuable $282 billion, a list of Forbes that number the most rich people.
Moreover, two thirds of the rich are consistent of 103,000 Russian millions who are totally worth $670 billion, a study on the development of personal riches in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economic and financial research center.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005 15,8 per cent of Russian lives under poverty level).
“ There are hundreds of millions in Moscou, so we are all here, ” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London biutier.
She participated in the room for the first time in association with the Russian distributor, the Soho Bioutier Group.
“ Women are all well prepared, and men are worthy of strength. ”
By walking in the room, Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 say they are like their clients, millions.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mr. Yumatova, who entered his high couture robe like a wheat of the red pipe like Joan Rivers.
The room is mostly shown to the new rich, the type of Russian brand buyers that are disposed to make the cheue in the bowls to come to a large entertainment where the Cadillac Escalades are exposed, platinium canvas, Mövenpick ice, personal billion tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund pellets.
The public could buy the credits for EUR 30 ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in determining the most dear and best marks," Mr. Gijrath said, with an honest seat at the station of the Royal carrier manufacturing of porcelian Delf, in front of a wall table of Raimbrant on blue carriers.
"It's sure the Russian are more interested in Bling Bling"
In fact, the sellers said here that the Russian population of old capitals (10 to 15 years are too many Russian standards) have already passed from a kind of limited edition mark that could not be sold in the room.
Despite this, thousands of people, or millions, of millions or tourists, argue the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
Property the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, King Koil's bed PDG, stated that he had sold two seats of soja, cashmer, and cotton incrossed of gold sons.
In the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 moto sales manager, a company who equipped cars with last crying systems, also told him that he had sold to a Russian millionary, the porsche orche's, for $170,000.
From Sunday after midnight, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, a company who personalizes the luxe cars, stated that he would sell three cars like bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, $55.000.
He showed a reporter, the road of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be incorrupted by Swarowski Cristals to react to a roulette road.
The seven of four costs $22,000.
Mr. Karapetian said: "The Russian millioner who wants rounds made of a furniture, or a photo of his wife made by zirconium Âque, will not be forced to drive with such pneus."
He will certainly keep it in his garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian stated that the expression "Russian million" is not at the order of the day, since the prices of the real estate are here.
“If you had bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would be a million years ago, at least on the paper, if it is not in a species” he said.
“ There's more than you could think ”
Those who are not millionary can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of the Continental Alliance, a Russian patrimonial management company.
The company has made four stands representatives of the British phone cabines, filled with a mass of dollars of counterfeit.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said that his team printed 500,000 fake billets for the Millionary Room.
They are arrested to launch rates, ask their friends of photographers on their mobile, in the middle of this fake riches, or some millions.
“ You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a million years old, ” said Mr. Karyev.
Chirurgian doesn't appreciate homicide in New Jersey
It was the guard of thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the vibrated bathroom of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observed an ambulance that just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on the West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol comes.
And then another.
"And I saw the medical vehicle to stop," Mr. Livingston, a responsibility of the restaurant, stated Thursday.
That's where I realized that someone was dead.
The authorities would then have been a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant of the Department of Police Newark.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture excitated by an unapproval cosmetic chirurgian, which the police has not yet identified, resident at the 212th West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Mile Arroyo's death, but they expect to be confident that the results of the toxicological tests that will take time, but that should be allowed to solve this mysterious death that attracted the high ranges of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo was the assistant of the police manager, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenace, “Mr. McCarthy said about Mr. Arroyo in a telephone interview, Thursday. ”
“ she was like a pit bull”
“ She would have done everything to protect me ”
Mr. McCarthy said that Mr. Arroyo was married with Jimmy Arroyo, an ex officer of the Newark police, who worked for the Alcool Boys Control Commission, and she left two sons of 14 and 11 years, as well as a beauty.
Eileen Walsj, speaking of the Union County Park, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Mr. Arroyo is dead because of an unapproval operation.
"It is a possibility to consider."
"the question continues."
The authorities declared to have come to her at 15 hours.
and found Mele rockio on the sofa.
It was declared deceived.
A little more than one week has been spent, and the authorities have not said greatly about the question or even on the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not confirm whether Mr Castro was asked by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical cabinet.
Mercedy, no one opened the door from Mr. Castro where a fane roser stayed in the stretched cimetric front, and a Dalmatian was buried behind.
A blue bidon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute of the cooking vanille and for the parffs, was driving in a hangar, next to a gate that runs under the ground.
Two machines all the landscapes on the sides.
McCarthy said that since his arrival to Newark 25 years ago, in the Department of Police of New York, Mr. Arroyo was extremely valuable, he had to navigate in the new city and abandon its enveloped political culture.
“ she said, ‘You must take care of this’, said he.
" she was there when I was going, and still there when I was going.
"It was wounding"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will decrease the rate associated with the effects of the world bowl.
The actions are exploited from the two parts of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market would hope that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the credit conditions, which later reduces the interest rates made by the peaceful statements of the President of the United States Central Bank.
Boursers' markets explode in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald Kohn, no. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be " flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new tensions related to the credit, Mr. Kohn stated that the recent turbulence, partly, “increased certain improvements in the functioning of the end of September and October market.
In the case of this heavy turbulence, this would increase the probabilities of a later rigidity of the financial conditions for owners and companies, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capitals in the American markets and that further decreases of interest rate could stabilize the credit conditions.
These comments also allowed Wall Street to be calm with new news worse on the American economy, such as the largest decrease of immobilious venture for October.
The effects of this financial tumult have been accentuated after the Declaration of Bear Stearns, the investment bank, announced that it would license 650 persons, namely, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to lose the losses due to payments for immobiliary loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank works 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2,55% concluding at 13.289,40, while the largest, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, FTSE 100 took 165,5 points, 2,7% concluded at 6306.2 more than 39 £ to the value of the British companies.
German Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 grew 2.3%.
Previously, the recovery of the credit difficulties in the markets has been relyed on the strong request for a sale to three monthly funding businesses issued by the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to the European trade banks at the lower rate of 4,7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the FED and the ECB and to inject further funds in the London financial markets resulting from credit pressures made that the rate of three months debt "Libor" to the British banks has caused their highest growth since September, 6,59% after a strong remont from 12 November.
England faces a sentence to the judge in relation to the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmes, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the fighter #6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in such a broad context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of electors, who was there exclusively to help Peter Moors, the leader, and Michael Vitéhan, the captain, to take his decision, and because the Office of Hugh Morris, President-General of England, begins to fill the candidature forms to become a national elector at least part-time.
Whoever doesn't want to get the dosard #6 will be unfair, but life is often unjust and sport is also.
It is never easy to prevent what a man allows to come to the top of his profession while someone else will never be beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of happiness more than by lack of ability.
There is only a cricket that the choice is difficult, because at the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to make Bopara gone?
Is that just about Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, which is to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new frames with good diplomas, professionals, should be promised: but there is only place for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless we give him at least a chance?
The numbers have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eyes, at the same time he must take the door and a bathroom must be happy to touch the cricketer at one day.
But capturing the eyes of the electors is much more complex.
Many have better done the last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed sure to play the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison had been declared in full form and continued to try to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 tours to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already v· their time of gloriousness at the largest level and hoped to offer.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's going to play in the stage of Ashiriya, it's just a question of opinion.
This choice could prevent or build a man's career, but it makes a little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and successfully played in the first, with five doors and 40 useful tours, but Paul Collingwood, who was also fighting for exerting, who has succeeded to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and that, despite the fact that his double hundred marked against Australia can still be estimated.
The likelihood provides that Graveney, Vίhan, and Moores, after another discussion after today's session in the Ashgariya stad, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience against the exhaustion of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
For Shah, his impliant and significant beginning at the intakes of the 88 Test in Bombay, 32 cents of the first class against six for Bopara, which 22ans is seven years older, and its excellent classing at the starting.
But Shah did only ten tours at his two intakes in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his town of Middlesex player, and that, the immediate rejected by the electors when Vivehan again in form, he claimed his place for the next match, → had disturbed his elections so clearly in Bombay.
In contrast with him, Essex's player is full of joy to live.
Nothing fears him on a cricket territory, and he exagered when he was recently capoted on a 4x4 presentation of Volkswagen, a sponsor of England.
He reported only a hurtful, shocked, even if the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well) and call Alastair Cook, his team looking far away, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopara is the best battery far away, his filthy holiday allows him to do services that go to him, and he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the man just is a thing, choosing the right time in is another.
Maybe it's the real art of the selection?
I would be pleased to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean that Shah doesn't have to apply if, as the tee's faith suggest it, it will be him who will play this weekend.
Buses drive people to work, and fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqian repositories from Bagdad yesterday has arrived in Bagdad, overwhelming these exiles without silver or without visa renewals, or other who hope that the city has found the normality.
Some returned to fight the soldiers who have removed them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 persons transported in the conferences of the Official Government, the terminal was filled with repairs of Jordan and Jordan who were returned by their means.
"I decided to go in ́e after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Dr. Sunni.
"I came back today because I saw the television and read in the journals what happened to Baghdad and saw the city is more safe now."
"They say that Mahdi's army doesn't commit crimes anymore!" he said, referring to the Milice Shia of the Moqtada al-Sadr military, who imposed his men to go away for the time.
Cassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher of the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children, because he couldn't renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqians from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the mile of the United States helped, allowed Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his house north of Bagdad because of an attack on the Gree after he urged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to come back to fight.
"There were two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me have set an anti-Al-Qaeda miles in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys."
"This is why I come back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many say that they have been attracted by the growing accumulation of the capital since the American groups have arrived, and in the view of continuing training of "groups of citizens involved" well armed and with American military soldiers to defend their neighborhood.
However, others say that they have been committed to return because of the visibility and deficiency of the capital of Cuss, where more than 1,3 million Iraqians have been in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspiciousness of all the visions for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two million and half of people would have been from the country because of sectoral scenarios of death.
"We had no problem until Al-Maliki arrived and encouraged the Government to no longer give visibility to Iraq to force them to return to Iraq" said Sunni retraite.
“ I can’t trust a government supporting the hedgers who burned my house when I left. ”
The decrease of violence can in part be explained by the fact that Sunnis has been cast out from Shia areas and versa, creating places where the pressures are less.
We are afraid that a sudden flux of repeateds is not again the sectoral pressures and raise fights.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest Federated State leads to professional training, even by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in a field that a deficit is in the Sarrois, like the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the fifty-five times to a non-Sarrois, which we are not French" - is the slogan as the smallest federated state, by self-addressing, shows for his fifty-year-old birthday.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a great role in the Sarre training system, which is placed in the fifth system in the Monitoring of the Formations of the German Economy Institute of Colonia.
Thus, in tradition, high schools have closely cooperated with neighborhood countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students have the opportunity to finish their studies with a double, even a triple diploma.
It shows the high amount of 15,6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher schools than the average - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Sarre, we benefit from the professional training system," said Axel Plünnecke, expert in training at IW.
More than one of the five youths have been studied in a professional school, so Sarre has more than seven points above the national average.
So the possibilities of combination of professional and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of residents, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing request, however, the number of engineering diplomats has fallen from one third in recent years.
That is why the Sarrois Education Minister has committed higher schools than a marketing campaign in the materials of engineer sciences.
"By the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in the general schools," said a portfolio of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the Government introduced in all the federal state of comparative tests.
In order to begin early, the last year of croche is free of right - a model that is also copying during other federal states.
Only future comparative studies can show whether the performance of the Âs is sustainable.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the risk quota was reduced from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The bavarians get better out of here.
And despite saroes, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - we could win points in this area.
Because the neighbor's language is obligatory in schools - even if the sarroses are not French.
Keep Clock Rules
In Venezuela, the hours will soon do tic-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will restore the cronometer of a half hour in South America.
Chavez becomes a loading in Spain.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela, because of a new law, the times will be regulated at least four and half of the universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chavez justified its position among others by the fact that the United States would have imposed the world to separate time zones in hours.
Moreover, Chavez announced the breakdown of relations with the neighborhood country, Colombia, because of a case of otages.
Left nationalist announced that until the Conserver Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he would not have any relations with the head of the state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who fasts a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the Oil country will vote on Sunday.
With this reform, he would be sensitively strengthening his power in the country.
The dealer of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to return to Chavez the mandate of negotiations on the release of ottes with marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "breaked the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized on Sunday Chavez.
In Spain also Chavez is in all the mouths.
A new mobile phone sonnery makes angry in the country: "Why don't you call" (why you don't get back) is the phrase that have already downloaded on the Internet more than half million people.
It was announced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos, who, in the latest sum of Ibéro-American, was disappointed by the constant interpellations of the left popularists and who told her to taste himself.
A decrease of salaries threatened Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjournation, a pronostic, a real less-value of the salary threatens German salaries this year.
Experts have quoted all sorts of reasons to explain their pronemic pessimist.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the salaries should wait for a real decrease on their payment fee compared to the year.
"The fault returns to low development of the salaries, to the taxation on the value of the food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for macroeconomic and conjournation research, in the "image".
New charges could also be involved in salary assurance.
The Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück said in the newspaper "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the decreased lowness of employment assurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certain and reasonable in the present situation.
However, the National Employment Agency has no longer the right to find it in the embarrass to request the Federation of Credits or Financial Aids, the words of the SPD Policy.
Thursday, the explosion of food prices and hydrocarbons has moved the inflation rate to its highest level since 13 years.
In total, prices increased from 3.0 per cent from one year to another.
Venus is the hell of the Earth.
Despite his enemy atmosphere in life, Venus reveals more to the Earth than what we believed until now: the European Space Sodium "Venus Express" has discovered lights in the atmosphere and wind tourbillons in poles, like those appearing in winter on Earth.
Since almost three decades, scientists assume that there are lights on Venus.
The European Sound "Venus Express" has now brought the evidence - it has detected electrical waves at the atmosphere limit: the lights on Venus spread to a height of approximately 56 miles in cloud, Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the Scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the glorious Cyprine theory, the lighters would have made life on Earth: the orage would have stimulated the reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, an angle of life.
This is not the case of Venus: "If there was a life, it must have been at a very old date of history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institute" in Washington.
It should not be good today living things at the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about 100 times more deep than on Earth, sometimes there are 500 degrees temperatures.
"Venus may be the hell of the Earth, but it remains a cup," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so much to the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck with such a different development, is the issue of the ASE mission.
The department of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a major step in Venus research, since no longer was in the way for the exploration of this planet since the fourteenth year.
From the opinion of researchers, the latest results of research that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles not only highlight Venus' singularity within the sun system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of Our Neighbourhood are more than the first area.
So the researchers found, besides the wind tourbillons already known in the north pool, a cloud tourbillon in the south pool, which turns faster.
The phénomène recalls the air corners in the winter hemispheres, wrote a team of researchers around Giuseppe Pi日oni de l'Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the sun system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 km, almost so large.
The qualified star planet of evening or morning turns around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns a lot more slowly on itself: a Venusian day is 243 territory days.
Although Venus, with 460 degrees surface temperatures Celsius and 92 bar pressure, does not remind the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets are in similar conditions.
On both sides, the water was accumulated and remained on the earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in the space on Venus.
And when the carbon dioxide was fixed on the earth in form of carbonate, it is on Venus the largest part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler requests the end of the breakdown of the parties on the adoption of Dalai Lama to the Chancelleria.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks against the scanner after meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and sums the great coalition of clore the chersel on the rental of Dalai Lama.
"We must not present a divisioned nation on this issue in the foreign world," Köhler said to the Handelsblatt.
Parallelly, Köhler showed the understanding of Dalai Lama's acquisition by Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have a universal validity, even if I have respect for cultural differences," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in the field of foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but she defended Merkel against the reproaches which she would organize a new Chinese policy.
The German Channeler did not take its distances with the traditional policy of one China.
"Chine also knows it," Köhler said.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had directly informed its injury about the adoption of Dalai Lama and had been attacked for it outside the CDU range.
Steinmeier claimed, in particular, the "foreign policy" of the CDU on foreign policy.
After Dalai Lama's home to the Chancelleria, virtual irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese Government recommended not only the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also the Dialogue on the Strategy of Foreign Ministers in both countries.
The Chine Government leader Wen Jiabao now requests the German Channel Angela Merkel to recognize that Dalai-Lama's home was a mistake.
China, that European political men receive Tibet’s spiritual leader in its official functions, thus supported the Chinese position.
The words and acts of Dalai Lama would show that he tries to separate from China the Tibet and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble holds attention to emissions like France's.
Road fights with police, tickets, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble holds care against emissions like France.
Everything must be implemented so that social insatisfaction in Germany does not evacuate the streets by violence, the Minister of the German Inner Ministry has requested.
Barricads that burn, carriers who look on the police with chasing fuels: after the serious emissions of young people in France, the German Internal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive is not too with us and distorted in violence.
We must take this seriously," he said to the New Presse in Hanovre.
None of the young people would be able to go out with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federated States and the Communities had already worked closely to reduce the problems, said Sheuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From the summits of integration to the Islam Conferences, this has already shown its first success."
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Sheuble notes at the same time as in the German campaigns, there are no sociological problems or the view of urbanism as in France.
In the North Paris agglomerations, young people were delivered to serious street battles with police during last nights.
In Toulouse also, public cars and bathrooms burned.
Increasing efforts to integrate the German Government, the President of Turkey communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Count holding emissions in France, Kolat watched the "effects of imitation".
The situation in Germany would not be as explosive as in France.
But it would remain a need to act.
Kolat focuses on the fact that the unemployed quota in youths under 25 years of immigration would be higher than the average.
First of all, there should be more places for training.
Kolat insisted: "We must give youth a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Communities, however, had a social control in the families more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, "We must even be stumbled."
"Young people should have the opportunity to participate in work and training."
While waiting, in the Paris Faubourg of Villiers-el-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were located, and a helicopter overflowed the area with projectors.
The posting authorities participated in three arrests and some burned cars and pubs.
Since the conference, some 1,000 security forces have a deployment of peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, the Minister of the Interior of Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after visiting the faubourg.
On Wednesday night, nearly 80 police officers were wounded in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles were over to Toulouse.
The embarrassments exploded after a accident of employment in which two young people had lost life on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Parquet, the police is not responsible for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The outopic input of the chanceler shows that the coalition has been completed with the background - and there is no more to wait for it.
In what country does this opportunity live to the right?
After his disgusting intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should finally be governed by it.
The reproach of too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel from a hard and preconsuming phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and she just showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it has made all of how precise this reproach was.
There was no concrete interest or good feelings for the problems of the country to feel.
Instead, Angela presented himself as a cloud: a politician who was in the foreign policy and who remained in the nearest.
For example, climate protection: in this matter, it is still welcomed to the agreements of Sainteddam, but does not say how climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even the self-elogy - having so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have made it two years ago.
Now she cramps to all the facts that growth would touch people.
There she destroys its image of pragmaticist, which solves the problems instead of embelling the world.
But in the empire of the cloud Angela, the internal policy problems are a marginal phenomena.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-looking workers?
There are some accessories to him for this.
In this matter, the number of times it makes lapsus when it is family allocation.
Here, Merkel needs three delays to proclaim a specific half phrase.
She was in unknown area, since it becomes concrete.
La`che Attack
In the Youtube debate of the Republican candidates to the presidential, the two favours Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are in a harder offensive battle - and must now be afraid of an outside candidate.
The pressure of candidates is already in the first area.
He would have made New York a "refuge for Clandestins," Midt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This against his side by heavy prouds: "I would say that his own house was a hair for clandestins" Giuliani answered and replied to the former massachusetts Governor that they used immigrants without papers.
The candidates are attacked: as the Republic’s base does not have official favours, eight candidates to the presidential are used for negotiations on CNN in particular to discreet their opposers.
The 30-second amatory films that Internet users sent via Youtube are shorter than sufflers.
"It is with this kind of isolationism we left Hitler to come to power," launched John McCain to his Ron Paul candidate, who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate retreat of Iraq.
Romney also makes the lesson vigourously by the Vietnamian veteran, when he condemns as a torture which is called "Waterboarding", an introgator method where the noyade is simulated.
However, the fact that the major theme of the campaign goes outside the war in Iraq and the debates on torture are seen in the reactions of St. Petersburg's Common Room in Florida.
If the conservative values are louded or the future tax increases are made, the appreciation shall lead to the auditorium.
This is where it appears once again when the weaknesses of the two favours are resident.
"I have made a mistake at that time," said Romney contrists and presents his excuses on the basis and television public for being still a party in 1994.
Giuliani, in contrast, passes in a cowling node when it is asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civil.
One day after his return as the leader of the armies, the Pakistanian powerman Musharraf was invested as a president.
So eight years of domination by the army end.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new mandate of five years.
The Pakistanian TV directly transmitted the ceremonie to the presidential palace of the Islamabad capital.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the Nation.
Mercedy, he had transmitted his captain of armies to his confident Ashfaq Kiyani and thus was involved in international pressure, in particular the United States.
Eight years after he has taken power by a puzzle without blood fucking, the former general rules for the first time as a civil status leader.
As a result, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of opposition and O.O.A.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency state which Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Shortly after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the emergency status, the general prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayum, and thus will comply with another requirement of the O.O.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the emergency status with the courts of its orders, had rejected the last week all complaints against the controverse election of the head of State on 6 October.
In time, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribe region in the North Waziristan in an attention against a military convey, and four other wounded.
According to the indications of the military portfolio, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers make their return.
The supergroups of Germany for the sixty-dix years play: the three members of the Harmonia Group have reaped their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, records of their great success "Live 1974".
At that time, they were much more with the foreigner.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three years of missionaries in the district of the evening.
Everyone has his little bottle in front of him, his cab, and all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at 63 years of age, trone in the middle of a white chemistry as snow.
It is flawned on the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old youth and possessed by a mobile trainer and a guitar.
On the right, observed by all the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, age, covers on his console.
Each contributes to the voice, including a Beat.
And sometimes, it is inadvertent to a traditional music song.
This is not too much to deteriorate mysteries themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again has assured some emotions among Krautrock' amateurs.
We have the right to develop it here: targeted reviews show that the name is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case so sustainable so that this group is also painfully missing for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate its lives in the seventy-dix years?
More than what it is called "Krautrock" is still more plundered in the territory and in America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry determined Echo prices for their work in 2003 in Cologne Can's group's surfaces, the German pop faces were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups The Düsseldorf and Neu! in the pangyrical elog, the surprise had no more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother shot on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance among themselves and transfiguration in the unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio was only two years and that during this period, the impact power that seemed much weaker than that which was attributed to him by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promised name of Cluster.
We're playing a border in the caves below the Berlinish scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subvented by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had letterly deployed in powerwerk and finally made a name like gu^est with Neu! who was at the time the most radical German group.
In 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient closure of Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they saw as members of communities fleeing from the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Commune I", where Roedelius had the right to turn to as nurse.
Soon a artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
Soi-disant was in the pub a fanion of the Harmonia Ottenstein coral and also a name for the art.
Many retire Harmonia far from this.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because even severe and modesty as the music sounded, the group suffered from maternal misfortune.
The collection of the dead tree served him not only for self-search.
The CD "Live 1974" that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem before a public record of approximately 50 heads, and someone believes to remember.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train timely.
It was a immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother attracted in the esoterism sphers and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (Flammende Hearts).
Cluster reanimates in the fourteen years and has since more success than Harmonia had ever.
We need the Live of Griessem in Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Greenland has set the aim of encompassing Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to the modern music.
Neu! had already been deterred at this opportunity as the work of Roedelius.
The Resurrection of Harmonia is located in the World Cultural House in Berlin.
Subventionally, under the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, the old punk and author of the Krautrock Sampler pocket book.
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
The enemy of the fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be regarded as regards the future pop music.
The empty place left by the group will be combined by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase plans in the room in the middle of the individual sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are photos that show producers with Harmonia in the close room.
The projections of other photos in black and white tools capable in basear serve for the training of the engine.
Before, the three veterinarians are busy again to improve.
But more increasing microphones to org and bathroom, to draw up the instruments of unused sounds through self-constructed tools.
Today, the electronic music doesn't belong to the electronic music.
The three in large technical figs.
In this case even the coral of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we're all going and shot under the sound cloud, and we're sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been an extreme concept.
He never acted about rock.
The racines were less searched in the blue than in the Music Conservatories (Can), in the Âs (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artificial or social conventions (Cluster).
He who cries "68" doesn't have completely wrong, and Harmonia is not allowed now to be irrited by this now.
But what's going on is going to be covered minutely on the scene.
Where's the music starting and where does it end?
This can fall on the nerfs of someone (?) or give refuge moments of great joy.
Richard Gere isn't just quite cynical.
Avec "The Hunting Party" and "The Mord Paix", two films rearrange the war of the Balkans.
But they both don't convince.
Or projects are too much on the action and on the exchange of insects, in contrast, they are too laughing.
Here, even Richard Gere in the Hunting Party can't help.
The good news of the border: certain Karadzic and Mladic wars are always hidden in the Balkan mountains, but it is just there, in the backing of Bosnian war, that is then found by the actor Richard Gere.
Lastly, we had lost the most good man of the fourth-year-year-old, because many too deep and futilous roles in female feelings films and too many press conferences on the theme of the buddhism have delighted him to show himself.
Today, Richard Gere is the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the chassier becomes the cast (Why should today's films be as long and confused as collective conventions of lomotive drivers?)
He gives a wonderful representation full of eye climbs: in the background, his personality to report war Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destination and the film industry were not so well - a man who has his best time ago behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruin at his decline, kept the rest of his old charm.
But despite this, "The Hunting Party" continues to be with the German "Fire Mortal" production, which also comes out this week, the infinite suite of films rated on the war of Balkans.
The film is talking about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a serb from cosovars, in which one of the two is still lovingly.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not presented for one time as the only causes of all evils, this movie like a television is too quickly lost in the action and exchange of insects.
This remains a kind of "Alarme for Cobra 11" without authorout but with a war at the place.
In contrast, we can examine the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there was never a real good movie on the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, which are conditioning to trace the High War 'The Renard', may have become, with another realist and another scenario (two to Richard Shepard) at another time, a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories reveal in a hurtful manner: two males go into a small team in the forest, to do something that the soldiers cannot do and for both males, it becomes a travel in the foolish.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the cinatic deserted of a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must grant him a romantic aventury with a Bosnia and later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes permanently bad when reporting it, in the past five minutes, by a accelerated procedure, results in the fact that the NATO, → and all world premium chasers have not succeeded in five years: to catch the war and leave it for a just vengeance to the Muslims.
It is so bad that the International Court of Crime of the Hayes should be taken against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep concern.
He wants to declare that Karadzic and Mladic are still in freedom, and he suspicious the Americans and the French (his must be exclusively agreed) that they do not lead the caught in a very intense way because of secret political agreements.
But the good intended and the wicked is this time so similar that a famous poem of Brecht comes to the idea.
He speaks of a mask in wood of a Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compatient, I see the vineyards of the gonfly front, and it is: how fatiguing it is to be wicked."
The films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tuscent heads, but they suggest how fatiguing it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the type of films on the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this journal that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flocks.
It can be said: There have never been good films on South Africa.
What is worth every time: when a star comes on a crisis house or on a mine field, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go border" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with the DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may be too close at the time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood can turn a good movie on the holocaust with the "The List of Schindler".
Some films must still be mature - those who are currently worth classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been united at their time as work leaders.
But maybe we know this today also simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatombe comes directly on two screens at the same time at home,
And this is a pleasure to the scenarists that they need to tell good stories.
"By or not to be" or "The dictator" has actually become so well as because Lupéaisch and Chaplin do not know yet how the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't have to want to be good when we want to do good movies.
Maybe you need to have the sarcastic and distant artistic view of Lawrence Norfolk's romance.
When he was asked about the parallel between his historic "Dictionary de Lemprière" and the war of the Balkans, he answered, "This is only the fact that some things never change."
"The great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, men will always be embraced in a terrible way and the war will always rule in Yugoslavia."
Its Beust collects the criticism for the cancellation of Olympiades.
The recovery of the Master with Hambourg's candidature for the Olympicals of East Games has been hated in the political and economy of critical virtuals.
Many want to continue to take care of the Water Games.
But Von Beust calls the realm in appreciation of chances.
The main director of the Hambourg Commerce Chamber, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a deliver as a "boasted for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has been developed as much of motivation in the city as the idea of Olympiades.
"Unless this goal, the political-sport-relation could not be maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senat not to bury the project, but to find him a new longer-term department point, "which takes as a point of coming a different agenda".
Major Ole von Beust remained on Thursday to his declarations, which were the olympical ambitions of Hambourg, at least until 2028.
"This is not Hambourg who decides of an Olympics candidate, but the German Olympical Sport Federation," said Von Beust to WE ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation on the Munich candidate for winter games 2018.
This preference means for us that, in the time we had planned until 2028, we will not have any chance."
However, the dream doesn't permanently belong to the past, said Von Beust.
The sports Federation of Hambourg (HSB) regreted Beust's statements.
This would be the impression that Hambourg doesn't want to put his candidature for Olympical Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity by buriing the projects now," said the President of HSB Günter Ploß on Thursday.
A cancellation of the candidate would be more contrary to the statements of the head of the Senat at the occasion of the plenary conference of the German Federation of the higher schools of the sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hambourg's candidate at the Universities of 2015 as "no substitute" in the Olympics Games in Hambourg.
The Fédération of the higher schools of the sports had been in the past weeks called Hambourg as a candidate city.
The SPD fraction of the Mayor rejected the Senate that he had not used this valuable time in the Hambourg campaign.
"The development of the little Grasbrook has been held by the Senat for years because he played the Olympias card and excluded the building of apartments," the delegates of Carola Veit and Jan Quist said.
While the SPD has always claimed to the little Grasbrook a integrated plan in Olympiades and a later use of apartments, the CDU would have put on the "Factor Event".
The candidate for Olympics Olympics in 2012 would have a great enthusiasm for its part in Hambourg.
But Hambourg was broken against Leipzig.
That's not Warhols' boxes.
Whoever connects the concepts of Sweden and boxes in wood, thinks about Ikea, but not on Andy Warhol.
Or if?
At this time, wood boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on the list of works of Warhol.
A large part of the twenty-twenth Brillo-Boxs of "Type Stockholm" listed there are contrasts.
After the Swedish journal "Expressen" doubted a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of Andy Warhol in 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm is currently running to a dessensory result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former leader of the Pontus Hulten Museum had made a gift in 1995 in the Moderna Museet, are copies - and a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which are on the international market of the art.
The ancient story is completed, a discontinuing of artistic and curatoric production.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-Boxes" boxes, based on the red-blau-bla-bla-sheet design of sain cartons "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet was presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - hundreds of brillo boxes made of carton: These were not (for financial reasons) of Warhol, but were directly delivered from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not here of art works, but instead of their models, of exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given the employment in 1968 to produce some wood boxes Brillo in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the time today speak about about fifty wood boxes that at the same time would be right in the history of art and businesses, as Brillo-Boxes originally authorised from Andy Warhol, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than $100.000 in business wines.
The problem is now that the leader of the Pontus Hultén Museum, in a mistake, suggested that about hundred trees were produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have been sent to him.
In fact, the 105 boxes of Hultén were produced in Malmö in 1990 only for an exhibition in St-Petersbourg.
At that time, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the main main of the Moderna Museet, examined three other Swedish private collections, among whom two were constructed in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were printed and popped, then they were applied with a white oil pince.
The texture of copies from 1990 shows that the penting has been directly applied without the stratified panels, using a peinture roll - it is no longer a peinture for oil but a acrylic.
"They were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of the Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," lets the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another decision, the Moderna Museet will class the six cases in his collection as copies/mates of exhibition."
The Authentication Board has already heard that he would ask for the "lourdes" which will be raised in the case of sugar boxes in powder.
But since we've been in there with an inexorable silence.
Manille's rebellious soldiers abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandoned, the same who were thrown into a hotel in Manille, and who had requested the delay of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who reproached the President for corruption and electoral fraud, said to reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any blood exfusion.
The faithful soldiers to the power had sought a little before the hotel was sitting with the lacrymogen gas.
The two twelve soldiers were spent for hours in the bathroom.
Approximately the half of them were held on Thursday before the courts because of a trial of push missing in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He benefited from the audience to subsequently with approximately 30 sympathisants.
The military police, which normally monitored them, appeared to have devastated in his favor and were joined to his mutinery.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and requested President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal groups to the power cut the sector around the respectable hotel.
The Chairman calls on a urgent meeting of the Safety Cabinet.
The National Security Counciler Norberto Gonzales condemns the action of soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the elite unit of the Scouts Rangers, said that other military units would be lowly able to join the road.
The criticisms of the regime were called for a great manifestation against the President of Thursday.
His government has been circulated through corruption reprocess for months.
Manille's finances' quarter had been the theater of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurance was breaked about 24 hours after the army was joined there.
Since 1986, at least seven puds have been tempted against democraticly chosen governments in the Philippines.
The United Internet becomes a main actor of Versatel.
The United Internet has provided more than 20 percent of the telecommunication company Versatel.
The average price per action is 14,46 euros, such as the Monday company.
Only 20.05 per cent of the social capital would be detained.
We've already been spent on a rabat before.
The option would remain open to continue to participate in Versatel.
With this step, we are trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, which was United Internet.
Just before, supplies had already been made on Thursday on an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation to the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15,1 per cent.
The credit institution would have the money only for a third party, which is on the market.
The guard, the United Internet has already received a nearly 10 percent participation in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
In the context of an increase in capital, Drillisk placed 17,4 million new actions in Bourse with a value of EUR 106,4 million.
The United Internet bought 5,15 million for 31,1 million euros.
Furthermore, companies opened negotiations on DSL products and mobile phone cooperation.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet portfolio.
The two companies funded the MSP participation company to absorpte the Freenet competition.
For this time, both companies want to be satisfied with their 10 percent participation in Freenet, and do not use their right to rent 18,49 per cent additional to Freenet, trusted the United Internet Thursday.
However, both companies would leave all open options, especially to participate in the SA Freenet, have been learned.
The negotiations between the United Internet and the Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The poker is still difficult to predict Freenet, which is part of the consolidation of the German telecomes market for months.
Freenet had at the end of the third trimester 2,9 million customers associated with a mobile phone contract and 1,27 million DSL clients and complete signatures.
The Holding of the United Internet and Drillisk had a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 per cent until now.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent additional.
The right to buy at 18,49 per cent of the Vatas investment company has already been decided in aa.
