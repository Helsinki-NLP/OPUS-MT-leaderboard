Remember the very ananical idea of work rights as human rights
The Congress Deputy Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organization of businesses as civil rights.
"So as businesses die, the media-class jobs die," Ellison, a democratic from Minnesota and a steward-president of the Progressive Caucus in the Congress.
Thus, I am proud with the citizen rights icon of John Lewis, the Co-operator's authorisation law.
This increasing law provides workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate for the organization of businesses as in other forms of discrimination and stops such an anti-operative force.
The completion of national labour law in order to create an opportunity for a discrimination of workers to organize a Community consent to claim to justice before a civil court and to obtain damage or penalty payments is a significant and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not radical initiative - anyway not according to standards.
In fact, the best way is to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislation are proposing, the connection to a very ananical idea.
Despite the repayments of the workshops in the past years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and in other countries in the whole country, the Americans have encouraged only countries worldwide to recognize, expand and maintain work rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still reminded themselves when this country called democracy, freedom, press freedom and the right of association in a spirit course.
When the United States, after the Second World War of Japan, encouraged General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff to adopt a Constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full knowledge of the fact that the workers and their workshops adopted a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "the rights of workers to association and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied after the Second World War of Germany, General Dwight David Iisenhower and his staff forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the Phasishism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organize themselves, and their vote in the new nation should be raised, the Germans shall introduce a clause that expressly stated: "The right to establish unions in order to ensure and improve the conditions of work and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and to every professional or employee.
Agreements which threaten this right or intend to deteriorate it are zero and dismissable; the measures to which it is intended are unusual.
When the former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt contained the Presidency of the International Human Rights Commission, from which the General Declaration of Human Rights was discovered, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, the Roosevelt and the other representatives included a guarantee that "each has the right to make businesses for the protection of his interests or to join them."
Since general, Americans accept the fundamental premies that work rights are human rights.
When this country relates to other countries how civil and democratic societies can form, the Americans explained that the right to establish a community - and that this community should then participate in colleative negotiations as equal partners with companies and government institutions.
After these rights are in America, it is really very wise to lead back to the Ananias idea, so the working people must have the right to join themselves and make themselves in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said for fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
The highlighting of the life standard of millions of people has created a wonderful market for the industry and has highlighted the whole nation at unprecedentable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story keeps them.
The story is reminded, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of work rights as human rights - and the enlargement of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employees - is longer overcome.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideas that have made America great in the past, and the promise of democracy.
The judge stops the timely law that all the licenses in Louisiana could force to close
A United States Bundesgerichter interrupted the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, by the advocate said that it would probably lead to the closing of all five discharge clinics of the State.
This measure, raised by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana in June and entered into force on 1 September, would force doctors to purchase a hospital right within a 30 miles of radius for their practice.
However, the Court's decision means that the doctors may continue to carry out legal derogations temporarily while they have such a right.
"The complaints can continue to work legally, while they strive to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Justice John deGelleselles in judgment.
A consultation for the judge shall be made within one month to make a more durable decision for the law.
In addition, the decision of the youngest in a number of judges against similar measures was welcomed and said that doctors had so much time to gain hospital instructions.
"The today's decision means that women in Louisiana have a sustainable law that wants to take them their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and president of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, which had been covered in the name of three of the five clinics of the State to keep the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the sentence was also referring to the doctors from the two clinics that had not joined the complaint and also requested instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 States who have adopted similar laws, which recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi not constitutionally.
The key positions of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics in the state to close, were arrested by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Requirement, agrees that the instructions rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Injuries believe that the measures served for the protection of women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a Arʹ, which is conducted in Louisiana, has been aware of patients' rights, shared the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to do no longer discharges, this ar would have been able to not carry out the operation anymore, the group said.
In their argumentation against the judgment, the representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish any doctors for the implementation of the derogations, while their requests on the rights of patient were still dependent.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to death rates through egg-stock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have set a videohome for their mother online that died at egg-stock cancer 2007.
For women in the rural areas, there is a risk to die in egg cancer than for women in towns.
Researchers analyzed the medical data from more than 1100 surfaces in which egg cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 Pro · five years after diagnosis were still living.
The research leader Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the State, the death risk was about 20 Pro日 as for those in urban areas.
CLEINE STUDY: New medicines may require long and egg cancer
The researchers investigated the medical provision of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of egg cancer, existing prevention diseases and the social and economic status also affected the possibilities of survival.
For elderly women and those whose cancer was already progressed at the diagnosis time, the survival rates were lower.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the State, the death risk was about 20 Pro日 as for those in urban areas.
Although the eggs did not investigate why living women died outside the city with probability of egg cancer, Dr. Jordan convinces the late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment as possible.
"This illness is treated in the best of genealogical oncology, and most of these are to find in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of the telemedical services to resist remote services, she, as a possible, proposed a strengthening of the service of involved doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the geographical status has produced a bad long-term survival rates in women in egg cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and pre-respect strategy.
The financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in Medical Journal of日a.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old young mother from the gold coast, experienced that she had an aggressive form of egg cancer.
Garden guards deteriorate householder payments
The reduction of the number of householders under 35 years could lead to loss of gardens thousands of pounds per year if today’s young consumers are in accordance with the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, which produces the "Kernel Group for Gardens Products".
The report states that the Mieter is a average of 55% of the amount of people with own secrets for their garden.
The growth of people living in high urbanised areas without gardens, the popular procedure to approve forwards to parking and the swimming garden sizes are more than 5 billion £ per year in the sale.
In London's large room, where the share of households has been fallen over a period of 6 years from 61 to 43 per cent, the lowest expenditures for garden products per household are indicated.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society indicate that residents do not mean to the middle or small gardens that people can't move.
Guy Barter, Chef Garden adviser for the RHS, said, "Container gardens, for example, are very polytheists at the meetings because they can take their pf ́s on a road."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "good age" of the trading of the Garden Area due to increased domestic property and economic welfare from the latest 1980s to the middle of the 90s.
He also proposed a improved market situation for this year due to the best weather following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement indicated by the Opposition Policy Imran Khan and the church Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the main town of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators have hit the State televisor PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers would have been able to refrain from PTV buildings.

A kilometer away from them, they offered together with stones and stones equipped with security forces.
The police put the train gas.
The demonstrators requested Sharif's retreat, but he refused it.
The army of the country thus urges a political solution to the conflict to "support without time and use without violence".
After a meeting at the main quarter of Sunday, the military shared: "The Army remains obligated to ensure the security of the State."
The military plays a major role in Pakistan and has already been more frequently putting up.

The protests were scaled on the week after Khan and Qadri called their attachments to prevent Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.

Police officer of Magaluf of the corruption accused
On Friday, the candidates presented evidence of pressure by police officers and officers of the city of Calviá to the office of the State Advocate of Mallorca.
The head of the police of Calviá on the vacation island Mallorca was arrested after corruption of business officers and bar owners in the based Binge drinking Hotspot Magaluf.
Main Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was taken in investigation by several business clusters from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and night clubs of Magaluf were located.
According to the online journal Mallorca Diario, the applicant presented evidence of pressure by police officers and employees of the city of Calviá to the office of the State Advocate for Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption projects and were asked by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish journal ABC reported that the injured night owners claimed that the veterinary economy of the authorities had serious effects on their business.
"It's not about money, it's about survival," said one of the business officers to the court.
Let our life base out of the game.
We don't have anything to lose.
Magaluf made in this summer a viral YouTube-video international slag lines, in which a 18-year British tourist was shown, completed by 24 men during a sauftour Fellatio.
The island recipients have also tried to stop the correct behavior of alcoholized licenses in Magaluf, minimising the number of participants to the related alcohol-related kneipen tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio event was found, was forced to close for a year while Playhouse and the Kneipentour Organisator Carnage together had to put a penalty of 55,000 € (73,000 dollars).
The tourist site Magaluf, which is especially involved in young British vacants, is also for a number of accidents under alcohol influenza, including the trend of the "Balconing", where people walk from a balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first Friendly Day of Friday with Nass and Sterm Weather Conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has protected South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy winter and strong wind, affecting flights from the aircraft Adelaide.
On the evening to 21 hours, more 5 mm rain fell on the city, after 6,6 mm that had already fallen down on Sunday night.
The last disappearance was the result of a series of short, stearmic spectacles, a guesse who started shortly 20 hours ago and cared for almost 4mm decreases in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week for a early dose of freshling, the temperatures in the city fell on Monday to a maximum of only 15,8°C.
The weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight by Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft had to land shortly after 19.30 a.m., but it was found by a screenwind - a sudden change of wind speed or direction over a short distance - and it had to be started.
Wind supports reached at this time about 50 km/h on the ground on the Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the flight also had to be launched at a second country flight and set up around 20:40.
The flight spending resulted in the latest of some other flights, a Emirate flight from Dubai and a quantas airport from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is foreseen on Sunday, with possible glasses.
Matthies means: the maximum time for big destruction
In view of the gaping technical progress, which makes our proper home to high-tech-scalculators, our colonist Bernd Matthies is drawn up with an overlooked electronic advice.
When I write this here, my lock falls on the spiral box that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how back is that?
But there's a review that if the cab wasn't, all listeners would run in the house in the shortest time, and that would still be significantly more back.
Unless it applies to the electronic (electronic)?
No, tip error: electronic) Sector the rule that the world's newness of this morning is covered by the electropat of the morning.
And for example, whoever has another TV in the apartment today, he only says that he rejects television basically.
Why are these discussions?
Because the decline of the ifa at the radioturm this week brings us our absolute incompetence in the issues of the electronic.
The Laie, who controled previous wash machines and CD players blind today, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread before him with an unfassable expert talk: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you going?
What is it to talk to people who are probably voluntary to spread such a Quark?
In fact, it's been about 20 years old, especially because we're going to devastat our house.
In order to imitate the joghurt himself so that the brand reporter informs us at the vacation of Malediven that it burns in the work room.
And it wouldn't be wonderful if we were from the Office from the climate facility on our quick arrival ...?
Yes, however, it provides a climate facility.
But a dream will certainly be true in the darkness: We have our armband holidays, you say, "Säpen!" - and to the house, the powder's robbers will go away.
I'm wrong.
Everything runs to nothing less than a revolution outside: "The limits between white and brain goods" covers a brain identifier, you can connect the wash machine to a head auditor, the dampfgarer sends the weather report and the data brilliant shows how long the pizza is on the backup, but nothing is useful because we are in silence.
From the daily practice, we also know: If a newmodical device is actually used hardly, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What another reason is that the spiral cabin on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the regions near the Gaza street returned to schools on Monday after they had delivered the summer in air protection rooms, while the racket and murder commission on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and the Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the campaign was recovered.
The school start was a feeling of joy and expectation, but the signs of the battle are still fresh.
In the South Ashdod, the workers of the "Pashosh" kidding garden, found by a rakete, before the students met the Granatsplitters from the walls and shields.
"We have a little bit, but we're excited," Ronit Bart said, inhabitants in Kibbutz Seed and English teacher.
Children from our territory need the back to a routine.
His 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little funny" to go back to school.
"There were difficult times, and we haven't gone out of the house," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border of Gaza to provide its support.
Until a weapons standing the war last week, thousands of people of the border communities like seed remained in their homes or left their homes to move away from Gaza and leave the raketen and marble fire.
Family residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border of Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian marshergranate, still hunger with the back.
The Ministry of Education shared that about a thousand families have not yet been returned.
Your children were temporarily undertaken in other schools.
Premier minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city in Gaza, which was hardly held by the Palestinian committee.
He invited the children to learn much and said, "We'll make sure you're getting safe."
Israel and Hamas agreed on Wednesday on an unexpected state of weapons.
The weaponsruhe was providing a immediate end of the fight; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as the Hamas requiring the Israeli-Egypt blocked of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel requests the destruction of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed by the battles.
A new indirect talk will probably be started in this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2.100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of their civilians, and at least 494 children after the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel strikes these information and appreciates at least the assistance of the killers to fight, but did not provide concrete indications for these information.
On Israel’s side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thailand worker, were killed.
Hamas and other battles in Gaza feeded 4.591 rackets and brushes during the battle in Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
The Israelian military led more than 5.000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks protected or disturbed thousands of households in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people seek to flee to more than 100 UN scholars that were converted into temporary protection rooms.
Currently, ten thousands of people continue to live in the protection rooms and fighting, the students moved last week to the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school is soon open again so that we can continue to learn as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Sachsen: CDU Vize Strob requests NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the loss of vote of the NPD in Sachsen, the CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl has spoken to the end of the current NPD prohibition procedure before the Constitutional Court.
Berlin - The CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl should end the current prohibition procedures against the NPD before the Constitutional Court.
"The NPD snippets worse than the last time," Strobl, who is also a CDU country boss in Baden Württemberg, the "Leipzige Popular Journal".
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and development, which allows me to make the result of political conflict with the NPD, not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was completely unable to vote on Sunday at the five-pro-pro-Hard.
The first approach for the prohibition of the right-tree party was failed in 2003, since the constitutional protection was at that time in the NPD.
In December 2013, the Bundes Council, after long preparation, introduces a new request in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundesday did not end.
Harburg: Zelt for new refugees
In the new country, refugees are now in Zelts.
The central first input for refugees in Harburg platform from all neighbors.
Now the inner members have allowed three circles of the red cross to set up there.
The region policyers were notified shortly before - they are a little disappointed.
"These hauruck actions continue to cover citizens' preservations and give the citizens no opportunity to contribute to the human transfer of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, the group of the Green Group in the Harburg district assembly.
Your party requests that the circuit administration of Harburg provides currently unused homes for delivery.
96 refugees can be placed in the three cities.
The reasons for the overflow in the first receipt are the emergency of the applicants - and the condition that the authorities cannot provide enough places in the following facilities.
So refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have reached the highest winter growth in seven years, showing a broadly observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for own homes in the Australian capital increased in August 1,1 Pro, so the RP data from Monday.
This growth increases the total increase in June, July and August by 4,2 Pro, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was at 10,9%, more than double than the increase in 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not equally distributed over the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne were assigned to a two-partial market.
The numbers of RP data indicate that the house prices in Sydney increased by 16,1 Pro in the past year, but in Melbourne at 11,7 Pro.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, in which the prices increased averagely about five and six pro.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was severely affected by the injections of State exhibitions, and where the prices increased only by 1,4 Pro.
Mr Lawless continued to say that, with the beginning of the breakfast, there would be an increase in the immobility that would be undertaken to the market "a real test" for the next months.
"If you consider the high rate of the auktion prices, a general fast rate of sale and the secondary low rate, it is probably that the proper home prices will continue to grow in the next three months," he said.
In a opinion on the New Presse, he resists the statements of the business leader Peer Medau and confirms that it is "as a field leader".
The style of the high school is not this, it is in the communication.
Thus, the Medau family has already been informed on middle June of the high school's opinions.
The statement that the plans have been only in July, are definitively wrong," as a puzzle.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-determinations or decisions", but "preferences" are "preferences".
In addition, the low road building needed for the driving is less dramaticly protected than the medaus.
It was from a nine meters wide street and it wasn't the talk.
It is currently about 5,50 metres, which is a meter larger than until now," Pöttzl explains.
The argument of the Medau drivers that their free and schoolless parking areas in the future will be used only by students of the high school will not allow Pöttzl to apply.
The park will not be at all because it is possible to solve the middlely intellectually as in other public parking places.
Think of the inhabitants
The Child Cryps of Mountain, which is on the ground and would lead to the road to the park cover, would be "not affected by the high-school president".
Moreover, it is to think that this is not just about the children's ships, but also about the residents at the invitation to Friedrich-Streib Street and the 800 students of the neighborly real school.
So it's much more than the partial interests of Mr Medau," so Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the Children's Children's Children's Board, with the building of the street, would have been allowed to lose a small natural fleck of Coburg, "the reader himself could decide."
In the beginning of October, Pöttzl and the State Budget Bamberg want to inform the town Councils about the building of the High School until 2020 "and in this context respond to the importance of the new exemption".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's cryps last week about the plans of the high school.
Therefore, the train for the new parking cook should not lead as far as this is over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib streets, but over the Medau-Barg.
This is how the slight road should be built two-speedly at an kilometre length.
According to the Highness of the Medauss, the construction in the park of Sloss Hohenfels would be made to make it possible.
About 2000 vehicles daily is the talk.
On the sides of the city, you wouldn't have been able to speak to the town until now.
Glandorf returns from handball nationality
Holger Glandorf will not play for the DHB team anymore.
The 31-year Federal Liquist SG Flensburg-Handewitt caused this decision particularly health problems.
The decision is not easy to me, it's been made over several months.
It's time for me to hear the signals of my body and stop my car in the national community," the World Master of 2007 shared on his Facebook page.
It is therefore going with a bi­ 167 country games and 576 tours for Germany in the international rest.
Because the famous backspace player for the Champions-League Seager from Flensburg wants to go to Torreagd for a few years, he is now not available to the new Bundestra · Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Iceland, which on Thursday has its framework for the country games against Switzerland, Glandorf conducted a long and long talk.
His ideas and comments have made me just as they will be pleasing my long-term partners and my followers.
But for my club I would like to be healthy in the next years, there are longer regeneration pauses that do not allow the current double load.
The left handman had to protect his car end after a fersen infection in 2012.
As a result of the problems of Achille-situation, he had been allowed to treat himself with a cortisons-court that later had solved a strong burning.
One note operation and two other entries followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the Communityary, and the commitment ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of Profi and 11 years of national community carries no body.
I have some healthy buildings that I can't ignore anymore.
Following the three infection conditions of foot-up operations which have been performed in short distances in 2012, I have never reached my blood pressure right in the head.
Here are some other disagreements.
At the beginning of the year, I have noticed that if I control my head, but my body can't be cut," Glandorf said in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he would only be prepared in absolute need.
"I'm always ready to talk when all the strikes go up," explained the two-fold family father to the pharmaceutical.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play a handball.
I must also say that after my long hospital residence in 2012, I have become quite humiliated as regards my health.
After my car, I would like to be able to go at least some points just.
Besides the WM Title 2007 and the winning of the Champions League 2014, he received 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF postal.
2012 he also assured himself with Flensburg the European Pocal of Pocals.
German economy spent in the early year at 0.2 Pro
The crises around the globus have burned the German economy in the second quarter.
The Brutto-Inland product was decreased from April to end of June 2014 in comparison to pre-quartal by 0.2 Pro.
This shared the Statistics Federal Authority and made provisional arrangements.
Only the consumption was the economy in the early year, while the investment returned.
In addition to the external trade, the conjuncture broadcasts.
Thanks to the strong annual stage for the first half year, a total of 0.8 pro-pro-PIBs has occurred against the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the beginning point and the goal of the "Münsterland Mooister", which led first on Sunday by the Burgmann city.
The Burgmann City Horstmar experienced an invasion of the Netherlands "Fetch Road".
The biggest raw sport band of the Netherlands, N°U, was the so-called "Münsterland Mooist".
This involves the largest radiature, through Münsterland, the radiator paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked them for the organization of the Münster country.
This tour was offered interested.

Katharina went to a small "F's travel" through the city over the wall, where the start was done.
Furthermore, the road, issued for three different categories, directed Mrenholz over the crepping mountain in Coesfeld and Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On streams of 95 km with 1175 height metres, 120 km with 1475 height metres and 145 km with 1775 height metres, the radiators proved their condition.
They were spent in Havixbeck and Billerbeck on the road.
Heinz Lölfing, Master Jos, was very pleased with the event of this Radsport.
We are satisfied, and it was a good experience for all participants.
The organization remained without problems and there were no negative cases," Heinz Lölfing is a positive fashion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not so many participants as the agent had hoped, which was probably at the bad weather forecasts and on the morning rain.
"We see us again in 2015 in hopefully beautiful weather on 30 August or during another week," but the radio carriers are still going back to the Münsterland and the contemporary planning a new upload.
Constantin Weckers increasingly honest memories
It is more philosophical witness than biography, which has made Constantin Wecker, Liemmacker, Pacifist, Political Activist, Ex-Party, 287 pages of paper.
Not cronologically, but more thinking feet for thinking fetters, the Münchner who was born on 1 June 1947 wrote his memories, each chapter started by a text of songs.
And he is inevitably honest: from Onania as a gymnasiast to the laden depth and consumption he does not allow human weaknesses.
Also to show how he himself taught tolerance in relation to his fellow believers.
The wide room also takes abstract, but even more important terms: love, soul, ego, his now, spiritality - all of that he is trying to go to the reason, in very philosopical, but also very personal way.
And he also shows his pacifism, his society criticism, his political commitment - and also, as he did not only the music (the oper lovers became to the social and rock musician), but also his detention in prison.
Later, Constantin Wecker also approached the asketic moon, which is "with subtraction", as he says, "without leaveing everything in need".
Among all the high-geistic views, however, there are short anecdotes to the earth: sometimes about shoes in one of the GIs frequently located or a vital car car, where he has forwardly indicated a tree.
He's also honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.
He never said, "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a Jamaica in Dudley in Midland in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19, was limited to a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry pro > for a commodity, Rudy's rare records, which is partly discussed on an imaginary conversation with Father and was from the radio 4 series.
The Sound Track is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with live melodia.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "much" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with Father.
It was hard to know him.
They never saw his face, but his voice only heard, "Look up with the voice.
Leave your sister in silence.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My elderly brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already raised when I was a child, went with him into the kidneys and talked about things like the form of the bird glass or the niceness of a cricket shot.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner that read the magazine.
Recently, Henry opened a guitary in Dudley, and despite the conditions are better than in the days of his father, he won an intelligence in how life was like to be for him.
It's now something better, but they're dark, trembling, deep labyrinthe with flames and smoke and a lot of rush.
My father was earlier in the wanne, and then he was able to hear quietly how he began to sing because he was able to cut off the whistle.
When I went over there, I realized that he had done it for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect was greater than him.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ love.
My father never hurt me, he never said, "I love you."
Once my mother was bad at the end of her life, we start, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop the "I love you"?
Stop hurting me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friendly with French, who was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetes.
That helped her death.
So when I was very, very overwhelmed and showed symptoms of diabetes, my Ar > said "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitnessding and had to make a drastic diet to make the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's anxious.
Nobody wants to eat carotten.
Henry's Kar's change may be shown in elegant, short-sized bart.
Since the critics for his Othello have been relied on him, he is joined by the theater.
It followed the commodity of mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is another experience than the Sitcoms and the comedians who have exercised his job life.
He started with only 16 years when he was in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the bowl when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career started in the middle of the seventy years. "I was for a pretty long time of the only black imitator/comedian in television."
He learned in the profession.
I had not only to become big in the eyes of the public but also learned how I could become an ef ef ef ef effort-what's talking machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a easy interview program in which the people "swarmly switched", Henry took up his comedy over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wanted that it would never be done, but I don't cry that I did it.
It was a fair, unappreciative position for me, but I was with riesen projects and learned how to walk with a large public.
But this "year-old easily price-coreed chair of the British television" was also a "great parody of black people".
Through the introduction of figures that the British Black Culture split as well as celebrated, Henry in the eightty-years on an alternative comic circuit.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went in 1984 to send, and in the ninety-year-olds he was amongst the kitchen chief Gareth Blacklock in the Commissary Chef!
Review, documentary films, TV series, and film rolls expressed his next year, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like you just bring the time out or get a little on the place."
Afterward, a documentary for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first result was about Shakespeare.
At Shakespeare, I was regularly allergic.
I had never learned something right about him in the school, and I held him greatly for a dominant of the Media Class, white in the streamfhoses and a coal head in front of it.
So I had a big time before it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try.
Don't hurt if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in the mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so.
Henry led 20 lines from Othello's last talk for the documentary movie and was amazed.
I felt that I could do it.
It was almost like someone had finally put my head right.
"This is why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, search a little.
The tests were brutal, and I read this track for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just didn't work.
And soon he arose in the commodity of mistakes.
Once I was in the National Theater, I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed yourself."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinct that he had to talk to the public.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to overcome 10 minutes while they repair the computer."
Instead, the leader announced that the idea continued when the problem was solved.
I went from the bowne and said something in me, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for it.
I can leave someone else.
"You're playing in a theater piece, so stay in the role."
Henry in Fences the Duchess Theatre
Teaching the text for Fences was appealing.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the minds.
It also came well, so it's like a great gun of the gods who say to me, "This is your decree."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNENT vote.
So I'm staying there.
I really love that.
I love being in a test room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our talk is of humorous explosions, while he still imitates people again.
I have decided to do no stand-up-comedy because I think that this kind of satisfaction is somehow worthless foreigners.
If you always look for this, you'll go to a wall.
Sometimes I am living in Apollo when I like it, but all of it isn't so much as before.
I'm asking him if he's gonna make a stand-up comeditur again.
The pleasure I have in a room with a ruler who helps to form a beginning, a center and the end of a travel - I don't think I'm going to give it again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be a watch player.
It's fun.
You're always talking about a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebells block roads in Jemen's main city
In the conflict between the Skitish Huthi rebels and the Jemenic Government, Huthis called to civilly obedient in Sanaaa.
Huthi attachers had occupied central roads in Sanaaa on Monday, a speaker of the Huthi party said "Ansar God".
The movement to Parliament has also been blocked.
Jemenic media report from a ver·shaos in the main city.
According to the online output of the journal "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday.
Huthi, according to the information of the sheet with another scale of the conflict, should not be complied with its requests.
The Skitish Huthis fighted for more independence from the Sunday Jemen and requested the return of the Government.
The peoples of Huthi have been in the Jemenic capital since nearly two weeks.
300,000 rebels have created protest camps on the large road of Sanaaa.
In the surrounding area, there are still bloody fights with the Jemenish army.
Kenia registered officers to invoke "Western employees"
Kenia began to register all State officers biometricly to remove "gester employees" from the Government's content lists.
Workers who would not be registered in the next two weeks would not be paid anymore was a government communication.
The Government believes that thousands of persons also receive payments from the public service after their derogation.
President Uhuru Kenyatta speak by Office Access 2013 to combat corruption in the public service.
At the beginning of this year, a review was found that at least 1 million dollars (700,000 £) per month of payments for "hearted" and other disadvantaged financial practices were lost.
The Government believes that holders are continued to be paid on accounts after a person died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebus, reports to the BBC from the capital city Nairobi.
All employees must now appear in the next two weeks of Implementation in order to ensure that their data on the biological registrations are recorded in a government report.
Everyone who would not be dismissed without a believed excuse from the holding list continued the communication.
"In this process, it is essentially to racionalize the public service by determining the actual number of employees, and also the list of maintenance at both government levels - so the "gester employees" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Department for Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal about the Artist Council Helge Achenbach is first negotiated before the court on 11 November.
Five inheritance of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the Aldi-Grunder Theo Albrecht, requests in a civil process at Düsseldorfer Landgericht 19.4 million of euros of Achenbach and two of his enterprises in the In-process.
This shared a judge on Monday.
The complaint says that Achenbach was involved in the acquisition of artworks and oldtimes and Berthold Albrechte as actually paid purchase prices.
This is also a result of the agreed provision.
Acenbach has reached 121 million euro values for Albania.
Children need roots and flights
44 years of school, 23 of them as school leader.
Since this time, Manfred judges know many Petershausenians and Kollbachers from that time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always attempted to see people in the schooler.
The snowhead is the most low mountain of the riceberg.
Manfred Judger lies the community with the motive from his home.
The judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
With 14 years, he was interested in school for the teacher.
One year later, the Suded Indians were united.
A half hour the family had to leave her home.
After a few months in a camp in 1946, it went to Bayern - in the good car.
That's how the judge was destroyed in the overflow sneakdorf.
The teacher was found in Bamberg.
Manfred judges had to run six times a week to the next bathroom, with the train to Bamberg, three miles away from the whole city to school and evening.
After two months, Manfred judge in a Red Cross House in Bamberg received an opportunity to sleep: together with up to 15 students in a sleeping room.
In 1951, he made the first and after three years the second State exam.
Since the surface had no free teacher office for him, he went to overbayers and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Froulein Room" was his first "building" in the school house.
In 1958, he had a three-country service in the new building teacher house near the school.
This house bought Manfred Judger 1980 after the school was solved in Kollbach 1968.
To that end, there were three classes in Kollbach in the College of Petershausen-Collbach, and in Petershausen five.
Since 1968/69, these were gathered in Petershausen in the present rathaus.
When the Indersdorf band was founded, only the basic school remained in the place.
In order to escape in the smaller school, the director Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld and Manfred Judge became his follower.
However, Petershausen grows and thus the children and their teachers were able to draw up today’s building, which was extended in 1997 after the judge’s pension.
Manfred Judger lo日 the uncomplicated majority of the former citizen Ludwig Göttz, who was in the same time building a workspace on the community and in the 1997 extension of the Cellerspaces, although it was not acceptable in accordance with the school building directives.
"Master of citizens God was very friendly," the judge said thankful.
In his entire car, Manfred Judge never forgets the contribution of a Governing Board who had responded to a reference to a school Council on the right and justice: "Man can never forget love." Manfred judged put about what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You must give the children twofold: roots and flights," says the 84-year-old.
And he had to know, "It doesn't always feel." If he only mentions his own six children, he's not completely clear.
In any case, judges were sometimes unconventional.
When students were disappointed, they did not have a punishing work from him, nor were they deceived for the neighborhood.
On the costs of the community, judges had made two box box hands and allowed the two contractors to join one another, even if there should be a box once.
To the well-school, judges as a director had a relationship with the daily citizen Ludwig Göttz (CSU).
This moved the partialised judge after his pension to candidate at least 1996 in the CSU list for the community index.
But the judge was chosen at six places and the CSU was assisted.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 carriers insert in the Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten Interstops
When radlers rash on their tour in Bad Salzausen or shotten, it is nothing to be in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of rasts made an impression: the 700 participants of the h4-Radtour and withittross enjoyed a pause in the bottom Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free heavens in the Shottener Alteburg Park.
Under the Motto "Radels and festivals on new discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there a concert of Van Baker & Band miterle.
On Friday, it was serious: The radlers took the first step, 60 km over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continued to attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the sporters of citizens Hans-Peter Seum, who was joined in Bad Vilbel with the train road, and welcomed the leader of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh the body and the spirit, all were prepared for good things: The landscapes from Ranstadt and Nether-Mockstadt had 85 Bleche apfel-, Swedish-, Streusel- and Case-Cooks, which purchased beautifully the windful radlers.
"Such kitchens can only back landscapes," a participant from Olendiebach louded while he ordered another piece.
In the tree state of the Turn-Get-Nidda tourship, cold updates could be made.
The "Duo Bravo" interviewed the melodians with operates and musicals and enjoyed an amazing applause.
The beautiful environment of the park worked relaxingly.
A gentleman also enjoyed a headmassage of his partner: "He has deserved it, and he has repeatedly fixed the driving rows that are already split today."
Therefore, the citizens and the business leader had to work: they were interviewed at the source before the drink course of reporter Ra日 Janke, and used the opportunity to get in the Bad Salzhausen radio.
In addition, Head of Promotion Tobias Hagen, since the first H4-Radtour 2004 as tourist, was able to break shortly, but he had richly to do with the technology in place.
His Pickup-track, in which he communicated through three phones and a radio device with his employees and the 15 buying engine staff of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants comes from the Rhein-Main Room," he said, "although also from gibs or Fulda, from La'bach or tounus and even from many cities in Westfalen are trained by radiators.
The number of participants is a bit of the overnight capabilities available.
In Category I, the participants are subject to hotels, in category II, in collection facilities.
From the Kurort, the radlers had a good impression when they left again after a half hour: "Thoy!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzausen!" They wringed to abschied.
After the arrival in shots, the group was able to set a short breakdown.
But at evening the radlers were requested in the Idyl Alteburg Park.
Under the region of the Schottener Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS) the park had received a beautiful festival and, of course, were prepared leckery, including flame kitchen with well-coated feed white.
Master Susanne Schaab, GTS Business Leader Markus Hoßfeld and MSC president Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as a representative member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed them.
The three were obviously satisfied with the "smoking operation in shots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the dancebounds free.
The opportunity to junction the free sky has been easily enough, despite the sports performance on the road.
Under the guests, citizens, who were acted by the good vote, were as well as the great skars of the railways.
On the second day, the radar carriers were the Star Birstein, the guardbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the trainwalds - on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 km of Radelns, the sporters returned to Bad Wilbel.
Duty of Turkish police arrested against the Government because of the "subjudation"
In Turkey, in total, 33 policies were arrested because of the decree of the "subjudation against the Government", local media agencies reported.
The police members did not give a direct comment.
In the prisoners, there are 14 high-range police officers, reports Hürriet Daily News.
Some of them were shared in corruption investigations against government workers, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they appeared to have found a organized criminal association and have called telephone numbers.
The Turkish president Recept Tayyip Erdogan (the first minister) described its actions as part of the Aées, which were stated by the Islamic Church Fethulla G ́en against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer party.
This day is traditionally a important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenie Jazen holds his daughter in school.
There he shared journalists expecting that not all schools had opened again that he had decided to defend the country for future generations:
The festivals were not held in each school in September.
The sky is not peaceful over all the Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a large Ucrainian community front, has to fight for a peaceful heaven.
Alexan Pastukhow, school leader in Slawjansk, visiting Jazen’s daughter, spoke on Russian.
We hope that here finally is peace again and that the children receive a education that will be useful for them in their lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally trained, with the kids covered, holding ballons in their hands and providing their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she had.
It comes to a proud refrigerator from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has his own front drive.
Their cars began to change them to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearson.
She was president of the Financial Times for seven years and returned when the main posts of the mother company Pearson went to a younger men's colleagues.
Their detention was about 1 million £.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, the former president of the BP, as he looked for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she was borrowed to the cabinet.
Your husband is a former Tory Council member.
In May, I have described the task of the President with a deteriorated chair.
Not only the BBC is as a big and complex unit in the heart of the public life, but there is also a internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence works in two directions: inside the first garden of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concerns and injuries when things run wrong.
This provides a nearly untainable duopol, which requires a complete reform.
But the newly coming president would risk it to reach, to put on everything and to take a institution, which is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may take itself for his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if it wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status.
As the competition is closer and threatening new technologies of old, comfortable security, the current negotiation of license fees for the BBC is linked to special arrangements.
For the low amount of 145,50 £ per year, the British public is purchased into the most safe media companies of the world.
The BBC tells a story: she says she reaches 96% of all households and costs only 40 pences per day.
And it seems that the BBC is growing up at the population scale: 53 Pro ́ they are understood today, compared to 31 Pro® 10 years ago.
The view and use habits for the BBC have changed: I get news lines on my phone and see lost programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very loved and careful institution.
She enjoyed a careful president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that the subsequent Tweet was not authorised
A twoth of the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a subsequent comment on the Democracy Circuit State Affairs, which is in the middle of a criminal accusation against him for the misuse of the office.
The Tweet was deleted later and replaced by another Perrys User account, which replaces the previous.
I've already sent a twoth from my account, which was not authorised by me.
"I don't care about the Tweet and have removed it," he said in the later message.
Perry's workers did not answer immediately on requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perrys of the user's account went out, it was not clear who actually uses the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfruitful picture of the surrounding state advocate of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was condemned in April 2013 for the beverage of tax.
Perry introduced a Veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to return, which could be an accusation against Perry - the possibility of 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury led this month in Austin.
The text of the secondth says, "I don't always drink with the three-timely authorised alcohol level... but if I do it, I claim to the Governor Perry when he broadcast it."
I'm the most drunk democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not undertaken by the leadership of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special state advocate from San Antonio, selected by a Republican judge.
Perry's planning on not guilty and the accusation called a political trick.
His high-class team of legal aids requested the judge who believed in the case to reject the accusation and argumented that the law, with which the elderly Governor in the history of Texas State, was unconstitutionally diffused.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of State money at the Public Integrity Unit of the State - which is in Travis County and is found in cases of State corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to return.
This Veto offered a public challenge on the left of a Watchdog group.
Perrys of user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed the election assemblies in Iowa during his presidential calendar 2012 as fifth, Perry entered the specule that he would stop by putting a twoth of a photo from him at the joggen near a sea, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains apartments again for "normal"
One of the prominent builders of London indicated that the apartment in South East England was "returned" to normal level.
In the main town, own secrets were deeply desired and an object of great prices, which was motivated by the British Bank to put up the above limits of hypothectic credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, the leader and representative of the high-classic building company Berkeley said on Monday, "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction level since the maximum level of 2013" and fêe that it offers a "stable action environment".
The immobility in London was well set up during the breakfast, since foreign buyers were invoked into the capital city.
According to the catastrophic information, the prices in the city area only increased by 18,5% in the past year, more than the average increase in England and Wales.
The average sales prices in Berkeley's private, price-values and student offers increased about about a fiveth in the past year, and the end of April was about 423.000 £.
However, in the past months, a stronger pond has made the immobilious property in London for foreign buyers less attractive - some of them have also been threatened by the introduction of new immobility taxes and political retorics for a possible "volume tax" before the general elections in May.
In the past week, the London Immobility Maker Foxtons warned that the hypothecical report for April, in which the higher credit payment schemes were presented, would also lead to reduced market growth, as well as on the prices.
New data from England from Monday shows a decrease in the hypotheking authorisation in July, which also indicates that the immobility is coaling.
Hamptions International, another immobiliary agency, corrected its preview for the increase in the immobilious prices in London for 2015 to below 3 Pro > on the basis of a already weak household price.
The volume of transactions in the highest regions of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has returned in the middle of a fourth year, such as the WA Ellis Maker.
However, the desire for a home in the main town for Berkeley is a blessing, since the random amounts for date sales are more than 2,2 billion £.
Mr. Pidgley said: "The request for the proper, well-planed product remained stable in the best places, and as a result, the termination sales also remain stable."
In June, the company reported that there were 3.742 new owners in the year to the end of April - almost a third of the maximum level of 2007 before the crisis.
The annual payment results increased by 40% annually to 280 million £, the volume of 18 billion £ to 1,6 billion per year.
In a monthly notification before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the income for Berkeley in the current year would probably comply with the current market expectations.
The analysts evaluate the annual payment result of 450 million £.
Berkeley's actions were fixed at 23,96 £ on the afternoon in London trade.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence emergency at the 85th Oscar delivery.
Naked photos of Oscar Pricemaker Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of more 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" claimed that the photos of Lawrence were real and claimed the hacker because of "eclatant damage of the speech".
The authorities have been informed and will be followed by all those who continue to post the photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally placed on the photo-sharing page 4chan were likely made by an iCloud online speech system of Apple. The typical "masterlist" of the hacking victim includes the names of Duzens of Women Stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken in our home's private environment years ago - I hope you are so satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the nickclodeonesians "iCarly" and "Victorious" suggests that the photos about pictures of her and the second "These so-called naked images of me are GEFÉLSCHT, people.
Let's go on the start.
Buzzfeed reported the late Sunday that a speaker of the Popstar Ariana Grande declined from her.
Exclusive exhibition from Howard Jacobsons highlighted new Roman about love and the letters "J".
They broke, so they could be described best, they solved quietly like a card that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, stressing, intensive, distant and maybe something shortly.
And then shoot his hand.
He knew quickly.
He was crazy, like in Igel, yes.
The last sacrifice of this poverty was a just starting business that was a lot of promises for a deterioration of the single long-term of his life, and maybe even had brought him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a severe beauty with uncircumcised hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even far off and rather than the port Reuben.
She came with an elderly leadership to the south, holding the kevern for her tits, and who had a basic piece in a flighting but paradise valley with the name of Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had been in the house.
The rocks were nice, in the boats were still spices, naked knifes left their tracks on all windows and believed that they belonged to all these things, and the garden was watched with uncraft, which seemed like great coal heads.
It was like the house from a child's season, both threatening and disturbing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose Roman "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Price 2014.
The Short list will be given in the next week.
Kevern had seated with Ailinn handsomely on the broken beds in the high grass and enjoyed an unusual warm wedding afternoon. Both had been stucked in the service console that provided the country with comforting music and insatisfactory news when the view of their crossed breuned legs reminded him of a longly forgotten black entertainer who was pleased to leave his father at closed members in the house.
Your feet's too big.
Because of their urgency aggressiveness, songs of this kind have no longer been played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was so prohibited - just not played.
It was obsoleted as obsoleted by the word.
The general shark created what had never created claims and rules, and as people in books, the Vom-Tellerwesher-Zum-Millionary Memories, Cookbooks and loves-romanes, they chose the ballades in the music.
In the Euphorie of the day Kevern started playing a imaginary clavier and hanging in a grob-commical Serenade Ailinn's big feet.
Ailin didn't understand that.
"It was a song of a Jazzpianist named Fats Waller," he explained her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That was what his father always did to stop the letter J before he came out of the mouth.
It was like a game between him and Father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he told him.
If you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers on your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game at that time, and it wasn't very funny now.
He knew this was expected by him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard anybody.
Jazz was not played, even though he was not directly banned.
Improvization was no longer modern.
It was just a place for one "wen" in life.
People wanted to be absolutely sure where they would end at the beginning of a melodie.
Like the understanding.
His invisibleness made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically excited.
Although he was 10 years old, without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain that Fats Waller was black.
In her age, she was probably not able to remind herself of a time when the pops were not black.
Again, no laws or complaints.
A conform society means that each element of this society was acceptable to the principle of the grouping event - thankful as those sent by the Shick Hall.
People with afro-caribbean origin were suitable through temperament and body building for interview and sport, so they sang and tried.
People originating from Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were subjected to the task to ensure that no family remained without a functional service phone.
Whatever remains from the Polish Community, it was concerned about the channelisation; what was left by the Greek, Teller was destroyed.
Those from the Golf States and the lives whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WAS GESCHEHEN WAR, WENN ES GESCHEHEN WAR had occurred from fear of being accused of fires, even because of fear that the flames would devour them as the next - had opened Labneh and Shisha-Phoefe restaurants, remembered and were depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone after his ability.
Since she only heard ballouds, Ailinn was hard to understand how the wise words that the kevers had just offered her could ever be destroyed.
Music was the expression of love.
"They're not really smart," Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never hated anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the deceased garden gave him the triggerous feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the shadow of the big cold sheets.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he refused to put two fingers back in her present.
She just thought he was something able.
"It looks funny," he said instead.
She unbelievingly shot her head and locked the face of Kevers.
There was nothing to see throughout the world than your unusual black hair.
There was nothing he wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean it without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're supposed to me.
They looked honestly concerned.
Is my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Your feet's not so directly.
Maybe your neck, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my kids are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your deep kids are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried.
I'm a little crazy there.
It doesn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be curious, he often felt in difficulties because he as his father did not overcome the famous charm that was needed to take into account the inherent graveness in the knowledge.
Maybe his father wanted to be gracious too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose up from his chair, threw the console and cut off the wine they had drinked.
Holunderblood wine, so drinking wasn't excuse for him.
In their accuracy, they seemed to swim, like a palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel perverse to you," she said...
Except that I am not.
She regreted him, both because of the unnecessary unnecessaryness of his words and the fear that she had shown in her eyes when she rejected him.
Did she think he would shoot her?
She didn't tell him about life on the cold northern archipel where she was wakened, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same big and ice cold ocean is here as it is on the porch.
The same confused men, with even more distressed skin and more disgusting after DEM WAS GESCHEHEN WAR when their dreams were as smugglers and strangers, of kneipe to Kneipe, always ready to lift up the hand against a woman who refused or hurt them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown you a fucking fashion if she didn't look up!
She's just kitchen - Knutski was the most common word used for a erotic relationship between men and women, an opposite to the unseen loving ballades from the console - they're just kissing and then shooting.
As Kever's view, this was an unnecessary defect, since the Knutsch even represented a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her body.
He arose out of the bed as an old man.
She also felt surprised, but the growth of her worse surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They didn't know.
She looked at him how he was away - as from a room in the top stone she told her companion with him - a man, charged by something that he himself had been thrown up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, despite some had lifted up their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, lifted up his back, seized, without fighting spirit - why was that a view that she seemed to know well if she couldn't even remember at one time when she had seen something like that before this day?
When she was alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
A few years ago, the exactly stated preventions of Esme Nusswood, a intelligent and pleasant 32-year researcher in Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for the public vote, in a short proposal on the continued violence at low and medium level in the countries where their reduction, if not, was expected to be most expected, in view of the money and energy invested in the elimination of this violence.
"It has already been done much, and much has to be done," she wrote, "to encourage the native aggressiveness of a people that has led thousands of wars and has won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet spirit of human friendship has been historically seen despite the highly asked church turms between the hakes.
But some of the properties seem to be unroodable.
Whatever the churchturm, it seems to be reduced by the suffering he continues to wake up.
The population weeps when listening to emotional ballouds, reveals stories about overwhelming difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the trends of marriage and family life, but not only the former silence holds the rural communities as our stateholders fixed in the hand, but there are also claims to stand a new and sustainable conflict at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the game fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to transfer," she mentor said when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less Romans.
Esme Nuss Tree cut her head.
I also need to ask, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," answered Esme Nuss Tree.
Are you lesbian?
Repeat Esme on its right to the points and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Repeat weight.
"I don't ask this," said Luther Rabinowitz s日, "for I would be against Atheism, Lesbentum or Feminism.
This is a prejudicial free job.
We serve a free prejudicial society.
But some kinds of hyperactivity that are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy can sometimes deteriorate results as you have presented them.
Of course, they themselves have advantages against the church, and these things that you face as "interessant" and "roh" could be interpreted by others as well as the expression of a natural power and vitality.
If you continue on the road, WHAT IS THIS, IS THAT IS IS IS IS IS IS IS IS IS IS IS THAT AND THAT would happen last night, it would mean to take the country its essential life force.
Esme Nuss Tree looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
The back of the head repeated the advice that Ofnow had granted to the country in the last four hundred or longer.
Remember your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to Ballade, visit Musicals, use your phone, speak, declare, listen, vote, apologize.
Speaking is better than weaknesses, the song word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely, once you want out," Esme Nusswood answered with a stronger voice when she was sure that her representative had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing else than that we are not so effectively healed as we form ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may find out how we repeat the mistakes that are in the first place to you that we have done the same.
But this time, there are not the others in which we have abandoned our wounds and disbeliefs.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramide with his hands.
In order to deal with an English patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "if you're doing acts as "faults" that maybe have done our grandparents or not.
They also go too far if you're talking about that they would have abandoned their "wut" and their "founds" to "Others".
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak not of "uns" and "others".
There was no "we" and there was no other."
It was a time of the injustice, that's all we know.
"On the one, if we are honest to ourselves," Esme expected to buy, "no part of the society can claim to have been a good behavior.
I'm not complaining anyone.
If it has been done bad or good what happened, it has happened.
That was the time.
It doesn't have to be said anymore - we're agreed.
And just as no fault has to be assigned, there is no debt to be denied if such a grant would be fitted and if it was given a way to touch them.
But what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past serves that we forget them.
If I can say something about it -
Luther Rabinowitz left his piramides together.
"I'll remember her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as habitually, she was transferred by a motor radiator, who, as passengers described, was driven into a kind of "brutal wound" on the road.
There are cases.
Lesotho Military Member states that no State trip has been planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military officer in Lesotho strive to have planned a government road and said that they had passed against cops with which the weapons of political fanatics would be used.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled out of the country and shared that the army of the country circumcided his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
The Premier held his family in the southern African border after he had reported about the threats of attacks.
Military speaker Ntle Ntoi said that there was no state trial, but the military reacted to the threat of "political fanatics" whose weapons were intended by the police.
"What happened to morning was that the staff of the defence forces of Lesotho acted after he received several secret services reports that in the police were acting some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, partipolitical young fanatics who were shortly before it, were to be warmly damage," he said against Voice of America.
The South African Government speaker Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a turnover.
"And if no one claims to have the government through violence, all reports agree that the Assets of the Defence Force of Lesotho show signs for a State trial," he said.
The soldiers of the military officer of Lesotho shared Sunday that the soldiers would return to their casses and the situation in the main city was hard.
In the meantime, Vicepremier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government management during Thaban's affair.
Thabane shared that he believed that he was a goal because of his trial to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, since June, there were great spending after Thabane issues of Parliament's meetings on the basis of the disruptions in its unity government.
He said that his actions would not have determined the government, otherwise sounding accusations to despite.
Production in the euro zone on a 13-month depth
The increase in the production in the Eurozone was delayed in August to the lowest point of the last 13 months, such as a precise observation.
The final market index of the manufacturing cargo manager (PMI) came to 50.7 in August, after a position of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 indicates an expansion.
New tasks returned, and factories experienced increasing spending between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The numbers shall be taken before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The bank's markets expects a clear plan for a long-term recovery of the euro zone and for the slow deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
Specule is that the leader of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further information during this week if it takes a quantitative easier for the euro zone according to those adopted by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the breathing effects of economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for the manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientists on the market.
The Fabric PMI for Germany, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, fell to the deepest position in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic population of the block, France, the PMI fell at 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
The evidence that growth increases in the key industrial mechanisms of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are also not motivating," said Mr Dobson.
The decline of the industry is probably adequate to the fire of the analysts expecting other monetary or fishing incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the maximum level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, leader expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the index of the producing weapons in the Eurozone of August is that the sector continues."
He adds: "Products in the Eurozone are evidently very difficult now, since the current geopolitical spendings - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase incertitudes in the still weak conditions in many countries.
These increased incertitudes have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and the trust of consumers, and probably lead to some tasks to be repeated or even deteriorated, especially great tasks.
He said that it would "be more likely" that the ECB should introduce a kind of QE, "although we believe that this will be limited."
The year of the survivors of Propertylan: Ten years have passed since the earlier place of schools, as they still suffer today.
For more than 1,000 people of Czech Miles were taken in a school in South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than the help of their children, were killed in the three-day martyry that the world shocked.
We are returned to ́lan to find some of the victims who were deceived to death at the Greuelat in the class room.
Just a year after the divorced place, 334 people died, including 186 children, warned the heavy survivors last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic islamic terrorists children and parents took captivity and killed on 1 September 2004 at the beginning of a new school year, it seemed to be the worst of the wicked.
The tragedy united West and East in Abscheu, and then surprisedly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to ́lan to find some of the victims who were deceived to death at the Greueltat in the class room.
We found surprising young people who have overcome the opposite, although the memory of this terrorism has been persecuted forever.
Your biggest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in the child as they die -- now finds an end.
The girl that was photographed at the trial to go back to the shooted school sportshalls
She was photographed and famous by the Russian Star Photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried to turn back to the broken school sportshall after a mine was exploded.
V vullig confused Aida looked for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at that time.
My legs were blue.
I stood up and went in to search for my mother again.
A soldier made her safe.
After a series of operations, she felt totally healthy, but last night she said, "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I need to be operated again.
Some granates are still in my knee.
Your goal is now to become dental to help people how you were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she said warmly.
"That's made to me, and that can't be changed.
Once a year, I'm always going to the sportshalls to remind me of the remaining there.
My friends and I try not to talk about the other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmates Dzera Gapoeva were killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed to go to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I end my room and start my car.
I think of a family later.
She says that it will always remain a part of her, although the memory will be more weak every year.
I am glad that many people in the world are still reminded of our fears and we are so thankful for the help we received from people in the United Kingdom and overall.
When I see the photo of myself online, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophes, and that something that doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through the cocktail, thinking his mother is dead
It was his first school day (Russus go to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day belage in his mother's arms Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mommy said to me, I'd have to put me up when there's an explosion, and keep her hand."
After a explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Come on."
Fuller, she could be dead, he fled and looked on the road a young child who was crying, took it by his hand and fled through a bowl.
His father Wladimir, who fell his son outside his arm, said, "They told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara was killed outside and injured in the hospital, on the side of her assuming her son had died.
After her reconciliation, she said, "I weep for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He went in and hurted me.
There later were logs to London (of the news of the world in the middlely resolved news) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's champion from the Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop the warning," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it's gonna be in my memory.
I'm still sure I've removed all my game pistols right after.
But now I can play computer games with shoes and this is not a problem for me.
"I don't have to go back to the sportshalls, but I don't think of myself.
I am reminded of these children with whom I played in the court and who did not get it outside.
We never say they were killed or killed.
We're saying they're staying in the sportshall.
I remember very well my journey to London, especially the game load, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the journey in a busy car.
But now he has been in place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of disaster that he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wanted to stop reminding me of it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer among the wraths," said Da日, last week as volunteer in a closter.
I want to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that they take me next year in school.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed from our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I reminded me of the terrible silence after the campaign, there was just no children who could call and run, and this silence endured many months.
She recalls lively at her travel to London with Da日.
People in London wept when I told our story.
I understand how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her establishment thankful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in Herbst 2004.
I wanted to call Cherie and just say to herself that they've spent 10 years, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how Da and Da and I have helped.
I still remember how Da ́ liked to eat Burschtsch and call all Russian restaurants.
I remember how he was playing with clothers in an aurant, and then he shot with his water pieces on them, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the Britans so voluntaryly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't been better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and people die every day, and I think many children were killed and still killed.
That's exactly like our children.
I think for many of the war there is a part of the news they hear when they are busy or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so triste.
Because it was big and is a very sharp and silent boy, he is not aggressive or whisper.
For example, he does not look for Rache, he is not overwhelmed by the past crimes.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they are sometimes going to the sportshalls and burning down there.
When he was smaller, he was down - I remember how sometimes he put himself on the sofa, the face turned away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued to throw all his weapons and other military games. There is now 17, greater than I, good looking, smart and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on the feet, I looked around, and I looked at the hake around me, with parts of the body around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have been unable to have overlooked.
"I remember that I called him, "They, run, run away," but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it, and he's gone.
And so the life goes, other than the many others, for us.
Georgian Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible image after the belage, became the symbol of the wrath of a man
Trost: Georgij Lyin and his mother Fatima after the campaign 2004, right a picture of Georgia today
His bloodstream face was embraced in his life, while the Czech terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbari of Âlan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had left him for his first school day before she left to bring her older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists struck him, and then my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not alone, there was a whole family of our neighbors, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia could survive.
More closer to this date, it is more difficult to think about it and talk about it.
There is no one day that we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time ago, I mean, it'd happen yesterday, some scenes of these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise it to you.
Intrinsic: The image of Georgian (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was declined as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgia wanted to go to school this day, and he said he wanted to worry about his teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him in television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgian in San Marino.
Georgia doesn't like to see the picture, and it is hidden with us at home in the book record.
I understand this, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain.
Georgia says today, "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People always study such tragedies again and never know the truth.
And now they investigate the disturbance of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how it is possible, for if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing in such a pain.
We need thousands of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years I had a few albums because of the layer, but then it became better.
Later, in 2004, I returned to school and had every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sportshalls when the 1st September gets closer.
I want to give my old childhood tribut.
It's hard for me to go to the sportshall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget, but I'm not injury.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visited a medical school in Wladikawkaz.
I'll be a heartchirurg.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgian Faniew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was captured to the feet of a murderer terrorist
A miracle: Georgian Faniew was captured during the campaign for the feet of a murderer terrorist, but he could survive.
In the currency of the campaign, he was arrested in the sportshall and sat near the bomb firmed at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel it as if it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to FSB as a secret service officer, but this could not be done because of his healthy damage due to the investment.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily handle bad experiences - I need to say that it's not true.
"2006 I'm with psychologists and then feeling something better, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - in the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the sportshall.
I lost the consciousness.
I will never return there again and please don't ask me to show you where I've seen in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Faniew today, with a photo of itself in the hospital after the laptop
My pain is insane, and I bring him with me every day.
My friends know that I don't want to think of it or talk about it, and they never asked me for school.
It's all right.
I should be careful with my hurt knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study the secret service academy of the FSB in Sankt Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have checked my documents, also the medicals, and they have answered that it is impossible.
My second suffering was the animals, so I went to the animal institution.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to kiss".
He said, "I knew I would never report my children about my experiences.
This should not be aware of children, and they should not, of course, be aware of it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is closer.
I'll go to the festivals to remember.
I know Georgia won't go.
It must be much more violent for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited home for him and couldn't help.
I'm so thankful to God that he was returned to me.
It's staying in us.
Georgia is now a wake, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept it if somebody's so unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't share because of knie.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but no sports.
I would say he overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Friends and neighbors were killed at the campaign, and that only strengthens my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and they were more to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could do to me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never have married again.
It is difficult to accept that life continues even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart went into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what happens in the world - wars in other regions.
Why were these people fighting?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can't almost believe it.
We were a friendly country before, how could it be that we were fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and are still killed.
If all of us could take and throw out these rebels as far as possible.
“ Young People, ” 10 / 10
The baby that was so securely taken by a special adjustment command
Reserved: Aljona Tskajewa is made in security by a Russian special adjustment command (left).
She's now (right) and doesn't recall the grass.
The world insisted in 2004 when the baby Aljona was in the arms of a Russian police officer from the campaign of Propertylan.
The terrorists allowed them to go, but in their greedy, they kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year sister Christina and their brother Makhar back in the school sportshall.
Makhar, then three years old, died, but Aljona’s mother and sister died in the murderal.
Her father Russlan was married again, and with his new wife Swetlana, a little girl who called Christina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today age, doesn't remember the place and is attended to a smart and happy girl, say neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both the great children," says a strong friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the reminders that come up with the eighth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 Tips for better subwater photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most precious option is a water-deep point and shoot, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver edition that are both to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras that all are available to a price of under $350.
About the equipment there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a water-deep camera, make sure that the battery and other fats have been closed closely.
Set your camera too on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have the scene and record modes, with which the exposure time is optimized for the damage subwater conditions.
And before you go in, check how depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, other than 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our buyer and the digit camera assessments for original and waterdeep models.
Make multiple records - because many don't go.
Point and shoot cameras have a LCD with which you can compose images, not usually Action cameras.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right image configuration is a happiness.
So you do a lot of records.
If your camera goes through a row mode with a series of records with easily modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the upper area.
The light will be dramaticly worse, as long as you continue to remove from the surface.
If possible, then stay close to the surface if you make records in a pool, a sea or sea.
Thus you can also bring more colours to your photos; if you go deeper, you will see less color.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good Council in the country, but it is more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is especially important if you work with a Action-Cam: These devices often have a fixed white wheel line, which means that you need to closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire image frames.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort who changed things, even in a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As advising anesthesie, he reflected his care of the task to save the disease’s agony as well as the quality of the treatment.
In his patients, as his wife noticed, he was a MI6-cooperator who had to live with the exciting effects of foldings.
Lawson knew the diagnosis and diseases are important to the doctors while the treatments are overwhelmed with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started suffering.
"I haven't felt," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties to get up.
As he struggled with the griplike symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet intolerance.
"I like everything better than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business journey for a week, Lawson felt unusual and unusually disappointed.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to make an exam of his breast.
First two weeks ago, he was in the French alpes.
The result of the rounding investigation was proposed.
He lied to Mesotheliom, an unhealable cancer, which attacks the brushfell, so the skin that is transferred to the longs.
Like most cancer diseases, the precise solution is most difficult to decide.
For example, a few fucking fucking cancers were not all long cancer diseases before smoking.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the exposer is an asbest charge - contact with the fascinating substance, which once as "wonderful substance" has been recognized as deathly.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbest is a product of the past.
The most earlier asbest type was used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s as the industry was voluntary to not use it anymore.
Moreover, where he was still used, only people in certain branches are directly with the substance - climpner, building workers, roomholders and workers.
As a industrial substance from another time, it seems to be a little worried today.
But this self-compliance is uncomfortable.
Great Britain, so it seems to take up today the height point of a Mesolthelium epidemy.
There are more deaths through Mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2.500 deaths per year, as many people die in this disease as in accidents of injury.
Year numbers of cases of meotheliom death since 1980 and future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we have experienced the death effects now, although asbest has been illegal for years (1999, all types of asbest were prohibited), is that a mesotheliom has developed only after years.
And the grass of Mesotheliom is not limited to the former workers of the building.
Asbest was, and it is still still in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the business in which we purchase.
So Mesotheliom doesn't know class diseases, financial limits, beauty or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant purchases in London to school, are not a protection room.
The Parliament's buildings are as best asking.
Moreover, in the hospitals where we are to be healthy, we have already been designed as a shepherd of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't even a climb.
In fact, he was hard to imagine where he might have come to contact with asbest.
Then he found it out.
"It seems like in the Tunnels at Guy's hospital, where I had six years of exhibition of my education, there was a lot of asbest." he wrote.
All - Students, hospitals, doctors and Pfortners - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my elderly partners will suffer in the same illness?
Of course, he could answer at least partly.
"On the four doctors who were trained at Guy's hospital and who were sick in Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I'm the last one that still lies."
How many of us will be ill?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was decreased in 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It was an unusual long survival.
Fifty Pro ́ all meothelio diagnosed diseases die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The illness always ends deathly.
So we can only ask Lawsons, "How many of us will be ill?"
The main British expert at Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, accepts that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestepidemia in the United Kingdom is probably going to come to survive, the total of 90,000 of the disease will be victim.
Most of these do not know at the moment that they will die so.

A short core on the acts of the courts, to which the persons often turn to because of the damage needs, shows how far the head of the Mesotheliom has already been spread.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, told Janice Allen to have driven asbest.
She had nine years for the Kette, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing division at two places - one of the flagshipstors in the Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when they started their activities at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twelve.
"Before this thing," she said, "I never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even know anything about asbest.
I'd never thought it would be about me once.
There are only few people who know much about asbest.
The fact is that the term Asbest is not a substance but a group of six minerals.
The name refers to the word "abestiform", a description of the fisherstruct, which makes the substance resistable and flexible.
Three of the six were used in building.
Chrysotil, even as white asbest, is today the most common asbest found in buildings.
It was used for dach plates, footplates, rohrisol, boiler isolations, even for breaming in cars.
It is less mortal than other asbest forms, however, the EU and the WHO are viewed as a "great health risk" with the possibility of death.
However, more dangerous is the brune asbest (Amosit) and the blue asbest (crokydolith).
Greece was one of the worldwide importers of green asbest, and experts believed that "the clear, but indirekte evidence of this was a key reason for the only high meotheliom rates."
A worker of Marks & Spencer was assigned in the Flagshipstor in the Oxford Street, London, asbest Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their story is not unusual.
He has presented a range of those concerned, which is shown that "a significant part of the meotheliome without exhibition by work or at home has been caused by asbest contacts in the environment."
A majority of these contacts discusses its statement after the "normal use and age" of our buildings.
It seems like no one can get out of it to be safe.
A report of Goddard Consulting, who has investigated the Westminster Palace, shows how people could have been uncertainly exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
2009 Goddard reported that services and road guides were tryed behind the Parliament's Committees with asbest, whose death fascinatings could be affected by something such a hurtless as "stark air movements".
Parliamentary members often are accused to take care of their own interests, but this looks like the opposite.
As the Directorate of the Parliamentary Working Service pointed out that the Westminster Palace has received a "pure health product", it is also unexpected that 1 billion £ work is needed over several years to renew the Parliament, modernize the electroinstall and remove the asbest, and that, after the general elections of 2015, the lawyers will be in the nearby QE2 conference than on the Green Links in Westminster.
The Goddard report also points out that "the presence of Asbest was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions".
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
Everything you can do now is waiting.
A person who could never determine the contact with asbest is Graham Abbott, a general medicine.
As Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-year-old abode believes that he was exposed to the asbest during his work in hospitals.
"I have been in a hospital, in which the asbest complaint was positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places in which you have made, and the data.
What he still announced is the beginning of December 2009 when he received such a species of fiber.
He was 45, and he just took a operation later at night.
I've had a shot-friend at the end.
It was very suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought the road wasn't going home anymore.
As Ar, Abbott knew that the pains of the brustfell, the skin arose around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to convince a mesotheliom.
He didn't work for a month.
Excellent doctors made his breast rain records and placed Pleurakat or to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the lab.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health was slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after sports processing and intense spirit.
2011, a patient's abbotts came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later met with Mesotheliom.
But now also Abbott doesn't relate to this with its own case.
His patient was a few years old and had directly been with asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's state rebuild, and his householder was able to make his CT scan and rounds into a group of experts.
In December 2011, precisely two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, a soldier with a camera was introduced into the hole between the rip and the brustfell.
I'm a optimist.
I'm doing most of the things simply," he says.
Honestly, I hadn't done so much concern.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsie was suggested in the week between Wednesday and New Year, "Man told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Mesotheliom diagnosis
Later, Abbott had meetings with Macmillan sisters, from whom one recommended him to take a lawyer.
First now he understands the size of the epidemic.
"Asbest was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where Rohre often was isolated with asbest," he said.
The people who were exposed to the asbest in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom is now younger people who haven't been in the typical calls.
The most earlier rubbers with asbestisolation in hospitals were under the ground, so patients were probably not excluded from the substance.
But many employees who changed in footnotes from one building to another (e.g. Andrew Lawson) or in underground cantins (as Graham Abbott often did) were in contact with the most likely toxic substances.
There is evidence that over several years after the war hospitals for the patients were possiblely living, but life threatened for the treated doctors.
He's going to be removed too today.
Schools put their bunsen burners on asbest.
And it's not only about hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, businesses, libraries and town Halls due to his fabulous isolating and flaming characteristics.
Also schools.
In fact, many people have had the first asbest contact in the class room.
Overall in the country, in thousands of chemicals, students have put their bunsen burners on asbestmates.
On web pages, the theme Asbest is now often invited in schools.
And that's why such innocent objects in our homes have contained a standard asbest, such as footplates or shoppings.
"It is a industrial gift that contains large parts of our immobility," notes Andrew Morgan, the legal lawyer, who represented Andrew Lawson in the process against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that included a woman concerned was the disruption of a garden shopping in the 1970s.
So take care of how you broke your garden shops.
The effects of diagnosis, and the effect that the disease is unhealthable, is increasing.
"There's a while to process it," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't do what I did.
I was two weeks in the practice.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience any other Wednesday party.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change from the position of a doctor was to the patient.
As many patients before him, he reminds himself of how overcoming he was of all the information he needed to be corrected.
"It was very hard to get up everything," he said.
"I asked my Ar," how long have I yet?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Yes, I'm not going to experience any other Wednesday Festival.
That was then."
Mesotheliom is especially awesome, because it's our life conservation mechanism - the spirit itself - is that the death cancer causes.
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbest contact.
Asbest consists of smaller fascinations.
When the asbest is inhaled and inhaled, they can be fixed in the breastfell, the skin around the lungs.
Asbest fascinators irritate the brush flock and can solve cell mutation.
"The problem occurs with the inhaled nadel-formed asbest fascinators," thus Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-Thorax Ar, who changed to Guy's hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital from Andrew Lawson believes that it has exposed him to the asbest is now ironic, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some other who were probably also exposed to the asbest during their training in the hospital.
Soon as the asbestnadels reach the long wheat, the treasure says, "they will be made from the breath to the border where the skin is.
From nature it is from the beginning to invasive.
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not work so well in Mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of a operation is heavy.
Some think she's worth a trial.
The treasure denied it.
"You can't cut the bridge out," he said.
You're not coming with the meat.
Because the cancer says "on chemotherapy not very well," the "operation shows", but does not heal.
"There is sometimes long-term survival," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Happily, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis was become a single-man-under-up and advice office for co-contracted.
"Hello, cancer center," he was glad when calling.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had his diagnosis 4 years ago and was still very active.
Evidently, abbott six chemotherapy cycles were offered, which would prolong his life only for a month.
"I was dismissed," he said.
I wanted to leave.
However, Lawson made it "laying things in a little more positive light."
After advice of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, the heart-Thorax specialist at Guy's Guy.
"We had an advantage that I had not to be rejected, I just called and received an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient should receive a transfer and have to wait for the authorisation of the treatment.
The money is decided for meotheliom diseases in order to observe the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail unrepentantly, many people are concerned about another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the judges in the hope of disgrace.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan by Field Fisher Waterhouse 日P.
"It's since 1898 that Asbest is extremely careful for health," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very small burden also represented a health risk.
And here the successfulness of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital contributed to their case s≤, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "complete repayment" because Lawson was not able to prove with absolute security that his mesotheliom was brought back to a asbest contact at Guy's.
After the investigation of the death, however, a guy's speaker said that "the asbest fascinators were removed in the area concerned in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbest can be removed
In fact, it is for meotheliom diseases who are trying to divorce a huge problem to arrange the death asbest contact of a company or a workplace - usually a year after the events.
Their former employees have been locked or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who strive against disputes know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the claimers.
As a reaction to this year, there were clear new laws that make it easier for meotheliom businesses to complain a denunciation, even though their former employees have no longer been found.
The Law has established a 350 million £ fund promoted by the insurance industry for all who have been organized after July 2012 can prove a contact, but no one can reject.
In these cases, the complainant 80% receives what a court in a normal damage process would have been able to speak to them - approximately 120,000 £.
Approximately 300 requests for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many meotheliom businesses that 350 million £ represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a share of insurers for insurers," he says, "and notes that this sum is about a quarter of what the insurers had to kill, if the time had not gone over and the meotheliom diseases could find the enterprises and they could normally regret.
Along with Mike Penning, the Minister for Work and Pension, told that the law was "no perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan indicated that seven death victims every day needed a quick action.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Geettes in December of the past year.
At that time Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski since 19 months.
Following their first consultations, Long-Lazdunski recommended a operation from which he expected a positive effect, in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by a street and chemotherapy - a three-fold treatment with the long lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years from up to 40%.
Abbott felt strong.
"It's of course with the most important," says Abbott.
You always see that again in patients.
There's something that allows you to continue.
If you're leaving, you're far worse.
Graham Abbott submitted the operation in March 2012.
Finally, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind himself.
Narsorcans showed no signs of illness.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer flows around my breast.
I just got 50.
That's not life threatening.
That's the end of life.
Abbott was again undergoing six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no more track of the tumor visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very stressing.
You must think of practical things - about the money if I'm not anymore, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setup works.
If you get bad messages, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it is not always easy.
"For parents, it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a illness with which I wouldn't be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very friendly and unclean.
She told her friends and soon we received a lot of calls.
Ellie was back.
She didn't say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients need to pass through.
But for memothelious diseases such talks are not of hope, not of a trace of hope to survive.
The disease (as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings angry security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not living threatening.
Inbalsamed Pharaons' body developed in asbest clothing
Asbest fascinators used for strengthening costs and for greater heatability.
Plinius of the elderly described asbest.
It was developed a weight that is not burnable.
I've seen the service at the festivals in the rocks.
The use of the modern commercial asbest begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (a.k.a. moneys) and substances.
Important asbestmins are opened in Canada and South Africa and then shortly in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal isolation substance for the damp machines and turbines of the industrial revolution.
The global asbest production increases more than 30,000 tonnes per year.
Proudential statistics identify a timely death rates for those who work with asbest, and they do not receive life insurance anymore.
Nellie Kershaw is in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke states that asbest parts in the Lunge "without every reasonable doubt are the main causes of death."
This is the first case of this kind.
Kershaws worker, Turner Bros Asbestos, doesn't take capture.
It's not paid to damage.
During the second World War, intensive ships are built, one of the most deadly devices with asbest contact.
Voluntary spending of branch on imports of blue asbest
A professional court shall comply with the first person's replacement of damage in the United Kingdom for contact with asbest.
The global asbest production increases more than 4.213.000 tonnes per year.
United Kingdom imports 139.000 tonnes.
A health and security sequence in the United Kingdom commits all companies working with asbest to be licensed.
Imports and use of blue and green asbest are legally prohibited in Greece.
Any use of asbest is prohibited in the United Kingdom.
The Mesotheliom legislation is dismissed in Greece.
A repayment programme of 350 million £ is announced.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but white asbest continues to be used as a precious building material in many countries of the earth.
The world production is about 2 million tonnes a year.
China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swearing payment
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament disappeared despite the increased call after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections 2017 by the Hong Kong election.
This procedure probably supports the long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while the activists led the planning and mobilization to the way within few hours after the confidence.
The decision of the Chinese Popular Congress allows the communist leaders fundamentally to reject non-peking trusted candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us woe," said legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
You've been angry with the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritary regime.
In its defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vizegeneral Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotical".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom returned the Hong Kong control to the Chinese, Peking promised to allow the residents to choose the Governing Presidency since 2017.
The Chinese leader represented the decision from Sunday as a democracy, because there is a direct election to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also indicates that the Chinese leader holds the exit by a strong controlled Nomination County of Peking.
After a new clausel, only candidates should be allowed "with love for land and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the most active and public Protests in Hong Kong have been located for several years.
After the Prodemokratic campaign in Hong Kong, Occupy Central with Love and Peace, whose organisations have threatened to break the financial visit if Peking does not allow real general election.
On Sunday, hundreds of Occupy-center attackers in the rain before the Government Fourth in Hong Kong were gathered within a few hours after the confidence.
In the demonstration, the organisations said that their movement has reached a new level of civil unrighteousness and they plant protests in the next weeks.
However, they did not make any more information to avoid problems with the authorities.
In a online communication, the organisations shared that the movement "the maintenance of the central district has only been considered as the last funds, a action that should only be placed when all dialogue chances are designed and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all dialogue chances have been created and the detention of the central district will be definitively placed.
The authorities in Hongkong have been prepared for the announcement of Pekings since days, and it has increased security measures on Sunday before the Government building. Police officers and barricades.
The disasters are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they lose the control of their city.
The movement of humans from the firm country enhances competition for products and services.
The fear that the values of Hong Kong such as democracy and freedom under the growing pressure of Pekings begin to break.
Some criticized the demonstration of the Occupy Central Movement, since they had the business operation - the living seed of Hong Kongs.
"The protests of which they are talking could create great economic damage, after how many have been shared in it and how long they are walking," said legal expert Regine Ip, which has criticized the movement for a long time.
We don't want to warn that Hong Kong does without control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The Stately controlled Chinese media reported recently to the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents in Western powers.
In this summer, activists organized an inofficial referencendum to the rights of the elections in which 780,000 people participated - more than one five of the electors in Hong Kong.
In July, ten thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school closing sites in the United States is now to the universities over, where Freshmen is offered with the aircraft.
We are pleased to respond to this question and to offer the first luxuous travel service of the United Kingdom for students today.
To achieve a particularly impressive approach to the university, the company also offers transport options such as flights, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, otherwise, have to cut their happiness in an approximately overloaded car through the country.
As well as our new VIF options, we are happy to ensure that the students receive the university with a minimum advantage and a maximum of Luxus.
A company speaker said that no new bookings have yet been proposed, since the service was just introduced, but it would be said that "Studiers would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also shared that, despite the debt of 9.000 £ per year, a market was expected for this boat.
Students today are very different in their expectations and suggestions from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can exactly do this.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as a rejection.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for High School, said: "This boat seems to be completely disturbed from the life of most students.
Students who start this month with the lifetime seem to be a crisis of life-keeping costs because the available financial aid in the form of credits and stipendies does not take a strong step in accounts for the most simple life-based foundations before they can generally think to give thousands of pounds for such a simple way as the arrival in the students' home.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hear hands, don't shoot," while they waited before the sepulchre.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the Bloggerin Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in the online discussions of white feminine.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators shall put the sex before the race, in the case of reproduction law and income unbalance.
However, while the spendings in the Middle Western increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women were 100% around the race.
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the shoes of August 9, the personal exay came with titles such as "The thoughts to Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism is not only about the pressure of women".
But for Perez, this means a significant change.
"I don't think you find many people in feminism who are white and speak privacy in such a high-classic way," she said.
People felt pressured to express something about the events.
It is characteristic for the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For the English Professor Coritha Mitchell from the Ohio State, Ferguson had problems in light, which were issued by black Americans every day, but not as "frying themes" in the cultural room.
"I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I put something on how colorful in their own country stands under the campaign, the weak ears are awesome.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public room?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dicotomy between race and sexual problems.
For them, black women did not have the Luxus to separate the subjects clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
Currently white women now connect the subjects of race and sex in the feminist stream circuits, Angela Hattery, Professor for women and sexual research at George Mason, says that their preachers did the opposite.
" between 1865 and 1890 at least 100,000 black men were aligned and the foundation was almost always the administration of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be shared in the story to justify Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the divorce between white and black women came to the point where the white battles for women's choice rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the latest years of the 19th century and found that the battle for election rights could be only a group for each group: women or blazers.
"They met the decision to use women's election rights, and the optional right to swarms should come later," said Hattery.
If you remember such things, one with power will know why white women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to deal with their husbands and sons.
Even after 1920 women received the election right, it was another year until white women were organized against the linchen in the Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was born almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women sides, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions on the questions opened by Ferguson - Police behaviour, racial discrimination - a speed of the time when white femininists played "Fanging" with the problems with which black women have seen each other since generation.
"Will it not be great if the activists who have the right to educate a child so seriously as they do it with the right to capture control?", asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation, which build their cars on the fight against the rights of reproduction and access to prevent receipt, are now trying to understand what that means.
The white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article of Rebecca Carroll, the Columnist of Guardian, where they requested more protests from white Americans to the theme of rassism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand one resident of the body - and the opinions of the race that are clearly different in public issues - will be made the changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem for an easier intersectional feminism, in which race- and sexual themes are called, some of their comments on the race theme in America have been blown.
Christina Sommers, researcher at American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, "which worse than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their former critics.
Now there are hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently had a small program, My Brother's Keeper, made up to help hurt young and spanish men, there were terrible reactions from many feminine stains, including Gloria Steinem.
Police's relationship with the black Community is not the only problem that is involved in the front of the streamfeminist.
After the United States Greence Police has reached nearly 63.000 minors at the southwest border of the country in this year, the subject of immigration reform is to the top area - this time as a female theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-president of We Belong Together, a organization that mobilizes women for the immigration reform, said that for a new consideration of the subject as a significant female theme, she needs to be public only the stories of the immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of the workvisa comes to men's immigrants, the women who join them are in a position where they are attacked for domestic violence and explosion.
"These stories find a neighborhood in women's organizations," she said.

However, the attachment force of the event was strong enough to lock more than 1000 sugars in the morning, who rebelled against the rainwearers and the rainful colds, and allowed the historical speech to restlessly.
There was a bunch of presentations, records, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rheinland.
The main attraction of the day was, of course, the martial warfare troops of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used each rain pause to demonstrate their strong war art.
Gladiator owner Leonidas has shown himself as a humorous and intellectual representative and sent his men to the ring to a strong double fight in various Gladiator offences.
First, the "provocators" were in the row with right-cocked and short-screen and legs on the left leg and arms on the right hand.
It followed the "Esedarie" with brush, short worm and wurflace, as well as the iron gladiator helm, legs and arm protection.
In fact, it was impressive that the arriving of the "retiarius", which was attached with wrf, trizack and dolch against the "secutor" and after short fighting the bursts to the ground.
So the swords strengthened one to another, creating the swords, and the wrfs flood through the Arena that one and a boat could become about the health of the Gladiators.
But on that the impressionant "Summa Rudis", the muscleless shied judge, had always a careful eye.
"We wanted to rescue the Romans all day and make the culture of Rome's time experienced," said Lorenz Euskichen, president of the Act of "Freundes Roman Circle", the intention behind the speech.
After two years of preparation, a "oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, such as Vizeburger Master Wehage in Gruß, was established from the free time park for a day.
The Romans have not only brought war and recovery to our region, but also the Roman culture and many buildings that we are still wondering today.
The rest of these were also to be assessed at the Roman day, approximately "Aquadukt-Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Channel Bridges, which were only at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society agreed with the water and energy supply and now, and business leader Petra Fricke knew, "We are still benefiting from that time."
This also provides Diplom Measurement Engineer Ralph Sainter from the "IngenieurTwo" from Rheinbach, the Romans' mixing instruments such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Romervilla in Blakenheim presented skices and models from the excavations in 1894, as well as the steel stones from the original hypocaust, the warm fluid teasing, which at the same time heated the Romervilla.

A constitutional wall of a economic building was found with a dark to throw fruit and milk.
The building probably heard of a Villa Rustica, a agricultural good, presented the Archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of funds from these excavations presented it in a glassvitrine, including a large tail, a number of fine glass feet and parts of a circle.
The Villa has already existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the Germans in the Roman Roman Rheinland arrived at that time.
The children also worked with the Roman winter game, similar to today’s mixture game, or they write their names as the Roman students with metal grills on rocks.
In the state of the Roman Term Zeltpich, the children of Mosaiken were able to place themselves, to boast in the position of the Glasmuse ́ Rheinbach glassmosaiken and in the condition of the nature of the egg Netersheim a severe wheel from stone to meat the meal for a flood bread or a muscle.
With the original road cars built by two cold flowers, the Roman road cars passed through the free time park and came to the impressive position of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the assembly of Watchberg will also be introduced in the 2014 Romanian year called in the Rheinland, which will be reminded of Caiser Augustus' death 2000 years ago.

Ebola: The Epidemie is the West African economy
Ebola epidemia in Western Africa is also a serious struggle for the economic.
Markets are dismissed - and international enterprises go to distance.
The evolving Ebola epidemic is a serious struggle in West Africa's economy.
The harvests are devastated on the fields that the mines have left and the markets have disappeared - the virus has made the region hard.
Some international enterprises are already remote.
"The Ebola epidemia is not only a medical crisis but also a economic," judges the Chief of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is affected by herotic tests
"It's a total disastrous, we lose very much money," Alhaji Bamogo said, "which was on the second largest market in Liberia's main city of Monrovia.
On the market only comes who wants to buy food or something to defection against Ebola.
Liberia was found at the most heavy of the virus, only here the fiber fell over 600 people to sacrifice.
Recently, the health staff explained that the disease is in every angle of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria have spread the virus.
In total, more than 1500 people have died, and thousands of others have died.
External firms remove employees
Undertakings shall place their operation everywhere in the resource-related countries.
Foreign companies, such as the Arcelor Mittal staff, dismiss their employees, several international aircraft companies are no longer engaged in the regions concerned.
Also, the inhabitants and builders react: only a few buyers left their homeworkers to take care of afternoon.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarters, including the important cacao and coffee bones in the fields for export.
The builders don't want to leave their home for the harvests.
Food become button
"The people will always be less traveling," says Phillip De Vreyer, Pariser expert for the West African economy.
For example, the man, who usually goes to the market and grows his trees, is better to stay home.
The population, therefore, is to observe the impacts of the epidemic directly and urgently: food will be shortly.
On the markets, the foreground of basic feeding materials like rice.
On the other hand, the strong region depending on international enterprises causes an image shame - with a largely low effect.
The greatest is that international enterprises are based on the area for long time, says Philippe Hugon from French Tank Iris.
Determining how far and how long the virus will be spread.
In investors, the impression can be found, "that it is appropriate to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest", advises Hugon.
The illness is also charged by the disappeared state debt of the States.
The illness is also charged by the straped state costs of the States concerned.
The Moody's Rating Agency ensures that their budgets are strongly straped from the higher issues for the health system and often by the harmful economy.
The African Development Bank has already spoken to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million (45 million euros).
The effects are also evident in Nigeria, where only few Ebola cases have been reported.
The oil region in the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
However, otherwise, many people have already stayed home before an injury.
Also reservations in hotels are clearly returned.

After a work of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988, Pfarrer Strassers for the new rooms gave the church blessing.
One of the big height points in the story was certainly the 44th holiday, related to the festival of the new shops in July 1991.

Now the officer is clear about it again.
But it is not a free letter for all complex details.
CSU seems to be aware of hard-deep thoughts from the CDU against the Pkw wall.
Angela Merkel has spoken a power to introduce a Pkw wall.
"To say it clearly: she is in the Coalition Treaty, and she will come," the partyfine said on Monday after meetings of the CDU spectacular organs in Berlin.
On a detailed model, however, the label was not set first.
In the Black-Red Government Programme, "specific parameters" are called.
Mr Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal and will now continue".

Genetic disorder often wrong
One Britin says she thought she would die as a result of a failure diagnose for many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the faith that she had only a few years to live after she had been infected with another disease.
She was actually in the Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited smittings that damage the nerves outside the brain and the backmark.
Charity CMT UK shared that failure diagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because it is so little about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor screens such as muscle weights, an unsecure way and coated teas.
Patients also suffer to immorality feelings or pain. The disease is unhealthable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with the time.
When Rodgers 13 was, she believed she suffered from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the chair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who were 51 years old today said, "All the child knew that I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I've always fallen, and I've been able to stay with me longer.
I was never able to drive with the other children Rollschuh or Skateboard and was often rejected in school because of my kind of course.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 years after several operations, she agreed to deload her sons of Achille and stretch their feet when her Ar had left the room and read that she was in FA.
"I felt guilty because I was nervous, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looking for illness in the library and writing to the FA-Gesellship," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked, and I was looking forward to panic.
I thought I'd be in the roll chair with 18 and die with 25, and I'd lose all my abilities quietly.
I did all this alone with me and planted my own funeral.
She said, when she became 17, she realized that her abilities had not taken so strongly as she had presented it and asked her architecture.
He just stood up, and he hurt me and said, "My love, I don't think you'd have it, else you'd be in the chair."
I think you've got something less threatening to life.
After some genetic tests, CMT was found.
"If he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT-awareness moon to take care of this disease.
Stabsfieldwebbel a. Berni Diether 日 since the closement of the former tropical workplace as fireworker
Since almost 10 years, there is no longer been shot on the former tropical station in monkeys.
Nevertheless, every month the murdering munition is still in the heart of the biosphäre area Sweebische Alb.
The granates are sometimes so careful that they need to be cut off from the place.
A earnest-speaking knock takes place in the streams over the heart piece of the biospher area.
In December 2004, the last scarce shot fell on the town of Münsingen, which was closed after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares of the large area is the nuclear part of the biosphäre area Schwebische Alb, which is opened on 13 ways for wanderers and radiators.
The tax charge of business loans in Washington room increases with economic recovery
A recurring of the economic means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means taxes.
State and local tax collections for companies in the country were easily increased in the last year, while the economic recovery was reduced, such a new public period last week, and the companies in Washington room did not constitute any exception.
Company in the Room District, Maryland and Virginia together paid 27.6 billion dollars to State and local institutions in the financial year 2013, increased by 3.8 per per cent against 2012 income by 26.6 billion dollars.
The State and local tax charge of the enterprises increased by $671 billion in the past year, compared to $3,9 billion in the previous year, and it was the growth year after the several years of decade 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than the local taxes, by 4,3 Pro, as the tax group carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the State Tax Centre.
More than the half of the tax income in the district, 56 Pro, is from business taxes, while 36% of Marylands income from companies.
Virginia gets the lowest tax incomes from companies with 28 Pro.
A majority of the growth in tax income is based on the recovery of the immobility values of the enterprises, the researchers say, which leaded to an increase in immobilious taxes by 3.7% in this year after the following three years with growth rates of less than 1%.
A large part of these wins from large states such as California, New York and Texas seems to be reached to the Washington room.
Company in the district, Maryland and Virginia together paid over 10 billion dollars to State and local immobility taxes in the past year, compared to 9.6 billion dollars 2012 - a growth during a year of 4.2 Pro.
However, the apparent recovery of immobility values in Maryland is not so effective in the increase of State and local tax income, since the immobilious taxes are at least more than one fifth of the tax collectors of companies.
Company in Virginia and D.C. are almost the help of their State and local taxes in the form of immobilious taxes.
"In Maryland the following is: a large part of the immobility, especially in the tax area of D.C., is either in possession of the Government or of non-profit organisations which do not pay immobility taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, business leader of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to leave more income taxes, for example, to provide the same services offered by other States.
The latest recovery of tax income by companies cannot only be revoked for the recovery of the immobility.
Company income also seems to be recovered as the data.
Company in the region reported income taxes in State organizations of $2,3 billion in comparison to $2,1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in business income taxes, the maximum amount of the region.
As the trend goes to the same direction, the local tax charge for companies does not increase at all three places.
The increase rate in the district corresponded to 4.3 Pro > the national average, while the growth in Maryland was clear, 4.9 Pro.
Only Virginia reported a average tax income of 4,1 Pro.
Virginia, with 6 Pro · in all three officials, has clearly lowest enterprise taxes (in all three, there are fixed enterprise taxes).
The company's tax in Maryland is 8.25% and in the district is relatively high in 9.975 Pro.
A comparative range of the US Handling Chamber at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower State and local enterprise taxes are required and a better tax climate is in total than in Maryland.
In the area, the district was not investigated.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is pressured by his south neighbors.
North Carolina has decreased the laws for the deduction of its taxes in this year from 6,9 Pro ́ to 6 Pro ́, the same set as Virginia, and the set will be decreased to 5 Pro ́ in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income objectives in the next year, this law could reduce the income tax of the State until 2017 to 3 Pro.
In the meantime, it seems to be better going to the small carriers in Washington room, and thus they kill more state and local taxes as the youngest.
Company taxes paid as individual income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure after which the majority of small enterprises are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia have increased 20 per cent in the past year to $2.4 billion, a clearer growth rates than the company taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and growth of business taxes in the whole country will be probably stopped in this year, with an increase in the general multilateral tax income for the State and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 in comparison to the same period of the previous year.
However, the room of Washington could hinder if the decreasing of the Federal Government affects the work in the region.
Partner City: Germany Bier for Guangzhou
Hope and malz - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent call in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a bridegroom and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, built in Frankfurt Partnerstadt Guangzhou - so is the triggering desire of the officiels in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would be left in our town," said the Vice-Parteise Secretary of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, this week at a SPD delegation in his city.
The functionary of the Governing Communist Party of China has always returned to this assignment of the 12 million Metropoles.
Guangzhou, who is also called Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities of China, warb Li.
Thus, people also have the purchasing force to be able to make the German beer.
The Hessian SPD President Thorsten Schäfer-Gumbel, who led the German delegation, told the guest provider that he will be in Germany as a possible partner for the project.
"For beer it doesn't take much: water, feed and life pleasure," he added at the midday with the party in Guangzhou.
This enjoyment of life has already been dismissed by Mr. Li, and he has dismissed the guest.
Then the functionary of Guangzhou with shepherd rubber - but with red wine served to eat.
The Chinese mark Tsingtao returns to German Braukunst.
Tsingtao beer is born after the German purity offer.
More business traffic
A second desire of the Chinese guest provider would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Partchef Li.
The airhansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012, it was for economic reasons.
"It would be recompensed," the Communal Policy was convinced.
"The business traffic between our two cities continues."
Currently, travelers should take the road over Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li claimed.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose main city is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The Vice Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, presented this desire in front of the social democrats.
"This is a very much idea," answered shepherd-Gumbel - the Chinese Viceminister Li Jinjun, an intimate identifier of Germany.
Employed Partnership
Guangzhou's vice-party manager hopes that he can visit Frankfurt in the next year to a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on , but not yet in this function.
He came to the office first in this year after his prosecutors were transported from the office for corruption.
Moreover, the local party officer Wan Qinglian had to go.
The action against the functionaries of Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is implemented by the Governing Boss Xi Jin.
Li Yiwei's new Supplement Policy had made before his partner an ananic company, which is most unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Prior access to Guangzhou, he was employed as an officer in Fujian, where the car builder VW created a large work.
Frankfurt has often entered more than a thousand cities partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 miles remote guangzhou belongs to those who are bound by both sides, approximately with a student.
In the past year, the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese Connection was made.
The South Chinese Metropole on Perlfluss is almost as strong as the whole hair with its economic force.
In the next year, it wants to obtain a bruto inland product of 250 billion euros, reported in Li.
Family of Joan Rivers
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her delivery to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter today has been hoped that the 81-year comicer has been recovered from her disease.
"There is for your spiritual love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a communication.
We're all pressing the dooms.
According to her mother, sources were delivered on Thursday after an emergency due to heart condition in a clinic at the top East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in the Mount Sinai hospital.
The doctors are determined to be seated and under precise observation until they are more satisfied with their status, which continues to be described as "earlier".
The reactions came from many pages, including in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental dust and growing sales
For cars and stainers coming into trade from today, the environmental standards are available in the future.
Similarly, as cold and wash machines, new dusts get from 1 September to a label where the buyer can find a low central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the "Euro 6" class applies to higher values of oxide oxide.
▪ There are more money for the builders: they receive a totally united minimum loan of 10,25 euros.
Amazon purchases Twi €1,04 billion
AMAZON also worked out what information had reported on Monday morning: The online single handheld - and videoproduction, and a number of other things - buying the video streaming service Twi for $1,04 billion (970 million US$).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one expected a Twi, but because it was overwhelmed that YouTube would purchase the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twi's to Google's video service for a cool billion, and the cooperation also appears naturally.
Twi, which was founded first three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was fast to a platform for players who wanted to publish their goods in games, a "YouTube for live games", such a inside.
The two interfaces.
And "let's play", a video genre in which the best wizard gives the games (the most older) an attractive of mysterious scientist theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is also that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twi, so the message that YouTube Twi wanted to buy, to record something nice, an example of teacher book of a established technology company, which would produce a potential competitor.
It is a reason why the deal with YouTube did not stand because the company was ready to buy reports as much as Amazon.
All that we know at the moment is this statement of Emmet Shear, President of Twi®: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us reach faster dorthin."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twi.
For Snobs like me, who claim that they are better attracted than to see it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes out to see others when playing, even take the control console in hand.
It's a thing to look at a friend at 3 a.m. tomorrow, while it sleeps through the resident Evil, and something else to see a spinner, how he will be shot 20 times in the Call of Duty in the head.
All these games you could see right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego games, so the survey without self-control on the check-spectives can be a correct recept for head pain.
I admit that the crowds in which the Roger Bannisters of our Electronic Age are aware of all games in record time.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtues, his twi channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do the skeptics know like I'm already?
Twi ́ is called by 55 million different sugars per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet transport speeds.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make it money?
It is difficult to imagine that Twi faces so elegant in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twi could simply slightly.
But Twi own has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who will be approved as newspapers.
As the president of Twi, Shear, said, Amazon and Twi ́ believe both in the future of the Gaming, and the media does not show any signs of a breakdown, not even - slucck - as a viewport.
At the hopfburg at the Garden Fest, some of them were left on Sunday.
The concept of the acters was true.
Despite the powerful rainhouse on Saturday, 1200 music fans came to the open-Air Fest in Burggarten.
In time, the income had to be arrested.
"This was terrible," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Max Sachraj and Ron Sem have designed the name Aula.
Because the open air in the salt garden will strike light day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the pleasure comes from alone.
This was already shown in the early Sunday, when the first suppers were opened to the Open Air.
A festival for all generations had spoken the organizers.
And that's what they learned.
As regards the conditions of supply on the garden wheel, saltwedelers, but also guests from the nearest and further environment.
They followed the first live reliefs, wiped with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cold tree - short: clean rest and enjoyed.
And that's great through the Genre.
Since one on the covered white sand was stuck at the strangerbar, others labed on a fourth wine in the Vinothek, the neighborhood on the Hüpfburg, which was a great point of attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when the child is born, the volunteer helpers in the true sense of the word had all the hands to do to become the Lord of Andrang and to put fantasy creation into the small faces.
The sizes used the kickertic or shared in a skateboard workhop, which the Goodfoot Craw was designed from saltwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30, he claimed to the sugars below, especially families seeking wheat and drunkness.
But the Attra's Festival did not break this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sam, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
Therefore, a repeat of the great party has not occurred in the next year.
Although the content and size of the event must be held still, Sam made clear in a first bi-day on Sunday against the people's voice.
As a terrible, he claimed that the admission had to be arrested at the time.
Obviously, the security pharmaceutical was used with too few powers.
The consequence: Some who had already paid no longer came to the land.
The resonance was very good.
In a first spectacular seat, the salt-weather Mitezzator spoke of about 1200 clusters who were in the garden of the village.
There were problems in the tone technology.
The saltwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks'nRox'n't disturbs their adventure.
The technicians were not able to create a half-reaching sound.
The scheduled Shisha-Lounges could not be built because the circles were not able to be brought to salt wheel because of a roof.
"They will be with the next year," as the agent.
The premium of the Amul-Open Airs was more than learned from the sugar numbers.
And that in bad weather.
However, the events have made some errors that will be misleaded for the first time, but they must be removed at the second place.
Also in the social Facebook network, the events have to criticize.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you have just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event site.
"It's sorry that you've got a little to you," El roomman says at the same place.
Others do not see the starting problems so hard.
I think it's very good that some are not just stupid, but really try to put something on the feet.
Shut off!", writes Stephanie Jentz to amul.
Now the meetings remain a year to delay these critical points.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's waremarks shot
It is not expected to be like that.
Moreover, the prepared building is expected to be used in the marking building work.
The action is in the context of a greater measure: almost 50 years after the TIRA World Survey Radar is renewed completely.
The new radom will be somewhat smaller than the older with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But the size still remains well-treeord.
The last step to complete the new row is the chapter exchange
The opposite quarter of the old hole is cut off and taken with a crown.
Then the last quarter of the new bottle will be set up.
If the time is playing, the action will go over the bounce at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket Calenge makes kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom cried so much when her easy water was shot over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge was painful.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had shot so much at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she was pulling the kitchen.
Isabelle Roberts from British crossed so much as her easily calm water was shot over her head that she hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I was doing, my kitchen was just standing," she said to the Mirror.
Iron water is cut over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before accident
I wanted to shut my mouth, but that wasn't what the kiefer was shot, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw it, and they were almost laughing in the house, but I had to go into the record.
The 20-year-olds from Britain were delivered to the hospital in order to restore the kiefer after having participated in the viral trend on Sunday.
The Clip was linked to a Internet sensation and thousands of times to Facebook and Twitter.
Are the villages back on a street soon?
There was always twist between the two Wolfrates Houses.
Now the events think of a possible cooperation.
As an example of the rebuilding of the Wolfrate Houses Burg, the murdered Richard Dimbath, former president of the Wolffrauser Burg Friend, introduced the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no climate between the Burgverein and the Friendly Wolfrate House.
It seemed that the positions of the story of the Wolfratshueser Burg and a possible rebuilding were different.
Now the two layers are moved to each other: talks should be made soon on a joint action.
This is what the constitutions of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burg friends) visit on the request of our magazine.
"I've called Mr. Piffl and proposed that we should be able to gather together once," reports Sjöberg.
See the view of all members of both unions may be able to return to a straight again.
So it is more rapidly visible to make sure that it is.
Since the neighbors had a rebuilding of the village at the mountainwald in the eye of the neighborhood, the "Exclusion and experience" of the land is the first place for the village for Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second president of the citizens, has been very pleased by its own information on the call.
Since Dibath's death, he is present to the neighborhood.
A new president will be found in a assembly of members in mid September.
Currently, the United is counted by the 74-year-olds around 40 members.
"By the death of my friend Richard Dibath, we have left the conferences from respect to it." This "denkphase" was needed to "to imagine how it could go."
Piffl says that the new president will then go to the conference with the municipality.
To this end, the citizens could also make a current voting picture within their grouping.
A candidate for the president is still not available, says Piffl.
"But I am convinced that someone will find it." He himself doesn't want to candidate because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfrate House.
The talenter wants to work on the project, but it is very pleasant to continue.
The different positions in the rebuilding things will remain in the eyes of Piffls next time.
He deserves Dibath as a missionary, who always believed in the rebuilding of the village.
Two similar, long-term projects in Austria and France would show that this idea has not been completed.
By a high share of the population and by voluntary assistants from all the world, they are a tourist magnetic.
Piffl: "I was also skeptic at the beginning.
But in the course of the time, I have become more and more convinced that it is important to advance the project.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU advice, sugar tickets and potential sponsors, I believe Piffl.
"The idea of the rebuilding I wouldn't personally go over the board." He hopes that the bourgeois may be moved in this point.
Their goal to document the story once, "is important and good."
Then you could continue to look at it.
Claire ways to save at Uni Teacher Books
Since the costs for university teachers for many students are more than $1,000 per year, the student Matt Schro met a clearer Sparidee.
He experienced a body system for books of students of semester and invited a nominal demand to delay the return.
"My Mathebook costs usually $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-box," said Schro; 19, who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have made him $430, he said.
He gave 120 dollars.
The college leader shared the students in the average more than $00 per year for teacher books and materials, but there are different cost-approval options for students.
Online leafs and creative approaches such as the crops are at least the solution of choice for students.
The middle of teachers will be popular, and thus students can use a book a semester long, often to a clearer price than to buy.
Neebo Inc, which included more than 250 university books, shared that the mixture of text books has doubled since 2011.
Question in the Branche shows that about a quarter of books was mixed in the college books in the past year, Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than the help of all teacher books are covered in Campus books, according to the statement of the Trade Association National Equipment of College Stores.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price for which they are in campus booking.
The nineth of "Calculus" from Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler cost almost $290, but it can be used for $239,99 in the specialized teacher Chegg.com.
Buy Used
If any of the notes of other or normal use tracks doesn't make anything, books are used to be an option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at the Briigham Young, says he issued on Amazon.com 42 Cents for a useful series of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business".
The book was newly baptized for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, leader of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether previous issues were allowed.
Sometimes the updates for seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure may often be made for a fraction of the costs for the latest expenditure.
Outside Chegg and Amazon is also half.com of eBay Inc a popular alternative for used books.
Middle
The middle of teachers is worth a review if you are sometimes treating them well, thinking of returning them and you don't want to keep the books after the course is closed.
You can save more than 80% of the costs of a newly bought book.
For example, a student could pay "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for approximately 20 dollars.
Inform the provisions of your business, including the penalties which, for example, fall to the writing of notes, underlines or use tracks.
Meeter adjusted: If you don't return the book, the criminals can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
Also E-Books place of originating teacher books are a option.
Sometimes these books are de facto mixed by providing a electronic licence for a certain period of major handlers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc...
In Chegg, you can pay "Calculus" for 6 months for approximately 61 dollars.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classics today can be downloaded freely, while scientific and engineering teachers can be very higher.
Look at any case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be visited in the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price fixing in books, since you can be so sure to find the right teacher book.
And before a online order you should check, so Gault, if the book is actually ready.
This lesson he learned from the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and paid s^ the full price in the college booking.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" hasn't become a coach
"The Expendables 3" by Silvester Stallone played less than 30 millions of his 90 million budgets in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" was just 12 million of his budget of 70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" attached to Cameron Diaz played only 14,6 million in the weekend, while children's movies such as "Easy Drenken Teeth 2" were also discovered at the income.
A article of the telegraph film criticer Robbie Collin states that in the children's lack of quality in the movies itself can be the reason.
Collin used 2014 as "the worst year" for children films and described "Draven teeth made easily 2" as a pure "functional" Fantasy continuation.
However, in films for a little older target group, it seems like the quality of the films is not the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compares the average cinemaScore and Metacritic assessment for each sommer film starting between the Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and the current year of at least 2000 lining winters.
The results are the opinion of the Chinese visitors and film critics and indicate that the annual films are equal to those of the past year.
Some commentators believe that the development of changed view habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Regisseur Jon Favreau, currently appearing on Disneys, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the time changes."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak casen results of Hollywood productions, the networkflix at the latest reached the streaming contents of 1,2 billion, almost doubled as in the past year, in which the range was 837 million.
In the last summer, the director Steven Gameberg criticized the film studies that they were too much on comic films and prophesied a "knock" Hollywoods.
In the light of the present divorce, some commentators argues that his dark prophecy can contain a true nuclear.
As a result of the potential casen shots expected in Summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are optimistic:
The product of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline of the cassen results recently as simple "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the greatest summer at the kinocasse, and no one will worry about the business."
When a few years ago the 2th Tushennis Beach Class has been executed to punish the League Department, it was a step to the right direction.
Now the German Tishennis link has adopted an additional 3. Bundesliga programme.
The following: Whoever is not raised has gone away.
Thus, the highest class team of Godingen Torpedo in the Oberliga Religiation has avoided the decline, but in the coming season only plays fifth class.
Classically, Torpedos ladies remain, despite their great transmarches in the regional liga.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Netherachsenliga, as the boys of the SC Wee.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserves are attached to the new banding liga, and there are no gods in the country.
The ladies play the TTV Geismar in the Foreign, the Torpedo-Twide in the Landsliga.
What from the composition seems to be a better circuit class is now the new surrounding south.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Inbeck, Hammenstedt, above SV, Langenhouse, FC Weser and the TTC.
In the districts, they are played as regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Vende, in the Class of TTC II, Red white, above SV II and the team of the TTV Geismar II and III. At least the ladies' circles start in Soutforce.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Tourpedo III and Satten Houses/WO marshauses run.
With your nine men
The SC Wende sends his girls to the small beach.
Moreover, the SCW youth's circuit staff - there is still starting Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a circuit class, Geismar, Tuspo Weing and the above SV are going to the season.
At the first season of the newly founded region association, the two gods' circles start with nine communities.
In the Western staff, the red-white II, above SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grene, Dransfelders SC II, Milehouse and SG Langlern II.
In the East Staff, including sattenhouses/W'marshausen, Nikolausberg and landolfshausen.
The Lady-Chrisliga consists of sattenhouses/W’marshausen II, Bilhausen, Hemel, Seulingen II, Tuspo Wende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circuit of Osterode, where there are no ladies teams anymore on circle levels.
Remembering that no one of the six two Crystals reaches the Summary, the innovative and enveloped circles will have to be thought once.
Nato-Gipfel: First Protest in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend, there were protests of enemies of the Nato-Gipfels in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered themselves in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato-March.

The demonstrators call for the retreat of the Governing Boss, which they prejudice to the election deficiency.
The police shared, about a miles from the residence of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it was returned to meetings of approximately 3000 demonstrants with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital statements, a police officer was lost.
At the week, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were hurt when demonstrators tried to prevent Sharif's residence.
They call for the retreat of the President.
The strong military called on Sunday after a meeting in the military capital quarter to a political solution of the conflict, "disusping without time and use without violence".
It also said: "The Army remains obligated to ensure the security of the State."
The escaliating violence has threatened against an intervention of the military, which has already been more frequently in the past.
The protests indicated by the Opposition Policy Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have been held since the 14 August.
Sharif refuses to get back.
Khan and Qadri called their attachments on Sunday to endure.
"We will not return without Sharif forced to return," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similar.
Khan proposes Sharif to have won the parliamentary choice in May last year.
Qadri requests the retreat of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the election system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use in order to deal with the government quarter.
The demonstrators had soon endured peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri invited them to attend Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Shotball Dorfers after second seasonary in three places of the table.
With the 2:0 over gracious, for Rapid, a bitter week on Sunday ended.
"The victory is very free," said Tra≤ Zoran Barisic, whose team with the outside in Europe League had reached an intermediately on Thursday.
"The successful life was unsecretly important," occupied Captain and Tors Steffen Hofmann, who proposed three places with green-white.
Rapid has shown the right reaction with the second seasonary on the destruction of Helsinki, and he goes with a successful life in the country game-pause.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outside-defensed Thomas Schramel, who, with a glorious führ ́s-Volley from the sixth corner in the 14th minute, set the weaks on you.
"I thought I'd put the whole fruit into the Thursday and shoot it under the late," said the 26-year-old laughing.
As the break on November 13, 2010, the last time in a Federal Legislative Party, it was still for Ried.
That is why the first mastership street in the Rapid Road will remain in a special memory.
"For me, it's something very special, I'm out of the Rapid Neighborhood," she said.
Because of the short-term becken-Blesur of Mario Pavelic, the left to the right defensive side was cut off and made his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this spectacular position.
The gate he deserved, he has done some asistents today," loving Barisic.
Manage shows Character Schrame also offered the Flague to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which made the decision.
Because the guests could also be written before that.
"God, thank you, we have had something lucky geha today," also observed a craft that thus played on the exhaustion of performance and results in the last weeks: "The results did not vote, but the player was always good in comparison to the last year."
Barisic even found that you were "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest multitude that played in this season in this stadium".
Thus, since 26 July, the first three points have proved that the social addiction has been intaked, despite the facts: "My community has shown today that she has character."
Not less satisfied for him, "With we finally played to zero."
Work during the country's pause In addition to the circumstances that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsbergers are to complain several accidents, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan St; and Philipp Schobesbergers have given their starting debt.
"You can't forget it," murmured Barisic, who lost the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "which were very stable in the past three days."
The country's pause must therefore be used to "leaving wounds and putting a little in the corporate area", said Barisic, who has five U21-emissions in his range.
One who is able to get the pause specially placed is Captain Hofmann.
He's scared for the community, he's over pain.
Just in this serious phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us," stated Barisic.
Hofmann gave the Rapids game before his change in the 68. Minutes not only the structure but also reached the second gate.
For the 33-year-olds, who solved his 350. Bundesliga game, it was the first match from the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "We must not believe that everything is right now" "We must certainly have a little ha ha ha haha, but sometimes the happiness must come back to us.
Now it was the maximum time," Hofmann said.
He urged freely to can’t continue to work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played so bad in the last weeks as it has been shown.
But we should not also believe that everything is right now.
The importance of his role for the team he couldn't fight.
It's a very young community that I can help very much at the moment.
They keep on me in some phases," Hofmann said.
Greedy-Coach Michael Baur had a little to go out and his community.
He endured the quick opposite "from the category of Zaubertor" and the regular gate of use in the 40 minutes, which has been accused of a consequence of unrighteous co-ordinator.
The only proposal I can make the community is that we have not been sufficiently concrete in some phases.
There's too few delays.
Internal defense Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It just started bad, but then we found clean and even made a gate.
In great and whole, there would have been more inside.
Under this wipfel is Ruth
We showed a strong tribe at our cycle of the "My part of the Rainer Happy" in the last Friday.
Many of these trees are still in the country circle, the illustrated example is the "three" above the white brun.
A holprid foot road leads up to the 600-year old eggs.
It's about groups, basal stones and basal stones.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the street to Weisbach, there it is.
Vital looks like the natural memory, it looks out of the other trees of the surrounding area and notes a range of more than eight metres to an ananic mammut tree.
A small Buddha on a bathroom indicates that it is a spiritual or mystery place.
Despite intensive research, however, there were only indications on the origin of the names.
Dr. Wolfgang Sneider consulted extra the Bischofsheimer archive and asked older people from underwhite brun to learn what power it has with the throat.
The results of his investigations remained the very nearest claim for the name.
Therefore, until about 80 years ago, the shepherds of the shepherds must have threw their animals from white brush out to the wheat and have freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animals that are created from the rise must have been equipped.
In the meantime, the area has won its importance, because the shows actually go back to the sheep.
The area has also been explained to the nuclear zone of the biospheren reserve, and Sneider has continued to find out.
However, when the assembly comes, you should be able to take care of, because the basal of the sun washed is also a popular residence place for cross-zotters.
A wanderway leads from white brun to the tree, but something hidden.
Other ways are equipped, the direction is up to higher hand and invites to an expanded wall.
Where's the waterburg?
However, a waterburg looking for our next task is rare to find in the height.
The mirror in the grave is already a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the country, to which the construction conference could match.
Where's our "Free lucky stone"?
My piece of happiness

Following a week after the break, the Italian Premier and official President of the EU, Matteo Renzi, has implemented the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as a leader of the EU foreign policy, it will be followed by Britin Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the nearby Governing Journal La Republic repeat, the vocation of its Mogherini also in the Governing Team as a favorist as a strengthening the position of social democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects an operation for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not lately, Renzi hopes to put the left base back to him hard, because Mogherini is here, even if it is more fittingly - assigned.
In contrast with the conservative representatives of the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the named Poland, Mr Donald Tusk, will be the presidential opinion in Rome in order to make a political compensation.
Because the EU's head diplomatic is at the same time a representative of the Commission President Juncker.
The remaining approval of the EU Parliament shall apply as safe.
Otherwise, the President Giorgio Napolitano would have called the nomination of the 41-year-old Democracy Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Republic has extended the optimism that, since almost two years, the members of the Governing Boards and Mogherini will show the "grong challenges" for their honour.
The gifted Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Their partners started the promoted policy in 1996 in the Juvenile Democratici di Sinistra (Linksdemocrats) organized in 2008 with the Catholic Central Party Margherita to today’s social democratic PD.

Since 2008, she is a member of the Deputy Chamber, in which she is expert for defence and international matters.
When Renzi became Premier in February 2014, he ordered Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with a strong peace movement in the country that has contributed to the over 40% votes of the Partie at the EU Wales in May, then, as noted in PD cities, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The maintenance in Brussels, which the new EU foreign officers have too few diplomatic experiences, thus missing the substance, is included in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular by Poland and the Baltic members, mist-realistic accents Mogherinis are persecuted to the crisis in Ukraine and diffamed as a "Russian friendship".
It provides the Pipeline South Stream of the Russian Gasprom firm to be transported directly to South Europe through the Russian Earth Gas throughout Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi had arrived in July as EU president, Mogherini traveled to its first state visit to Moscow.
Photos that they showed with Putin at Shake hands were included in Brussels with empire, as well as they included the Kreml Chief for October to a Microland economic box.

Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China daily after election decision.
A peking tree group weared the Chinese flag nearly.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Conference adopted a framework law on Sunday which allowed only two or three candidates for the choice in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must, first, provide the majority of the support of a nomination committee, which is probably occupied with peking faithful members.

Putin requested by Kiew to record "State talks" with the Ostukrain
The Russian President Wladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ucrainian government establishes the fight against the separatists in the east of the country and directly takes negotiations on the "State" of the department region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later explained that Putin did not make it clear that it would be a part of Russian region under the control of the separatists, but that its status should be redefinited against Ukraine to give the Russian region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiewer Government to negotiate with the pro-Russian residents has been followed since the first five months ago: aid for separatists to take areas and pressure on the Ucrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossia real independence for a alliance with Russia instead of the west.
In an interview with the public television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the restoration of the areas held by separatists in the regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annuised the Ucrainian Halbinsel Crime on 18 March.
The creml and the separatists have recently used the area as "Novorosia" or "Newsland", a term which refers to the pre-revolutionary time of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who are in the motion of the Ucrainian campaigns for elections on 26 October and during the Governing Groups attacked civilians in the areas held by separatists hope "in their illusions captured" hoped in the Itar tax.
"We must take immediate interviews, not only on technical issues but also on the political organization of the Society and the State of South-East Tucraine, to observe the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to stateness should be seen in the context with the larger autonomy that has been discussed by the Kiewer Führer for months in order to spread care in Russian areas that their cultural and language rights are accurate.
Only the Ucrainian government can distribute the necessary autonomy to the areas, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "for it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but a internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Crawling speaker for the correction of the "fault interpretation" of Putin's comments underlined the Russian leadership in the way of walking with the separatist revolution in the East, rather than the direct annection of the crisis, in which the majority of the 2 million ethnic populations are Russian.
Moscow had much greater difficulties to ignore the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in the Ostkrain, since most of the 6,5 million people were not Russian and asked about a large majority of the residence in Ukraine from the time before the conflict.
The autonomy invited by Russian diplomates on international fores would give the regional governments in Ukraine full power to negotiate their own trade and external relations, so that Kreml de facto provides control over a area connecting the Russian State area to the crisis.
The half annuised five months ago in the Black Sea is the homestaff for the majority of the Russian marine, as well as a major trade sea and historical coast region.
Furthermore, the regions between the Rostow area in Russia and the Crime are rich in mines, manufactures and gitteries, which make important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that the Ukrainian legislation, after new elections, should consider the provisions of the Constitution, with which the areas concerned have a greater control of their financial and the status of languages.
But his imagination of autonomy seems to be in scarce opposite to those of the creml and the separatist rebels whose weapons and upload of Moscow will be provided.
Putin's last invitation to Kiew to negotiate with the separatist leaders on high eyes followed another advantage of the rebels last week after Russian troops and panzers were invoked over the previous peaceful region under the Asian Sea in the Ostkrain.
The separatists supported by Russia have taken in the hands of the Ucrainian security of the first step of a campaign to take the Strategic Coast region to Crime, the control of Nuoasowsk.
Therefore, massive civils and military preparations have been made up to establish a stalk industry of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nuoasowsk and the low access to the half-life of Krim.
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of the EU's flight in Brussels and requested urgent acts to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We're quickly standing before a point where there is no more back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of strangers are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU's rubber did not have concrete action which requested the draft further sanctions against Russia to take into force an unspecified scale of Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to go back from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian panzer colons and 1.000 soldiers entered the Donez region last week to submit the hosted separatisists, Mr Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiew.
The first 63 Ucrainian soldiers, which were included by the Russian attack in Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian fall-screen victims captured a week ago in Ukrainian area, and Lysenko shared on Sunday.
Naktofotoscandal on Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn't make any hair about his harm over hacker, probably the naked images of his loving Gabi Grecko and a Who is the A promise from Hollywood.
The film town is in a cluster after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence has been found in a hacking channel for promis on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for it makes more than 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the songs Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the shower Kirsten Dunst.
From the Australian spectacles Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne also became private photos due to a iCloud luck public.
The list contains 101 Promises.
The most famous who had lost himself with Grecko last month said to the confidential, "It's opposite."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be shooted and transmitted to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reports reported that the hack was "comfortable" and that the subjects felt "will be hurt".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex friend Scott Speedman, including two records where it lies up without a pool.
The Palmers' film work belongs to "Lieve is unsecure" with Liam Hems .
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the browning player from Sucker Punch were not available for comments to the hacked images last night.
A representative Lawrence said to the TMZ: "It's a disgusting damage of the sight."
Seth Rogen convinced the hacker in Tweet: "The hacked images from a phone is nothing other than the sale of Hehlerware."
The pure view should not be tolerated by the continuing broadcast of rounded images.
Radlers, Joggers and Wanderers were at the 8th rows on the Grand Campberg yesterday and thus supported the "Help for Cancer Children".
The tour for which a torture was made a light training for the others.
However, in one, everyone agreed: it was funny.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in life, the head of the surrounding Brauchause was driven to the fieldberg last night.
For the good purpose.
The small muscle cater can easily hide, as well as his participation on the 8th rows on the large fieldberg in favour of the "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) also personally brought a valuable knowledge.
A great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - OK!"
Small wheel on the road in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the opposite city parliament, many of the 718 participants went to the mountains in the morning and came close to the creation, but happy on the platform.
Others, however, it was easier to overcome the good 11 km long streams between Hohemark and fieldberg.
For example, Norman Dietzner.
The whole green politician coming in red from the crostag - red dress, red truck - did on the beginning something on the substatement ("Each multitude of Profis, there's the goal!"), but then showed himself at the mountain as half Profi and went after 45 minutes without athemic goal.
He also passed the streak in a rutch, as well as Nina Kuhn, Presse speaker of the city overursel, who had made himself on the road together with Frank Greeneisen.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg Radeln" was not a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, we're pleased to do with it - we'd have done an outcome today," so coach.
On the road, they met Paul Wenzel from the top-roomberg.
The boy (12) was gone to the top of the morning to stramp back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had spent in the sattel on the morning at 9 hours in the morning, "build" the fieldberg two times to roll then with fun home.
It was fun, too, "free-toni."
Road tours are simply part of the head of the superior Kultkiosks.
He had divided with → 6,5-kil-reinrad 40 minutes.
A foolish event.
For this purpose - I'm pleased to do it," said Andreas Balzke.
The transtrained one says he's a "ambitioned rainradler".
It must also be he, because he was on the "Fixy Council", even though they are raindrids, but without the shipping...
That it also went up without a raw locker, not only the 20 wagers that went up over the white walls and the fucking station, but also a jogger who dropped a car ride behind a cordel.
Bergwater-Ar; Professor Volker Lischke, who was equipped with the team with Allrad-Bully and Quad, for security, said: "They know" from Frankfurt, trained for a special slitter trail, only that he holds the slides himself." So the man is certainly his own slitter.
The 718 participants - and thus so many as never - were sent in groups on the streets on the morning.
The Wanderer first at 9:30.
It followed the first road carriers and lunchers at 10 hours.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bickers left.
Bent Hansen, president of the United 'Radeln on the Great Campberg', gave the start commands and wanted the participant to flee.
For the next year, he hopes that it will be able to lock the streets up to the security of the participants.
