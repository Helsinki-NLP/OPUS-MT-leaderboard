At the end of the exchanges, Prague bascules in the negative
After Wednesday morning, Prague's bubble rectified its losses.
Transactions with CHEZ actions reach almost half of the common daily exchanges.
Thursday, from the beginning of the exchanges, Prague's beach renewed with her fall of the watch, when she lost almost six per cent.
This time, the low is due to the fall of action at Wall Street.
The market's reaction to the result of the vote of the American Representative Room, which will adopt the American Financial Stabilisation Plan, is also perceived by us.
Chute of actions in Asia
Asian bourses were a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indicators succeeded during the day of the loss.
Hung Seng of Hongkong's ship lost four per cent during the exchanges, but later, he removed a part of the losses and reduced the decrease of approximately 2,5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises after the movement of Chinese actions from Hongkong's beach lost 3.8 percent, while markets are closed in Shanghai.
Sydney was lost more than five per cent, but finally we were able to reduce losses to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Bourse lost 3.6 per cent.
"The hesitation on the United States salvation action will affect the world's financial markets," notes Joseph Yam, the chief of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hongkong is a part of China, he himself establishes its monetary policy, which is independent of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American Islators should quickly repeat negotiations and adopt the proposal for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would be undertaken.
The blood bathroom of the United States Actions
Monday, the United States Representative Room rejected the financial system support project, which would have been dedicated to $700 billion (approximately $12 billion Kč).
The Islators thus refused the call to support the draft President George Bush.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the entire economy.
America's actions, on Monday, were a blood bathroom and the main indications of action known as the biggest fall of the last 20 years.
Dow Jones lost nearly seven percent, knowing a fall of such an envergure for the last time in 1987.
The vote was already lost, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was free.
The United States Government can inject $700 billion in the banks
The leaders of the United States Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a larger form of the financial aid agreement to the United States financial system.
It will be submitted to the vote in the beginning of the next week.
The American Islators have made a decisive turning in the talks on the adoption of a safeguard plan in the form of a financial aid of $700 billion (approximately $12 billion) granted to the US financial system.
The success is not so sure.
In fact, before the final version of the Law and submit it to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the Agreement.
The financial system ' s support plan will be examined on Monday at the Representative Room.
On Sunday, the Agency Re Rés Barney Frank, the President of the Committee on the Rules of Regulatory and Financial Regulations of the House.
According to the sources, the plan should be submitted to the vote at the Senat on Thursday.
According to economics, the announcement that the salvation plan will be adopted should be a primary psychological factor to raise the financial markets.
However, since the complexity of the mechanisms that the market aid may be effective, it will follow a "desillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great progress.
We have regulated our different opinions on the form that should have the market stability package," the Democracy Nancy Pelosi confided to the Bloomberg Agency.
It states that the final vote could be made on Sunday.
On Sunday night, representatives of the Islators met the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson in order to give the Government a final form.
This should, with financial companies, refundable immobiliar activity that cause financial undertakings to significant losses and threaten the stability of the system throughout it.
"We are able to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has significant responsibility on the markets of action.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid does not evade the Islators so that the Congrès will reach a final agreement on Sunday.
They thus want to calm investors before the beginning of the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the Congrès decision could be affected on Monday exchanges.
However, it is not possible to make sure when the two American Congress Rooms will be voted or if negotiations are not able to remain locked at the last time by such or such a problem.
The Islators hope that it will be adopted during the future days.
Nevertheless, the law will continue to make changes.
The total amount intended for the system shall be divided into two parties.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if the Congrès has the impression that the programme does not carry out its function, it has the possibility of blocking the allowance of the remaining amount in two steps: over 100 billion additional dollars, then, to end, 350 billion dollars.
Mr Bush welcomed the progress in the negotiations
Although the Chairman may put his view to this decision, the Congrès has the possibility of put it in minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the programme, which consisted of funds for the recovery of bad immobiliary titles, including the value of the catastrophe, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were not able to pay their hypotheches, were maintained.
"All work is done.
The Room of Representatives should be able to proceed on Monday to vote in the Law, and the Sunday,” indicates the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His portfolio Tony Fratto stated that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy".
Restriction of lost parachutes
The Chairman of the Secretary Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, negotiator, states that the Islators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of losers, the derogations agreement, the dealing plan on the time axis.
The new law also intends to restrict these parachutes to the directors of the enterprises involved in the programme and set up a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the fund.
This should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked very hard on the issue and made important progress to an agreement that will walk and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides aid for immobile owners, which have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new complaints in the case of hypotheches she's going to buy, while reducing the debtor's threats and allowing those to keep their homes.
Mark: A Psychological Aid
According to Patria Finance Finance Chief David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its performance will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we ignore what will be the mechanism and the price of the recovery of assets to problems.
This point will be determined to determine the share of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of the next week, it is not, Marek, so important as this.
"It is much more important than congressmen agree since this week that they support this plan and that they will consacre it as soon as possible.
This psychological meaning of the Agreement, which provides the adoption of the plan, is the most important at this point," Mark stressed.
A battle moved to extreme: MP3 players against mobile.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While almost all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It's the result that it's better to buy only a phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons for seeking an independent player.
The choice depends fully on the way of use and requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a nice gamma grammophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, such musical products do not go out on vinyl disc, and, in view of quality, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if there are in your stages of vinyl disks, with rock art, jazz or blue, you dream at least like such a grammophone.
It is similar to music during movements, namely compressed music, to say it simplifiedly - of music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to expenditure eight thousand corners for a player, the same way as a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty supporting listeners bought for twenty corners on the market.
There are two extremes, among which there is enough place for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The lives of the batteries are also decisive
Some high-game music readers are able to have much more things than simply reading music, but it is not known functions, obviously, of most mobiles.
No current device is universal as the phone.
Near the first functions, telephone calls and SMS sending, it is able to read from music and movies, to record these last, to have a different quality camera and, for example, to use the navigation.
And if we take into account the artphones and the scatters, you'll have a small fabriker in your pocket.
Since no fridge can grill the meat and no television will take photographs, we are probably assisting a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not inconvenient.
More the number of functions you use is large, more the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goinfres.
Rare are the mobiles that can read from music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this number is almost lower.
In this regard, music readers (in particular the most rudimentary) are just more perfect.
In the case of good market mobiles, count that they will play music only for a few hours.
If, in addition, you are calling for time in time, look for a second reload for the work - this is valid even for the lovers.
The problem will not be made for MP3 players who can, after a reload, continue to function at least 9 hours, including the less perfect.
Another problem occurs in the recording of music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a USB universal connector, so far as not all can be directly connected to the computer, without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card players know to take it without reduction, given the small sizes of memory cards used in the mobile.
With regard to readers, you do not need, except iPod, any software.
It's enough to fill, through the USB plug-in, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the device, the title of the album, the player, or then the user's judgement.
Some apparatus only show an index with a tree structure, in the way to explore it from Windows, others are able to both (ver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more knowledge
In the choice of a specific device, especially interest in the life of the accumulator, the ability of memory, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the facility of the command.
If the music is for you, mainly, a background sound and in the day you're going to hear that for a limited time, for example, taking the tram, it suffices any mobile reading the MP3.
Practically all mobiles are able today.
You are not even obligated to take too much attention to music formats that the mobile or player can read.
Everyone comes to read the MP3 and the large majority of the music that will reach until you have this format.
It is part of the most extended formats and other than it, the large majority of the devices comes to read also from WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less core.
High gamma mobiles also allow online music buying.
You need to visit, from the mobile phone, the operator's web pages (or the other supplier) and buy the song or album in question.
This service to him alone should constitute a convinced reason to gain a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is dismissable and, in most cases, limits to quickly done radio tubes.
The prices are not even the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way to buy music (which is by GSM, Internet, even through the Internet in the future) will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry their mobile on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you have only to get out the mobile of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have listeners or well a handsfree connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the integrated engines, which have almost all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main benefit of music mobiles is their price.
The less dear costs usually less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand hours, you can have a very convenient walkman.
But in most cases, you will be limited by the absent of output for listeners.
The price of the best phones and best tools, including a input for listeners, is not exceeding fifty thousand.
The readers, however, have the advantage of having a easy order.
Indeed, no one is going to ensure the command of the most rudimentary players - which are not necessarily corresponding to the less lovers (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette, couragely used in the past, or a grammophone, is evident.
There is no risk of risk in the form of a mobile Internet by hasard, followed by a large data transmission factor.
Which device to choose
Even less dear mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a place for exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so later).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand corners.
But take care of it.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the dearest ones even get out with memory cards of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and you still want to buy a good MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or well a iriver.
In accordance with the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not expend more than 1 100 corners.
If you are a part of the most required auditors, please choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are obtained by independent command keys for MP3, and so the command advance is approached to the independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one who went the most far in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (normally 15 hours up to 35 hours), is assured by a MP3 player produced by one of the above marks.
A first operator will win Chechia this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechland is relatively advanced, our operators offering practically the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we miss the same thing — a operator, who would force classic operators to reduce prices.
He may not miss for a long time.
We have already called on the Mobile, at the morning, on the fact that the Czech operators are part of the lovers in Europe.
The CTU (Czech Office of Telecommunications), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, after the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming resources, a paradoxal situation will occur - the SMS sent from the foreign will be for some customers of the Czech mobile operators less lovers than the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czechland remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxal, since we have even three mobile networks and a penetration that exceeds 100%.
In contrast, mobile operators like to claim that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this case, Paul Dvořák, Chairman of the Czech Office of Telecommunications (CTU), who declared several times than in Czechland, there was no more place for another operator, who was curused with operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network appears to have a lot of chance (for now, he would only find difficult frequency).
However, there is another possibility - a operator.
This is just the entry of the operators on the mobile market which has caused a significant decrease of prices, which will then also react to classical operators.
However, before even the income of festival problems such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices like those we hear today were left to hear in Great Britain.
However, it appeared that he stayed from the place for such operators and that they could have a real success.
In addition, we are not obligated to go too far to find examples.
In the month of February, we had informed you about the launch, in Poland, of the Operator Mobilking.
Only six months, this operator has succeeded to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country.
Let us update that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has between others the U:phone in Czechland.
The advantage of operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
To be effective, they actually need many less clients than a classic operator.
In fact, they are relatively high exemptions from building, exploiting and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, the operators profile themselves as lower cost operators - they offer calls and good SMS markets, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile proposes at least two times less than its competitors in Greece.
However, as it shows the example of Mobilking in Poland, a target group can also constitute a good puzzle of publicity.
In fact, this operator specifically shows men.
"The true men choose Mobilking - a operator who pleases and who can trust," said David Seibert, the Mobile Entertainment Company CEO, operating this operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be possible to walk with us too.
Miroslav Čepisk, Vodafone portfolio, of course: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most operators are based.
More than it is relatively saturated from the view of the offer of services."
In Czechland, there is no chance, the mobile operators say
However, it is almost sure that if there will be an operator in Chechia, it will not be Mobilking.
"We discuss the extension of this project to success, but negotiations in Czechland are not very promoting.
Mobilking's launch will be located in other countries in our area," he said in a telephone entrepreneur for Mobile.cz Jana Studičková, a portfolio of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the operators in Czechland were, in any case, not favorable to this idea.
In contrast, they are trying to make their best possible so that a potential competitor can not appear.
The GTS Novera group, who would like to make a new step to become a real competitor of Telephoneika in the area of business customers, does not hide, for a long time, his intention to launch a mobile operator.
"We have much to be able to offer to our customers not only fixed telecommunication services but also mobile.
And the most early will be the best.
We have already conducted negotiations on this opportunity for several times with the encounter of the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we succeeded in negotiations," Paul Kaidl group portfolio said.
So the future may be promising.
According to non-official information, we may be able to accept the first operator since the end of the year.
But for instant, its creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"In this moment, we do not think there is a place on the Czech market for an operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific.
For the moment, no subject of a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Srscheň of the Telephone O2 Press Department said in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile Martina Kemrová portfolio states in a rare sense with the O2: "We haven't recorded for the viable and bilaterally beneficial project instance, which could serve base."
And she says, "It is almost excluded that a operator appears in the T-Mobile network at the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited period, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Instead, Vodafone guides his attention on the fulfillment of requests for its own licence 3G.
Miroslav Čepisk said, "We are open to negotiations with potential operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructures.
That is what, we, mean the most of the advantages of customers' viewpoint.
The main Vodafone strategy in this area is the covering of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile network."
Authorities responsible: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily comprehensible, the introduction of another operator would mean a growth of competition, would have led to a decrease of prices and thus a decrease of their benefit.
What, then, is good to easily easily make such a competitor's event?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to hear as larrons in furnace. The chicane accompanies the creation of the U:phone also shows it.
The most apparent pressure on the CTU, when U:phone was created, was the T-Mobile company exercised.
Provides accessible information to the public from the web pages of the CTU.
Today, the U:phone is ready to use as an argument to not accept an operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition on the mobile market was also recently enhanced by the input on the market of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the character of the RT mobile market, it is evident that the income of an additional player would submit it, and, in particular, to high requirements."
However, since the attitude of mobile operators here is, the inefficace of the Czech regulatory agencies seems disturbing.
However, it is not only the attitude of the CTU, which, contrary to the Great Britain and other developed countries, does not, unfortunately, have the power to intervene in the economic competition in Czechland.
This belongs to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But this last adopted its typical position, faced with this problem.
"The introduction of a mobile operator on the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the operator concerned on the location of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the present time, because the offer of potential interests has not priorily provided sufficient interest for classic operators," said in response to our question Crisian Chalupa of the UOHS foreign relations.
A such statement would not be surprised by the representatives of the operators.
However, one of the offices, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care of, that no one benefits from his position on the market, such a statement is more than deteriorating.
More like Christián Chalupa: "In the foreign, where the operators are usually present, it can be found that their income on the market has contributed to a decrease of the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the sense of honest market functioning and price reduction does not appear to be part of UOHS interests.
What is actually shocking is the nearly touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which results of their reactions.
The question, if it is really a hazard, is naturally.
Similarly, a strictly identical price of the essence to all services stations is probably due to the hazard and hard fight of competition.
"The office has not found signs of an anti-competitive behavior, therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way or in another way.
None of the operators has dominant position, therefore no one has a higher responsibility for its behavior on the market.
The tools necessary for the opening of the mobile market to the operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator," stated in Chaloupa's statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of discouragement.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by the CTU, which telecommunications constitute, from the view of economic competition, one market.
No of the Czech operators has dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts propose another vision of the things: so that the creation of an operator may be possible, it must be every time to be able to make a network operator.
And the mobile operator has a lot logically the monopol on his network.
It thus plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least concerned about UOHS that three mobile operators do in the same way.
However, the complaints of many interested (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar restrictions in negotiations with all operators.
Return responsibility on the CTU is a quite covering tour in the communications through which UOHS is laying hands of the case.
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to pass the news of the Telecommunications Law, which recently adopted, to enhance the powers of the CTU on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
This, the representatives of UOHS must well know, but their interests appear to be different.
When no one looks at, it can go.
This means, the operation of a kind of pseudo operators, many in the Czech mobile networks, remains unexpected.
This is businesses which have their own list of prices of mobile phone services, but these are partly partly.
In most cases, it is a question of firms careing for multi-level marketing.
Mobile telephone services are thus offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many other.
The price lists of these firms are generally available to elections.
The tour of magic consists of the fact that the company made before the operator is a classic business client, which commands a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major client, it receives special price offers (and other)
The problem is that the trade conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such revenge.
"If what you're saying, it could be a transition of the contractual conditions we'd examine and which could result in a delay of employment with the company concerned," answered our question on this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite short that a failure of such activity has not been reached until the responsible for mobile operators.
Notely, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, the operator does not speak against such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these enterprises offer them unnecessary benefits, and, at the same time, by opposition to real operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepisk indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of unnecessary customers.
Moreover, these are required to admit that the SIM card is not recorded under their name, so they can't have it completely, in the way of mobile operators' customers."
But that is exactly what should look strange to the CTU.
Moreover, there is another question to UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a operator?
The UOHS has relatively large powers to be able to develop such activities, and if it does not want to comply with the exposures of operators, which claim that they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
When we're not going to be the lovingest country
As we have already expressed several times, the income of mobile market operators has made a significant decrease in the price of services.
However, nearly in all countries where there were operators, classic operators were trying to avoid their creation, sooner than soon.
The arguments used by these recents were practically the same - too small, even too saturated markets, problems with quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that, in developed countries, the regulatory bodies, who defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Thus, by formal measures as well as by informal pressure, they ended the creation of a first operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory agencies are addressing this issue as a warm land pomegranate that will be removed by sending it to a close goal.
Following experiences that we have, we cannot dismiss the impression that confusion in their skills is more profitable in these cases.
But let's not get the manche after the coin.
If the coulis information is true and an operator will soon appear with us, the Czech mobile market may be moved.
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a mobile operator, the UOHS could only remain inappropriate to the reject (in discrimination) of others concerned.
And maybe we will stop calling more dear than in the rest of Europe.
The new himne Czech has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the Czech national hymne.
On Monday, on the occasion of the Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solely presented the new records of the National Hymne Kde my homev (Where is my country?).
The hymne has been recorded again by the orchestra of the National Theâtre under the direction of Jiří Bölohłavek.
We have four versions - with a song sole man or female, a interpretation with cheer and an instrumental version.
Le chant is secure by Catherine Prince and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the hymne arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Belohłavek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymnes.
As he had already given before the Czech Rozhlas (the Czech Radio), he chose for the interpretation of only songs with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"Despite the beginning, I tried to take care of the two songs, as well as the boy, to understand the words, that they can sing simultaneously," he explained.
The Czech National Hymne will celebrate its 175th anniversary.
The song Kde housev my first retired in 1834 on the Places of Stavovské divadlo (the Theâtre des states) in Fidlovačka (Kermeesse des savetiers), the original cheese room of Joseph Kaietán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
He became popular and people spontaneously added to it.
After the establishment of Checoslovakia in 1918, the first party became naturally part of the national hymne.
It will remain one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How to sound "new"
Common transports (MHD) will introduce, Thursday, puzzle in their billet system
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) will be recorded as the date on which the first passengers and bus will be entered into the metro, the trams and bus, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have a electron.
At this moment, this last is accessible for approximately hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard puzzle card.
The passengers can buy a cookon 30 days or 90 days (he will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time make it record on their puzzle cards in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (The Transport Agency), identified in the meter stations of Muzeum, Mosostek, Nadraža Holešo ։, Andel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajska zahrrada, Kacherov and Luka.
Since yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying cookies via the Internet on the Dopravní podnik websites: www.dpp.cz.
Morning more than four hundred people benefited from the service.
Those who will start using the online magazine can finally forget guichets in the metro stations, where they are up to now in the long hooks for the purpose of paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their cup via the Internet and record it on their opencard card in one of the threescore Müstska knihovna ( municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is a guichet available to passengers with a formed staff, which will help those interested in the purchase of the Internet and, in addition, record the cocktail they bought on their map," said the portfolio of the Martin Opatrny project.
Besides libraries, it will also be possible to record the electrons on Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vessel of several meter stations.
What do these distributors say?
They are red, remind the machines to compose the tickets and passengers may have already been observed in the metro rostyly, Bu日ovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska.
"Aauourd' now, the city has five, but from here the end of the year, it should have four-two," said Opatrny.
A auto will control the cow instead of the driver
The automatics that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
It's enough to enter the Opencard puzzle card and the buyed cook will always record himself on the card.
Electrons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also around the city.
In periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the communities of the Central Bohemia to access capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražska integrovaná dorera (included transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with which they establish the temporary and areaal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the Philip Drápal billets of the Ropid Organization, which designates the times of the common practice transport.
Periodic buses are equipped with card players integrated in the driver's box.
Therefore, during the shipment, it is necessary not only to show the puzzle card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard on the location specified on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing more simpler than to ask the driver's information," Drápal added.
The passengers who do not take the peripheral bus and will not remember the date of the expiration of their cocktail validity may reconnect automatic distributors, initially used to record the cookons on the map.
This is on the aircraft, which will show information about the validity of their document.
Sudes were calling for a reference to the United States
The Swedish Germans asked for the integration of Schumava in the United States in 1945.
This includes a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočesská decká knihovna (La Scientific Library of the South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the United States patronate.
In 1945, some groups of Germans of the Sudes were addressed to the President of the United States with such a desire.
This includes between one letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská decká knihovna.
From Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter, the American President asks not to allow "schumavskska župa" (south of Bohemia forest region) - attached by Hitler in accordance with the Munich Agreement - to be transferred to Checoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and we really want to be sure that the words that declare that the American groups come on the German territory, not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators," it is written in the letter, "Persians, to whom the sort of Shumava holds in heart."
Since the raçament in Tchecoslovakia is not promising - knowing the national nature of the Czech nature - that of brutality, insensitive attitude, incomprehension, oppression and service, the writers ask the American President to take the protector of Shumava in his hands for now and forever.
"We can not believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign State, who oppresss and destroys minorities and has not contributed in anything to the Allies' victory without taking into account the opinion of the fourth million people," it is written in the letter.
The reason for which the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire of vengeance of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had a doubt about the opinion of the Germans of Schumava, it would only have to organize, ­ the letter authors, a referencendum in the region to establish whether its residents wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the United States patronate.
Although the text contained in the letter can, in the light of the current knowledge of the history of the after-government, appear a little naive, some of the overseers, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudes at the time.
While the Czech Germans at least undertaken the question of the exemption of the Republic, they were very few of them.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would go to the Sudes a certain type of autonomy.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czeška Bu日, confirms it.
Pen ́ the war, that was, as German of Češka Bu月o, engaged in the sea in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the prisoners and placed in the Holstein region capture camp, tens of Germans came to consult him to teach them the Czech.
"They believed that once they returned to them, the cheese would benefit them," Chalupa said.
None of the German captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war was deemed that, after the Decrees of Benes, he would be expelled from the Republic.
You don’t think about what you pay!
A emotional campaign will attack the leaders
The action aiming on the most costible road safety in the Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional mediatic campaign as to launch, Thursday, the Ministry of Transport.
The Office of Minister Aleš Rebiček believes that it will disobey the leaders of a dangerous behavior to the flight.
This campaign costs 150 million will appear on TV, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on tradings.
It should discourage the drivers of the quick and alcohol at the flight.
But remember them to take the ceinture before starting.
She wants to touch the consciousness of young leaders, motors, pieces, without forgetting professional leaders.
What will happen in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also shows the "s'ant" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don’t think about what you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is inscribed in maize letters on the map of registration.
Then, in a flash of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
What must symbolize that life can be paid to an instinct instinct.
The spots will "hanter" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired of similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxons countries, where images can be seen commonly with drastic images of accident victims.
He believes that it will lead to a low rate of a·s and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and football strategy against leaders
"What works with the leaders is the sugar and foot.
For them, the sugar is represented, for example, by winning time, when they burn a red fire.
The fuck, it's the threat of an adventure or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to the leaders," said Martin Kořán, the psychologist of the transport of the Hospital Na Homolce.
This is why we need information campaigns in the press and, in particular, negative publicities, we consider psychology.
The panels that indicate the danger to the drivers are already less effective.
"When a statistical panel watching a danger is installed, it will probably be quickly combined with the environment and the leaders will not see it anymore," said Kořán.
Olmert would make peace exchanges almost all occupied territory
Ehud Olmert, the President of the provisional government of Israel, refers to the restitution of nearly all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Cisjor Division, Jerusalem-East and the highests of Golan, in exchange of peace with the Palestinian and the . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He made this statement in a Monday interview by the Yedioth Ahronoth day.
"We must go to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all territories (occupated), even all," Olmert said daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we must take the Palestinians an analogue percentage (of Israel's territory), because without this, peace will not be done," he will.
He admits that possible restitution would understand Jerusalem-East.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors and bulldozers to screw his feet, as it has happened to one of my best friends, will deny the parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted by allocating the two attacks in the city, in July, in which many people were killed and tens of hurtful people.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the holy and historical places" within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain the sovereignty of Israel throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he highlighted afterward.
Return of Golan's heights
Olmert also refers to the retraite of Israel of Golan's highests, which constitutes, to him, an essential condition in order to conclude a peace agreement with it.
However, this would also need some effort from the part.
"I don't propose to conclude peace with the only basis of Golan's retraite," he said.
"The people know very well what they will be going to deny for Golan.
They will have to reject their current relationships with Iran; they will have to reject their relationship with Hezbollah (cooked movement); they will have to refuse the support that they grant Hamas terrorism (moving close), Al-Kaida (Terrorist network), as the first Minister of Djihad (Santa War) in Iraq,” said.
Let's get out after it: The stewards in the car are illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long car is prohibited
In the context of the tragic age of the Autocar company Student Agency near Padoue, Italy, the question is whether stewards and passengers can move within the car.
"If we want to respect the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is opposed to the Road Law," said the portfolio of the Karel Hanzelka Transport Minister.
The question was, during which a 22-year-old host was lost, apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the car.
The young girl was at this time unfortunately sitting near the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats.
However, the car can have an accident, even breast-feeding, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the journals.
What it is important is if the car is under its technical fiction equipped with places standing or not.
If this station equipment is not approved, passengers must stay sitting.
The long distance cars Student Agency has no places to stay; which has been confirmed in Currently.cz by the director of the Radim Jančura company.
"This is a question we have discussed with the Ministry and, at first, he prohibits all movements of passengers.
Then they cancelled it, and we got that passengers could go to the toilet during the travel, as they had their own seat," he denied his position.
The Law ignores the steward
"The role of Steward does not have a unique legal interpretation - no legal prescription is concerned about this.
On the other hand, no legal prescription prohibits the transporter to propose services.
The Road Transport Law only knows the term of vehicle receipt; it does not define its rights and debts," the Hanzelka portfolio is more ambiguous.
Joseph Pokorny, director of the Department of Traveling Vehicles, considers, in contrast, that the law treats sufficiently the problem.
"All depends on the fact if the car in its approval has the permission of offering places standing.
Everything lives in there," he said.
The cars are divided into towns, where there are places standing and a limited maximum speed, interrupted with station places and a higher allowed speed and longer remote roads with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with security ceintures.
As in the plane, a expert says
Jaroslav Horén, BESIP expert (Road Safety) in the transport, does not see the movement of stewards to board as a major problem.
"In a regular employment there is no danger. The situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
Yet, it is not sure when a turbulence will occur and the air's hostility can cover the head."
"Or, if the car would have been broadly released, the laws of the Â would be obviously valid.
Similarly as in a city bus or in a tram.
The transporter must manage the safety of stewards by internal requirements," he also considers that the problem is not regulated in the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only car transporter to offer stewards services.
He's getting two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their staff as a risk operator.
"Everyway, since I'll have the impression that it's a risk rate, I'll remove it.
The passengers can receive their coffee and their journal at the ship.
This would also reduce the costs," he said.
Safety concern is the reason for the absorption of stewards in its vehicles the director of Asiana Alexeï Litvine, which, in comparison with SA, provides a very small number of lines.
"We have no hosts, we've been opposed to it since the beginning.
Soon or later it will end by a death accident," he said, there's a year ago, in Tyden.cz.
A big tragedy has come
A young host in the Plzeň region, who worked for the company for two years, has lost it on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using clignotant and locked the road to the car.
The carrier of this last to try to avoid it by a brushing manwork, but he lodged it on his right side.
Jančura says that the two seats reserved at the rest of the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are locked."
The company accounts to complain against the carrier.
For the damage of the young girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment but also for the financial compensation.
A change of law?
Not Viewed
An amendment of the law, which has been developed for more than one year by a group of 30 experts of the Transport Minister, could provide precisions on the movements of stewards to the car.
"And she did not have any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in the bus, but instead of the system of points, the maximum speed on the west and the use of the phone at the flight," expert Horien said.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as a thing that would put the safety of passengers in danger," concludes Hanzelka portfolio, indicating that the control of car safety is under the police and the Office for the safety of work.
The hopes of Düsseldorfois are on Francfort.
The major words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Director Committee to the home employees.
From a unit of the Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the Deka-Bank of Francfort, "the central institution of the financial markets of the Sparkasse Group" could be constituted by the Court of Justice.
WestLB would offer a "double competence block" of a sustainable productivity in such a case.
However, such a relationship could be the decision to send to other concentrations in the banks sector of the countries.
Consider what it does not happen when a direct committee is trying to demonstrate its ability to action in difficult times.
Because WestLB, wounded, always takes strong pressure.
This is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority of Financial Services, which has recently understood the Government of the North-Westfalen country that the time was counted in the search of a future solution.
However, it has been questioned a few times ago - also from France - of any form between the Deka bank, who knew Sparkasse clients of their investment funds and WestLB.
Of course, the Chief of Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported when presenting the numbers of the final seed to Â that he did not see any sense in the fusion of the house of Lazer Landstrasse with a Land bank, which is Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka Administrative Board, whose half is supported and by the countries' banks and by the grouping of boxes, charged the Director Committee to conduct forwards with WestLB for common trade activities.
It could then act on the debt of the financial market, or parts of this.
However, the speakers are only going to start, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, who, with its 3000 employees, accounts for one of the most important employees on the financial place of France, inter alia, is the question of consolidation of the cups sector.
In 2003, it was believed that Deta-Bank could join the Rhénanie Palatinat Land Bank and Halbab.
Nothing has been shown from this wedding bucket.
Despite the plans, they had been made public that the Government of Hesse has spoken against any participation of Hellaba in these.
Afterward, the two other houses were not yet joined.
The Rhénanie Palatinat country bank was broken at the Bade-Wuttenberg Land bank in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new treaties on the deka-Bank retreatment with the banks of the countries.
Finally, Günther Merl, President of the Director Committee of Hellaba, has yet been pronounced against any commercial combination strategy with its bank.
In spite of this, the feeling is to spread that the collection of different public institutions in the sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Country of Bavery has passed, a BayernLB Union with the Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg could first concrete.
For Helaba, this is not especially a good news.
If the pressure obliged to new fusions had to increase, the possibilities of partners would quickly escape him.
In the South, she would now be a young partner, although she had better resisted the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The grouping of Hesse-Thuringe's boxes and virements, which had 85 per cent of the capital of Helaba, took a lock at the beginning of the year on all Union with WestLB.
It would remain at NorthLB.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one of the faces.
Another aspect is the question of how different trade models of each of these banks can be found.
In June, Merl stated that the decision-making question, which means the commercial model for which the future capacity of the banks of the countries should be assured, had not been resolved until that time by the German grouping of ships and virements.
At the end, a WestLb breakpoint could have occurred, which is obviously not wanted here.
This is also what it is questioned in the letter of the Directorate Committee: in any case, it would be a global resolution for the establishment.
How all of this will be placed in the same pair with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank still.
The second weekend of the festival of the beer is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanied her as a little friend, so nothing is the same, he said.
After them, nearly five litres of beer from the Kaiser mark, there is a good bathy barbo that shows about 200 visitors of the beer festival which the deep sounds of his guest can produce.
Elena's tape on the board of Luca, and then he's cut it up.
From Bologne, they came to Verona.
From there, from the road garage near Porta new gare, four buses take this night to 23:45, `Monaco destination, festa della birra', at 6 h30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for the Italians, in one of the traveling buss of Brazilians.
In a parking corner, the South Americans sing horses and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also brunching, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The bus belongs to Marco, which carries a long bottle of fashion fashion and lamps to the wide silver monsters.
Since five years, they are going to the beer's festival, three of them have already done nothing than this year.
They go there night, stay at the feast, and come back at 22:30.
And the night would include unusual costs, explains Marco.
The travel costs 75 euros, including the pot of welcome with a beer Kaiser, brased in the Bavarus cleanness law, disease insurance and a responsible for the German speaking group - Marco made a language course in Francfort.
And the buss are already running on the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon, everyone gets calm in the bus, the travelers sleep.
It's better, they'll still need their forces.
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates make a break again before Munich, on August 8.
When the small morning, the Marco group finally arrives at six and thirteen hours as scheduled on the parking near the Teresa place, nearly 50 other buses in Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others are racing, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First: it covers the small yellow casquet.
The following is written on the left `Feethe of the Beer', in Gothic, and next to the Internet address of the Marco Travel Agency's `knowcersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: 'When the doors of the head of the beer are opened, we're short', Marco cries in the small morning.
`Courir!' Run and book the places at the bottom of the tent.
'Don't forward, else it is blocked, and not all the yellow caskets on the same, we must divide them into the room!'
The shope, Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the consigne!
`Remember security agents that we are doing well!
When you leave your places, they are gone!'
Third: 'Tonight, to come back here for ten hours and half a pile!' Comprehensive?
And that's there, it's going to the beer festival.
On the road, someone's news of the yellow caskets to the trees to find the road, the panels and even a electoral show of a large bavarian population.
We're trying to be ready to return.
This is the second weekend of the festival of the beer, known as the 'week-end of the Italians'.
There are no precise numbers; 50,000 people who are walking through the Alpes and stretching into the bird kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would come from Italy this weekend.
The Municipal Police is strengthened by seven South Tirol police, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavaroese red cross that makes a statistics on the countries where the Italians take the first place before the British (60 interventions) and the Austrian (approximately 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The particularly appreciated Italians is the tent of the Hofbrau brassery.
Insomnia nights for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German Financial System is relatively stabil, insisted on the Federal Ministry of Finance just a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word 'relatedly' and that it thought that the German ban sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This has actually occurred this weekend.
The financing of the Bavarois Immobilier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), near DAX, receives a billion credit from a German bank consortium to protect market turbulences.
A person in the confidence of the situation said to Re·s Monday that the aid credits are delivered up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interests on the fraction to which it would be right.
The money comes from such private banks as from public law banks.
In the background, it's the Depfa-fill company who supports losses.
The status financial was, a very short-term journal article, refinanced for long-term projects for which he had empowered money - which is not more possible from the fact of uncertainty to markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve was reduced from 95 percent to 2,37 million euros, and the own capital rate was also of 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current benefits and nets from financial transactions were, in comparison to the same period, falling at zero point, the benefits from the allocation of determined credits and mobile values, as well as the resiliation of provisions in credit operations had lost more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only because of the important benefits resulting from the refund of accountability costs from the former Depfa group and the refund of interests and the book of fiscal procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit of profits of approximately 16 per cent has been measured.
After its privatization in 1990, the old state financial was a bad deal of immobile industrial credits, which were then subsidised to the Aareal bank.
Since the classic state financing was not sufficiently rentable, Depfa was then more intensively involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of projects in common between private and State investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the valuation of the company, Hypo Real Estate must take place to amortisations that should have a key material effect on the calculation of wins and losses of the group, even if it is enough.
The fact is that dividends have been amputated.
In 2007, they had been thrown into two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state investor and infrastructure investor since Depfa's race.
It is stronger than other refinancing institutions on the inter-bank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the failure of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the award of credits between banks was again considered tari, the banks who accompanied their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part - approximately 50 billion euros - of the Depfa credits of a short-term refinancing means.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the need for financing of the group is covered with the medium-term credit and the protected undertaking from the impact of international financial markets largely outside the current walking state.
Other sources say that refinancing would be guaranteed by the funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Director Committee explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer take account of the average financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Financial Services Monitoring (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group on the market is now guaranteed.
The bank's actors and creditors are only to expect it.
However, in view of the dynamic and inefficiency of the crisis, there is no certainty.
In addition, it is not impatient that it does not fail to cover the funding in all its extension.
But the contrary can not be deleted.
In the fact that the bank is, according to the latest, still at the doors of insolvency at the end of the evening, this salvation for at least temporary will not be able to reassure the minds.
The course of action has increased from 75 per cent to EUR 3.30.
The courses of obligations, however, are particularly good.
While the debts to the first head are not moved, second-plan currencies flee.
The most touched are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo, and those who have a lifetime over 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed to be an alternative speculation movement, and their value must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international ban system after the net duration of the crisis and the crise of the Institute which has caused the crisis to enter into the establishment of the Depfa bank.
As long as emission institutions, governments and less touched commercial banks are still ready to support the system, there can be a recovery in time.
Or it will happen that no one should hope at this point - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But because of the renewed voices of a partial nationalization, the probability that approached security has become a simple hope today.
This should reserve insomnia nights in particular to long-term creditors on the decision to know whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
The short-term investors can always use this on which they have traveled to provide a report of losses for the next year on the income of the capitals of automatically recovered profits.
Sylvana and bottle secrets in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to be presented for the first day at the High School of Tachibana, girls start riding: Germany is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to Mangas - in her new exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of course in Japan.
What was I excited?
I was scared of the way to go to the Âole.
I'm in Tokyo's office in the direction of Kawasaki and I'm taking the train 40 minutes to the High School of Tachibana.
I have to find the way alone, happily I didn't lose.
The start of the courses is not fixed as strict as we are in Basse-Saxe.
A table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, I was to present me.
I am not of all kinds of love to speak before people, especially before a 40-year-old class.
As I haven't had the uniform of the olive, I put an old jupe of my mother's household, as well as a chemise, chemistry, black amounts and black glasses.
So in this board, I was presented before the pupil, and I tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I call me Sylvana, I came from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I started to keep the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all made low, laughed and signs, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him thanks to my hands.
It belongs to the wordbook that is essential to the survival of the Japanese dogs and means "mignon, chou".
Then I was quickly shot at my place.
The girl near me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was a honour that the corresponding duive was sitting near her.
The rest of the time was quiet enough, but when the gong dreamed, I was stuck in the rules.
Everyone talked to who better, laughed, and asked me many questions - in this case, it's pretty difficult to understand Japanese.
Pene’s pause, then they all went out their Bento.
My household mother also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something else than the German mistressable.
I had rise to aromatic herbs, small sauce, a concomber salad and algas, fruit and a kind of meat around Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
The things have a strange appearance and a go completely new.
What's sure is that everything's really good.
All right, unless you're insulted, brerrrr!
The Bentos are not just dinners in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she prepared herself, and then is especially carefully prepared - in the hope that she can make a little better knowledge of the boy during the pause.
I've read it in my hands.
I'm worried to know if I could keep it here too.
"Why is Japan particularly?" My friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to pass a year in Tokyo.
I always answered:
"Because it makes me, what"
Finally, reading mangas is what I prefer for years.
And to better understand the mangas and culture that at a moment I also started to hold Japanese.
For me, it was really true that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a low for traditions, uses and costumes.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the other hand, Japan is the country of recent trends and trends - on the other hand, it is serious, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have never seen."
The rats also have feelings
A rat or a cafard runs before the danger, does that mean he feels too scared?
Joseph LeDoux's neurophysician is convinced: many animals have also feelings.
But how can we verify that he proves the same thing when he acts in the same way as we?
In the online magazine "E", contributions have been made for several years by scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of the answers to the question "What do you think is true without having the evidence?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of conscience without me or anyone else has not yet been able to prove it as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in that case, at least we can hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As we turn to other species and address the issues of the sense or generally of the conscience, we penetrate in hardly practicable areas because Hardware does not match.
When a rat is before a danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he makes death, fucking or attacking.
Humans have the same way, so some scientists deduce them from a subjective v.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our subjective v. to the difficult animals.
One of the aspects is that circuits nearly always associated with the consciousness huma include the Prefrontal Side Cortex (with its participation in the short-term memory and in the direction and execution functions).
This large region is much more developed in human beings than in the other primates and → be completely absent in other beings.
At least for these aspects of our consciousness that depart from the Pre-frontal Court, among which the conscience of whom we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant particularity could reside in the human language nature: a large part of its existence is linked to the language, which often means that its conscience depends on it.
In that case, we could exclude animals.
But even if the conscience should not depend on the language, this would certainly influence it, so animal conscience, whatever way it has been produced, would probably differ much from most of our conscience states.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness can happen in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, doesn't let it be measured or, in the fact of this special Hardware, analysis based on our own experience, then his observation causes us great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious v, but there is another aspect of the conscience that should be easierly accessible scientifically.
We could examine animal conscience processes without taking into account their content, and this was exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualisation.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, more about the nervous correlations of the conscience than on the causeal mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the Prefrontal Court in the implementation of visualization.
But what's the result of emotions?
I conclude that a emotional system such as the fear is active in a conscious brain of its own activity.
So what we design as "people" is the mental state in which we find when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its sequences, such as the body's reactions) has the live memory.
Thus, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the court that characterize primates, especially the Human.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluble nature, are declined, because we can, with the help of words and grammars, distinguish and category states for them to other than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio ́io, for example, thinks that the feelings of primitive activities are born in the regions of Cortex’s corporate sensation and the cerebral tro’s, such as Jaak Pankseep, which is more on the cerebral troop.
As this network did not have much effect during the hume evolution, it could actually participate in transversal feelings in any way.
From a purely theoretical point, I can't oppose it, but I believe that it is inevitable.
Pankseep argues that what is as fearful in men and rats is likely feeling like in both cases: how can we even check if races and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cafard was in front of the danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my eyes, similar behaviors are not sufficient to prove similar v·s.
Certainly, the helpful nervous comparison: Races and Men have similar cerebral troys, cafards against are not even a brain.
But is the cerebral troop originating in feelings?
And even if we could prove this to man: how could we show it at the rats?
I think rats and other mammifers, maybe even cafards (what knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to show it.
And because their feelings are fully different from ours (when the conscience huma is on special circuits and on the language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than emotional feelings of rats.
In all cases, progress is nervous in the measure where the same thing is weakened in rats and in the Human.
As I don't explore the language and conscience in rats, or feelings, I don't know if they exist.
We could judge this as a short term, but I prefer to go forward rather than keep me in mind against a wall.
I'm actually a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of the EUFA: a time of gratitude for Poland and Ukraine
The Prime Minister of Adjoint Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the EUFA decision at Bordeaux as a evidence of confidence in Ukraine and in its ability to exercise, in relation to Poland, European championships," was announced in Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnistry for our country.
The work just started, and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the challenge of the building or destruction of stages, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after time.
The number of stages for the European championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose time anymore.
We must work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ucrainian Ligue Grigorij Surkis.
"The EUFA has us always."
A more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The direction of the Poland Football Ligue PZPN was suspended by the National Olympical Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The Committee was meeting on the request of the Minister for Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN could not act in the rules," Drzewicki stated by the Poland press agency PAP.
"We have assured the President of the EUFA that the preparations of the 2012 European Championnat would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division Ligue have already been condemned in the Session for the manipulation of obligational delegation; at the end, the beginning of the Ligue has even been devastated in the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indigne anti-attaking
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview - and now she had anxieties with her ex: the Hollywoodian star Meg Ryan raised the ball on her former adulterin Dennis Quaid.
He ecumes - and opposite attacks.
A war of the Late Roses for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, both hollywoodian actors are delivered to a disgraceful battle - at the view and south of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview for the American Journal InStyle on the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been confidential for me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have learned the extension of the troppery only after divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thinking is in Ryan's pressing relationships for his new film "The Women" - there is reported the story of a adulter.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his confidential husband's qualification is tobacco: it would be "Monstrueux", said this in "New York Daily News", 54 years, that "Meg reacts the story of our relationship and manipulation."
It would be more "recurrible" that "the pain and the divorce that lead to a divorce for each child are rebuilding in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid married and soon became the father of jail.
Thus his answer was: "In any case, my life continues.
I feel happy to have a beautiful family that goes to the best."
The prices of aircraft billets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were less sweet than the year.
In Germany, a current study, the flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
The flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of the study of the American Express financial services and travel provider.
The company analyzed its reservations data from the first semester of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first trimester, a clean decrease of benefits in the second trimester.
As the hotel prices have increased for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European towns in average of 6,9 per cent in comparison with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities.
However, from April to June, prices were 3,6 per cent lower than the year.
The trend was particularly clean in Paris and in Rome, where the travelers paid from 30 to 37 per cent less than one year ago.
The causes of all of this would live for American Express in the low course of the dollar that led to a "low-leaving travel of American tourists".
Financial places such as Francfort or London would be even more touched by the recycling of hotel prices like the industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish town, the hotel prices remain with a increase of 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
In the case of flight prices, the tendence was increasing in the first quarter:
In the fact of the cherozen price, the economic class passengers have paid in average 7,1 per cent more than in 2007, long-cour flights, very consumers of fuel, even increased to 29,2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of economic classes have fallen in average of 12,5 per cent in comparison with the trimestre, in case class and in first class, however, the price variations were largely less prono-prono.
In Germany, prices have become more important than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11,9 per cent, in the second quarter, falling from 23,6 per cent.
The German internal flights were even divided by two of these studies.
The reasons for this fall of prices would be a flexible economic growth, explained by the firm.
The request would come from the land in many segments of the aircraft travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an accent pressure on the competition of the "Open Cell" Treaty which will liberalize the aircraft between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the stressed situation is the elimination of non-rentable aircraft companies, as well as the high number of aircraft companies that would have deposited the balance during the first semester 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV Gladbach 1:0
I have a simple goal and methods, SV Hamburg becomes the first of the classing.
In Borussia, Luhukay has not always been able to find one eleven officials.
De Christoffer Klein. Increasing. Catastrophe attack for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player only returned to the game later and his upset throw failed to face the target framework.
His message was exactly formulated, he was out of his lips convincedly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Mr. Hermann Rieger in the clothes of Hambourg's aren's clothes.
It didn't happen a big thing in the clothes, the mid-time was ended, and most of them were rash at their place.
Rieger has been the HSV physiotherapeute for nearly three decades, and he has played a great reputation as many protagonists.
And that's why his request was received in strategic places.
Cornelius Jol has bought and raised the puzzle to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the entrepreneur, head of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Done the orders have been similar: and let it go with this second purpose!
The implementation was missing.
"All wasn't very beautiful to see today," he admitted later Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sustained to be also more detained".
This 1:0 (1:0 at the mid-time), the Hambourg team must take it to a shopping of the head successful by Mladen Pet日 (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach cannot hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"This was a victory salon," resumed Marin Jol.
Hamburg's SV celebrates this Monday in 121 years.
Saturday after the evening, the supporters would collect themselves, the blue heaven above the aren and the provisional classing tables on the geant, which indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without real party.
"We can take the time," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the implicit character of the first Ligue than the domination of its HSV.
The team with her coming back - the Neves and Silva Brazilians, the Objective Guard Petity even as Jansen debugged from the FC Bayern - forms certain doctrines, but it does not yet.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol requested.
By the failure of the vote
At Wall Street, fear.
The first news of the failure of the backup plan has caused the Dow Jones to fall on 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of all history.

The rubber index of Nasdaq was 1548 points with more than seven points.
The most perites of Dow Jones were at that date American Express who lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 per cent.

The actions of the Goldman Sachs Bank accused a decrease of almost ten per cent.
Just a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffet was associated with the company.
In the framework of the safeguard plan, the means must be mobilised for the purchasing of what is called "hypoth" papers.
However, the sum should not be paid once but progressively.
In contrast, the State should recover options on the actions of the financial society which can be correctly interrupted with the development of the course in order to reduce the charge for the Public Tractor.
The courses of action in the tourbillon in Europe and the United States
The billions of assistance for banks in Europe and the United States are not concerned about investors' concerns.
The course of the action of the Great German Bank Hypo Real Estate is spreading and dragging the Dax to the ground.
The United States Dow Jones has grown up despite the salvation of the financial market provided by the State.
The spectacular bass of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank courses led Germany (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The action of the Bavarois Immobiliary Finance has now lost three quarters of its value, despite the operation of the Federal Government and private banks, Commerzbank has accused more than 20 per cent.
The Dax just moved down the importance of 6000 points and covered 5.839 points with a deficit of 3.7 per cent.
Throughout the world, action markets have fallen in genius.
In New York, Wall Street would open with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the 700 billion dollars safeguard plan of the United States Government could not be sufficient to reduce the financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809,25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 per cent.
The room of representatives of the United States was intended to vote on the safeguard plan, and the vote to the Senat should follow on 1 October.

The Private Bank Sal. Openheim subscribed to 23 million new actions.
Moreover, the multinational commercial and tourist stated that action will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
The shadow material influences the flight of space songs
Since years, a mysterious phenomena has left researchers in perplexity: the shadow material affects the speed of space sounds while they are called gravitational support managers.
Experts fear that the general relativeity theory is not completely correct.
Since almost 18 years, the spatial sonde "Ulysses" flys into the space.
In fact, because of carcinogenic drivings quickly yellow, death cryogenes the threat.
Since years, a mysterious phenomena has caused a disarroi among researchers - anomalie of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manwork of space sounds, which provides additional elan in the gravety field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
Thus, sonds can economise many fuel.
The US-European research song Cassini-Huygen used this astuce, just as the Ulysses sun.
This is what surprised researchers since years: flying objects do not always become 100 percent of the way it is attached to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the level of speed.
Sounds become unexpectedly faster or lately.
Until now, the physicians will not explain this effect.
They baptized him the anomalie of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of Albert Einstein's general relativeity, which described the strength of attraction of the material of space covering, could not be completely correct.
The American physician Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton always thinks hard as the iron that Einstein did not miss and try to explain the anomalie of the gravitational support by what the astronomes are called the black material that the astronomes have identified in the universe.
"The black material could be responsible for this failure, which is also close to the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers know the existence of the black material only for about ten years.
It seems to be a force of attraction whose effect is observed on other heavenly bodies.
In contrast, it is completely in· it is that it does not send or reflect any electrical radiation, especially no light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the black material would also represent a good fifth of the whole mass of the universe.
Tourists removed in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their ravisors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed it.
Sudan ravisors had required a ransom of several million euros.
Pene’s fusillade's freedom would have been killed by six ottage prisoners.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were removed.
The negotiations for the ransom would already be engaged.
The Germans are without stop in the kidnapper.
WE ONLINE determines the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in Sahara are free.
This is what the Egyptian state TV, the Arabian Al-Arabian TV chain and the Italian media have been concerted.
The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television chain bulletin Sky TG 24: "Our concitoyens and others have been released.
We are checking their health status," Frattini reported.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions are well and safe, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the excursion in the wilderness should already be on the road to the Cairo.
The circumstances around a fusillad before the release of the ottes remain still smooth: so the kidnappeds would have been nearly to put an end to the removing, and the words of a Egyptian security agent, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without calling a gare.
"The problem was resolved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
It was only to collect the otages, when soon, "This surprise" occurred.
Some Sudan soldiers had baptized this Sunday six of the ravisors in the border area between Soudan, Chad and Egypt, and stopped two of them.
Dutch payers had requested from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be delivered by the German woman from one of the otages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, in the words of a German mediator, freedom of ottes was lost because the kidnappers feared their security.
According to the article, the ravisors wanted to free the female ottes after payment of the ransom.
The men are kept until the ravisors found a safe way to flee.
The German ambassade to Caire has made any comment on this story.
Abuse of a beauty-father, "which leads to self-sufficiency"
A court was informed that years of abus involving by his grandfather led a woman to self-suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57kans, from Stithians, in the Cornuales, was arrested six years after having admitted eight guests of accusation for independent facts.
The Court of Great Instance of Truro mentioned that he regularly linked his beauty, Stéphanie Randle, during his child, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Mr. Randle, age of 34, suicided with her in Mutley, Plymouth, 1 April 2007.
When she lived in Coventry, Trerise had attached her and banded her before forced her to sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornouilles.
His beautiful flight went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Mr. Randle, who was welcomed to the National Trust, was disappointed by abuses that had been infringed to him twice a week.
The general prosecutor, Ramsey Quaife said to the court that friends had told that Mr. Randle, who was a good surfy and cyclist, seemed to have been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "he had lost all hopes for life."
In April 2007, his true father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she suicided with a plastic sack.
Mr. Randle faced the beautiful father of his daughter who had otherwise, edited a letter of confession that ended: "I attached him and the bandai regularly."
"I haven't used her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise, "You are really strange as a feticist, your victim must have been certainly terrified, especially at the age of 7 years.
"This deplaying saga ended by the suicide of the victim.
And what more amazing is that if she hadn't done this gesture, her story would certainly never end at the court."
"I particularly highlight, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed on Stephanie for years.
"Unless these, she would certainly be a happy, promised, and successful young woman today."
Condamnation for the loss of official data.
The Ministerial officer of the Cabinet office, who had forgotten secret documents, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Officer Secrets Act, acknowledged by the BBC.
The man of the Defense Minister was moved when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train in the direction of Waterloo.
The documents passed in the hands of the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any intentional insinuation.
The correspondant of the BBC, Frank Gardner said that this episode had many Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Defence Minister and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The salaries that cannot be appointed shall be accused of violation of section 8.1 of the Act, namely the clause to protect information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministerial officer be placed under the office of the Metropolitan Police, having regard to the very sensitive nature of its work linked to the Secret Services Associated Committee
The documents he lost contained appreciations on Al-Qaeda and the resources of security forces in Iraq.
It was informed of the decision, Monday morning and then transported from him to a secret place.
Building companies against the B&B factory.
The British building companys could have to pay more than 80 million £ to cover Bradford & Bingley.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the depths of 2.5 million Bradford & Bingleys.
The interests of this loan will be paid by all companies who collect the money of the sparers, including 59 building companies.
The Director-General of Building Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles said he was "irritating" to know that the companies and their members would have to pay the cassed pockets...
The loan of £14 billion will be recovered when Bradford & Bingleys' hypotheches will be removed.
But the interests that are going to grow at the same time will be debited every year to 700 financial companies that collect the deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed the BBC that 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is irritant to see that institutions who have had a behavior must now pay some of the factures of institutions that were much less implied.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is claimed that each company must pay a proportional amount to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasure believes that the interests of the loan will be acquired in 2009 at £450 million.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million £ to fix the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Board Company Commercial Committee, stated to the BBC that this decision seemed unjust to him.
It's "irritating" to see that institutions who have had a behavior in the recovery of the immobile market must now pay much less than the institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, date of the first year.
"We must examine all aspects of this matter in the next weeks, to evaluate the options to adopt to avoid the payment and their members of this salary factor," Mr. Cole said.
The interests for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the whole year's interests will be paid, which could be doubled.
Since the building companies are non-actionary organizations, their members are finished by paying the facture either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for accounts.
The milk increases up to five penny in litre
Jersey's people must pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she would increase the large price of her milk, from five penny per litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price which is achieved by a increase of two penny in fev, and followed by a research conducted by a consultation company.
Detailed sellers must decide whether they go to their turn and increase the price to consumers.
. Before the fevmentation, the large price of Jersey milk was for the last time, in 2002.
An ex-Pm of Bangladesh saw the care
A court in Bangladesh rejected a care request to the former Sheikh Hasina PM, which could so be arrested when he returned to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court had to give her his care because of its exam for extortion to a businessman, 50 million Taka (729.000.00 dollars) when it was PM.
This is one of the many of its addresses.
Khaleda Zia, the rival of everlasting Sheikh Hasina, has been relaxed with caution this month.
Sheikh Hasina should come back to Bangladesh for a few weeks, but her party, League Awani, requested that the provisional military government of the country gives him his entire freedom.
Correspondents highlighted that the terms of its release are contradictory because if it is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they don't see why it could not remain free at its return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now call on the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request, saying that she does not need care because she had been authorised to go to the foreign for medical reasons," said her avocate Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present a call against the Order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this care to return to the country to prepare elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should come back after 17 October, said a former leader of the Awami party.
It was arrested last year after the military inheritance government took the power, but was released in June to help the foreigner.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, doesn't give them the subject.
Anxieties for the Afghanistan antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent immunization campaign against the polyopy because of violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations stated.
United Nations last week, a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she says that she has not been able to contact the children of the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, South.
A port of the United Nations word stated that this happened despite the promises of the Taliban to not attack or obstruct thousands during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV Judic Battle
BSkyB lost its proceedings after the sentence of the Competition Committee, which would force him to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmission.
The Court of Concurrence ordered BSkyB to reduce its parts of ITV by 17,9 per cent by less than 7,5 per cent.
The Committee stated that the participation of MSkyB in the past had prevented competition and allowed him to influence ITV injustly.
BSkyB bought its parts in 2006 after an agreement aimed at preventing NTL, now called Virgin Media, buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the BSkyB purchased parts of ITV seed doubt about the effective independence of ITV, which thus encouraged the Commission of Concurrence to investigate
Virgin's patron, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB rejected that the force of reducing its ITV parts would not be reasonable, and in contrast, it was vital – especially because BSkyB was just rejecting its voting rights.
New investigation in the case of American prosecutors.
The United States General Advocate appointed a special officer to check the issue of the licence of nine American prosecutors in 2006.
Everything was born from the case of the General Inspector of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White Maison, Islators and former General Procureur, Alberto Gonzales.
The question is based on the tess of lawyers who support their licence is from political causes.
The Special accusator, Nora Dannehy, will now ask to know if the officers who were asked during the question lie to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Several potentially non-based conduct conduct has not been completely confirmed or resolved," said the General Inspector, Glenn Fine, in his report.
The nomination of a special ability to force witnesses to submit was one of its largest recommendations.
The debate begins by radiation in December 2006 of nine American prosecutors of the United States Justice Department.
At that time, the department stated that the prosecutors were licensed because of median prestations.
However, he concluded that the licensed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other responsibility, which encourages certain observators to grant these licences a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republic of the Congrès, while others would have asked for fraudulent votes against the Democrats.
The American prosecutors seek and follow Judicial institutions for the Government.
It is sure that they can be licensed at any time, but they cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, the Secretary-General Alberto Gonzales, has been accused of being involved in this case of licence, and, finally, he dismissed.
A number of ministerial officers of the Department of Justice also denied them.
The report of the General Inspector was very critical to the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, explaining that he considered "the first responsible" of these licences, and ended by "abdiving" his role as leader," noted that it was not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including the former Bush Officer, Karl Rove, have been critical because they have not succeeded to cooperate during the query.
Meat Loaf's epope must be honored.
The Rock Star Meat Loaf, must be honored at Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out of Hell.
The song, who will receive a oscar during the ceremony in London, next week, said to be "honored" of this.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title of the hit of the Meat Loaf album in 1977.
The night of the price release is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of the Q magazine, said: "There are songs that cross things like time and type, and Bat Out of Hell is certainly part
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires a great voice like the Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that takes almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, classing the fifteenth place.
Moreover, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in classifications, and was sold over 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his true name, has suffered health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to heal his heart-building, has become irregular, after it has been blown on the scene in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite committed it to concerts.
Then we found him a kiss in the voice rings.
A Sombre Street in the town, often forgotten, and Peut Etre Soon in Vente.
New York has hundreds of avenues, bullards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, other only functional.
. Even some veteran taxes and long-term residents do not know to give indications to return to the Extra Place because they have never heard it.
The street is located in the East Village and parked the north of the First Street- to not confusion with the Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Of approximately 30 feet width for 120 long, it has been set to a pulsing ship instead of a active artery.
No panels indicate the street.
It is unable to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirators.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent luxes on the First Street.
He wants to repair Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to stores and boots, which should be opened in the new inmeable.
Other admirators, including long-term neighbors, stated that they were charmed by these recurses simply because one of the last and the oldest streets of the houseboat was left.
But the Department of Preservation and Immobiliar Development of the city that manages the street does not have any interest in keeping it.
This month, at the meeting of the Neighbourhood Committees, Avalon Bay and Avalon Bay representatives have made a proposal that allows the immobile manufacturer to buy the street.
But the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and requested a new proposal to submit the next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No.3.
"The city belongs only a few spaces, and we would like that the city keeps extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to repeat it in state and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and there, some would be used by a coffee where the manufacturer would conceive the space.
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made at the meeting of this month.
Michele de Milly, the door of Avalon Bay's word, said that although the company sees to exploit the street, it does not necessarily mean that she is the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relooker this abandoned hall, and return it," she said, "that was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a door of the Preservation of the Immobilier, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, also highlighting that the mission of the Agency was to develop property instead of managing it.
Compared with his most colored neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a historical printing.
Some believe that Extra Place has taken this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the great closed inheritance of many Philip Minthorne's children has been divorced, leaving this small bottom of the earth, which has been left since.
The back input of CBGB, a closed punk rock monument in 2006, opened to Extra Place; the street is probably more glorious through the photo covering the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was great," said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
She was filled with iron, hailons, barricans, posters, faith and branches."
Some residents, including the bloggers who had already spoken about evolution to the Lux of East Village, opposed the idea of selling extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain quiet.
Others announced Extra Place as a real rareness - a fragment similar to the city that should be made in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Record of Nostalgic Amerment on A City in the Extinction Process) reports the story of the City and Extra Place, which was held in the New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small bul-de-sac, day shadow as night, and delimited by the doors of a rounded iron and persian, full of journals of the last week that run through the gouters."
With little exceptions near, the street has always the same way.
A short rat at the bottom of the road, near a gate that was leading to CBGB, which now became the seat of a chic clothing magazine.
Graphitis on the walls, a bird bottle of 22 vacuums, repairs at the side of journals that just come to be cast.
Some claimants said that they thought only rarely in Extra Place, and suggested its value.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some under estimating the arrival of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they are rolled into shadow, humid and dego".
The Bilingue debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Education Supervisory Programme, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of the study in California, and an elder director of the Department of Education in the Research Institute for Public Policy, is the author of the book "Not as well as you don't think it. Why the average classs must be able to choose their school."
Attraction to the favours of the Spanish voters is a complex business.
The proposals of Barack Obama on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign highlights that "the African and Latin students have less chance to diplomate than the white students." It is a real fact.
In order to combat these differences, Mr Obama's education programme supports, in particular, among many other subjects, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn it.
However, the question for Obama is to know whether his desire to carry out a bilingue education that defends the education in other languages than it was, is also interested in eliminating differences.
Consider, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a elementary school from the east of Los Angeles account.
Students of this school are in great majority of Spanish, and low income.
More than one third of the students, constituted of many new arrival, study the aid.
Among the CM 1, 100% students have passed the 2008 Math State review, expert level.
Similarly, nearly 93% of the students have passed the exam of languages-d'arts
This incredible success has been achieved by another ingredient than the advanced by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street has made an analysis, practice, a constant evaluation of capacity and an exampleal attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reporting Linda Mikels, the main of the Sixth Street, this school set up the instruction of the English "full beauty".
The total immersion in English focused on the almost constant use of the asiatic instruction.
Mrs. Michaels, contrary to the bilingue education, said to me, "We had a great success with a student who came from Mexico, 12 months after, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance to identify it."
"It works, she observes, it's running for us"
Mr. Obama should not take an example of the Sixth Street Prep and replied it in the other schools in most Spanish students who learned it.
The excellent results of this school are talking about themselves; but the education policy within its party (the national educational education supports a long timely balanced education) and its great support for bilingue education, preventing Mr Obama's response.
Although it is favourable to the fact that the immigrants learn it, Mr Obama recently considered this issue as an insignificant, when he declares that we all must stop poliming on the labelled English laws.
"In contrast, he said, "You must ensure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, he should then consider with care the models of education that work, rather than delay them or consider them insignificant.
Net Chute of Petrole Following the New Anxieties of the Economy World
Oil prices have just fallen on Monday, because people fear that the plan of salvation for financial steps will not be able to restore life to the economy.
The operations at the end of the brute oil fell from 7 per cent at $99.80 in the bar. The Mercantile Bourse of New York during the wins of this morning.
The prices have fallen over $20 to the bar since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the markets of primary materials have been cut off by Wall Street's financial aggregation, as well as by two powerful ouragans in the Golf of Mexico.
After I had known in July, an increase in $145.29 at the bar, the prices falled up to $90 in the bar that month, before the deep incertitudes of the financial markets were resumed.
On Monday, investors are again concerned, despite the safeguard agreement, the largest of the history, that week end by the leaders of the Congrès.
The news was decreased by recent concerns which would be a sustainable crisis.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the Wachovia Corporation operations, the government stated this Monday.
At the same time, Belgian, Netherlands and Luxembourgian governments have nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that the franthetic negotiations of this week, concluded with the Saving Agreement, have not been able to make the market revive."
While the economic situation is deteriorated, the request in primary materials, including oil, should be relaxed.
"the prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank's analysts in a letter to their investors."
"We think that the primary materials will not be able to escape this counterparty.
"What the first materials are, our most pressing concern is to understand how the American virus would spread globally and particularly in China."
The bank's analysis reduced their expectations for the next year, since the loss of oil consumption due to economic growth increase was therefore required to reduce 20%, the previsions of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Festival of the Second Time Determining for Improving the Record of the Team.
After having passed in these eight last holidays, more time than everyone in uniform of the Jets Shaun Ellis, the defendant thought had seen everything.
He looked at the second time when the Jets transformed a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I never saw anything like this," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Ar≤na Cardinals were sadly played under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre has succeeded to pass to Laveranues Coles that allows a touchdown of 12 yards, signs a precursor after midnight during which their relationship has made a lot before.
Faver found Coles for two other touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, at 10 seconds of the mid-time.
"I haven't gone out of my area" Favre stated about all its steps in Coles.
"is a medium player"
"We're very good, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played the catch, the defense was the fourth back of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost ticket and made 32 yards until touchdown.
Eric*ith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens left the ball for Warner's sake.
In the last change, the loss of Bowens' ballon could be the most charming event
The Cardinals took the control of this property for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 yards with a benefit from 34 to 0.
It was the best Jets could mark sometimes.
"The Jets Coach, Eric Mangini, to whom we were asked to describe this foolish, said "the second time or the third?"
When the two Jets said to him, they left 21 incapable points in the third time- Mangini said, "I can tell you that I had more appreciated the second time than the third.
." Many points have been marked in short time."
Running beauty, exceeding its world record.
Heil Gibslassia, Ethiopian, has again proved to be worthy of his title of the highest decoration of the centuries, after having acquired his own record of the world at Berlin marathon Sunday, thus became the first to cover 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03:59 of an accommodating course on the floor, Gibslassia held 27 seconds his record at 2:04:26, discussed last year in Berlin.
In 35 years, Gibslassia received the 26st record from his great career world during which he received the campionat of the world or the world record for any distance, from 1600 meters of the marathon.
The last month, Gibslassia had missed the olympical marathon of Beijing, fearing - may be exagered in the eyes of today - that the air pollution does not affect its asthm problems.
In contrast, he promises to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect time-conditions, 48 degrees in the past, 55 in the arge-Gercelassia wins Sunday, now a printing average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The trailers such as Gibslassia and Paul Tergat, both kenians, converted into background corners, contributed to the decrease of the marathon record of more than two minutes in these last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa wins in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday winning, Gibselslassie told reporters, suffered cramps in the molecule two weeks ago, and missed training for a week.
It is evident that the rest allowed him to stay, but not rulled.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All was perfect.
I went back there last week, and today I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best."
It was particularly reproached in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - to have too orchestrated its courses, avoiding the world stars of Marathon, actually counting on the livers as if they were in a track competition, and more considering world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not decrease the size of Gibslassia's capabilities as a fond currency.
Saturday, Gibslassia, which was held by four Kenyans, recorded a time at 1:02:04 on my road.
Two kinian elite cursors, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to defeat Gebslassia after the heads were lost.
At a little more than three miles of the air, Gibslassia made its final remont to get out of Kwambai, which ended at 2:05:36, enhanced his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived at 2:07:48.
In the female course, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizens, ended a wonderful year with the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record at 2:15:25.
The last time, age of 36, Mikitenko, surprised everyone in London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She does not participate in Beijing games because of a bad hypothetic, but promises to win in Berlin, improveing her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It covered a sustainable strategy, allowing the Ethiopic and Kenyans group to take a great benefit , then exceeding about 18 miles a half.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyana, ended at 2:25:01.
In a town in Part, the Orgueil and the trials of the Black Vie
Hidden in the development of his large park, a few miles of the isolated, the chairman and the gentle Orlando, is a small quiet city where the fierceness and complications of the African experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first city full of black to integrate, the childhood house of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is not so simple to do of our days." The city at five lakes, three shorts of croquet, 300 feet skin, 300 good nagers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a town of perlerinage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival each year in Eatonville, to make the most famous in Hurston, the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city that she described - became tourist through its inclusion in the tourist guide of the Florida, published by the Federal Writers' Project - remains a place inside.
She is also independent, dignified, and privacy that she was not already in the 30s, when Hurston told that the black rural population of Florida was often retaining to share its real thoughts with the white man, who "We know so little, don't know what he loses."
Even if this is the year of the election of a black President, Senator Barack Obama, who has called an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain in the view of the foreign.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story" said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, resident forever and the oldest Parisian in the city.
" she must be in accordance with the reality.
Eatonville has been defined as a paradox of triomph and fight.
It represents both a historical model of the use of black and a community of nearly 2400 people where the poverty rate is two times the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of black rural culture - sometimes deadlined, sometimes claimed - which reminds the birth of the American slave.
What would explain why residents are both fierce and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her home city throughout the world through sincere books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the leadership of Florida transformed this city, just at Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which runs into the chapter of the black story and human drama.
As a big cake in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property magazine of the first Major of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who then was divorced in several private parties.
"over the road on the left," she wrote, "You'll find the modern marron and white school, with its gardens and these well-conserved game areas whom Howard Miller has always cared, even though he knows not to read and write.
She also mentioned the new Widow Dash husband and wrote that Lee Glenn's sales of drinks of any kind and everything that can serve passenger people.
So almost a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with an auto government, but also with analfabetization, refrigeration, and sex.
Obviously, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora well described the reality "declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young girls who Horston immortalized, quoting songs without color, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She's: "certain people have not appreciated."
We always remember Hurston as a living and antric person, who often came back after his family denied to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, reminded that Hurston came from a town without warning, at the border of a big Chevrolet, a cigarette to the mouth and carrying bags here, where even today, we are proud of traditional habits.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told it, while many were moving about her.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also balanced in his chair of the past patio that gives on the Lake Sabelia, where Hurston certainly was baptized, that she never remained too long.
At Hurston's death in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she had been a star of the literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman of Barnard College of the 20th century, she was buried in a grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she saw.
In Eatonville, there is no large memory, nor place for the great public.
I don't think they had understanded the contribution or heritage she offered to the world " said Valeri Boyd, author of "Wrappedi in Rainbows", a Hurston's biography in 2003.
A crucial time occurred in the 1980s.
Officials of Orrange County wanted to pass an authorout to five roads in town, to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main road at two roads of the community.
The development of Orlando has already moved Interstate 4 to the west angle of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville just returned from a difficult period of his history.
A forced integration, among so many other things, ended the isolation of the community relatively idylic.
In the 1950s, the dispute on the mixture of races led hatred to the doors of the community.
"In this time, a band of white youths came to launch anaries or objects against the people sitting on the side," Mr. Franklin said.
"A lady is even dead."
"They made it a pasture of their car."
In a letter of 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston doubts the request of the Supreme Court concerning a forced integration, which defines its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insultant instead of glorifying my race."
The residents now claim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, has dismissed Eatonville cohesion and has afflicted the confidence of young people.
"The black kids had the habit of being embraced - I remember that we were embracing our master on the morning, and evening," said N.Y. Nath, Ella Dinkins daughter, as well as the leader of the Eatonville Community's Sauvegard, a non-profit group.
This has been a long time until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You don't blame your white teacher because it's white-- I mean, there's a cultural demarcation line here ", said Mrs. Nath.
Civil rights, otherwise, have allowed to create space for many other black Zora Neale Hurston- writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the damage, such as she, army of a happy self-trust and lines of conduct such as: "How can they deny my company's pleasure?"
That's over me."
In 1975, Alice Walker went on the anonymous grave of Hurston and started fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a surveying life on Hurston performed by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, restored it to the American canons.
The project of the Occidence just arrived at the moment when the most famous girl of Eatonville had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston viewed her as a salvator.
The community began to organize an Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would generate this authorout.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years after, and many return in January to remember it.
After many years, the account rejected the proposal of the West.
"The five-way five-speaking five roads, extremely quickly, a true civic proudness," said Melle.
Mrs. Boyd summed all the statement that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the project of the surface allowed him to change his own image.
No residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer of our church since 1993, as they came in a large number, and the residents began to consider the past.
Eatonville has been classified historical city since 1998.
A monothema library (obviously renamed Hurston) will work in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repeated.
Today, Eatonville remains an error for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, she can be considered as a back street at the last time of a river rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
( 90 per cent of black today)
Foreigners who come to discover the story of Eatonville, his reason to be, are still treated with density.
You need to ask permission for most of the interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mile Jones, a courageous teacher who has a low for the living red, are always afraid that their island community is not well understandable.
However, because of the expansion of the festival Hurston, a certain local orgy level is emerging.
Young people, particularly, are tending to consider Eatonville as Hurston as his whole race: beautiful, problems and everything, not better or worse, but also fierce, creative, bossing, foolish and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is good for the sincere civil affection that we can hear in the vote of Mr. Franklin's neighbor, Edwin Harvey's 18-year, which intends to return to Eatonville after the office to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11ans, winter Park jumeals, have learned correctly the description of Eatonville.
"The majority of people, who passe in this area, will think, "Oh, this city did not compare anything to others," Alondra Kenon said after the last Sunday mess.
But if you stop and take the time to contempt the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone talks couragely financially.
Nevertheless, nothing changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan had been remote from kiosk and gentle television screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eyes of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and nids of abeil above their tissue, the bans and cover fund managers that monopolise New York pass the worst "work day to the office" since the crack of 1929.
The suppliers continue to stumble on the trottoirs, with their cars and their muffin plates for the morning meetings.
Latins are still traveling between the immortal residents, such as mules, a fifty-year-feed chemicals that are stumbled with a jog on its stairs.
Office employees continue to do the cup to buy their morning sandwich to walking goods, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16 and 19 hours a week.
I hadn't felt the crisis despite the completely pessimist stories until this after midnight when I decided to open a new shopping account.
Happy that I was planned to work after midnight, because I found my local office at JP Morgan Chase, a twenty-year-old people who were doing this.
Not before the boxers' guitets, nor to get away from the species or make a payment, but before the customer service guichet, where customers commanded their cheques, the tourists asked the direction for the Macy magazine, and the new customers would open accounts.
Most of those before me, I would learn later from Starr, my "autorised personal bank", were all doing the question for the same reason as I.
Not the same way, because they have already removed their economy from smaller banks, such as the new Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the State Island.
They retrieved their money from the bank accounts called thriffs (including a bathing company), credit charges, and the type of local sale boxes and their branches that work only in a state, and who say to treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
The last days, Washington Mutual, a 327$ capital bank has made a bank, and when the New Yorkians would return home for weekend end this evening, another bank, Wachovia, to the accounts of a value of $440 million, they were unexpectedly looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the employees of magazines who are before me, feared of another potential disaster, have transferred their money to a bank that is reliable or the one who makes the most salvation in Wall Street.
New Yorkians have become very family members in the world of the finance in recent weeks.
"I had a lady to my Chinese supermarket, talking to Lehman Brothers' phone, the bank that made a failure, and her maid Director-General Dick Fuld, with the same knowledge she could have to criticize.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my immobile, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries of my goods of fruit and fruit.
She told me after my visit to the bank. "I put all my economy on the market of money funds.
"I have changed, I don't want to take a risk."
Muslim tombs profaned while Austria switchs up to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right side of the Austrian Freedom Party party and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian Right Vlaams Belang, takes part in a manifestation to present the "towns against Islamization" in Antwerp, June 17 January 2008.
They have road panels that illustrate rayed mosquets in red.
The police accuses the extremists of the right extrémity of having profaned an Austrian Muslim cimetre, the weekend of the victory of extreme political parties Droite to the general elections of the country.
More than 90 tombs were seriously damaged in the Traun cimetary, near Linz, between Friday and this morning; the police acted by a organized action.
The criminals picked on several tombs, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; the detectives, however, believe that it could be done to deceive the feeling of hatred of extremists to the Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be in some way related to elections.
A door of the Islamic Local Community stated that it was "profundly shocked" in the announcement of this profanation, which just occurs during the religious month of Ramadan, which touchs its end.
Austria thinks seriously to find his courage, after its occilation towards the right in Parliamentary elections of yesterday.
The two extreme extreme parts that reflected almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered critics, such as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 per cent of votes, led his campaign against the gate of the foulard and Burkas, and even expressed his opposite to food alaha.
His final course in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood" to avoid the mount of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosque and mineres, declareing that they would be a political symbol of the islamization of Austria and Europe.
The reviews and analysis made just after elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political block of the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference, because concerns of their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter prohibited travel to the foreign.
The courts prohibited the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse on child, expatriation in France and Spain.
The judges imposed to Glitter a six-month interruption, after expressing the authorities under control, his intention to become in Spain.
The police to Kent had granted this prohibition to travel last Thursday after providing the magistrates the responsibility of Glitter for sexual abuse on child.
Glitter, or his true name, Paul Gadd, was not present in the audience of Ashford's limited courts, but was also represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A port of the court said " Thursday 25 September at the court of Ashford, Kent's police asked an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until 25 March.

A source of the Ministry of Interior stated that Jcumaith, the Ministry of Interior, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been prohibited of movements in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to catch elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photograph
We're not taking the balls, nor ethern clothes.
The essence of the great masters of the flamenco, released from all pressures for → the aspect of man or woman.
On the one side the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the inconvenience, in these moments of the great public, where intimate gestures and stealing views of artists who are not concerned about to go up on scene.
German Günther Bauer mixed in "Flamenco - people" theatrality of some scene placed with songs, dancers and guísts with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photograph represents the special icon of flamenco under different angles.
Included in the programming of the Moon of the Flamande Photography, the exhibition "respects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the Creator, which clarifys that "Flamenco - people" " may be anything but, after seeing photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on scene.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists able to transmit on the scene of passion, tristation, joy... by the public.
To capture personality instincts of these artists, you don't have to make photos on scene.
They have a personality and a personal character.
What I was interested was to create an intime atmosphere that allows me to catch with the camera of the instinct instincts of the flamenco stars. "
Avec the festival "Popular Chant of Mines", Bauer started in 1997 a long journey to photograph the songs, guísts or dancers with a flat camera.
These are portraits that, through the choice of the camera and the material, memorize the classic photograph.
The implementation of various methods of rubber with the classic side of the image, by giving him a touch of modernity, reflects the perception of the flamenco≤ Bauer: "A music with very traditional racines that develop and surprise each day."
It is not the dance or song in himself, but the personality and the character of the artist who holds the public with his art.
The research of the essential and magic was the continuity of this work that we have presented in the El Fotomata gallery in these days.
The flamenco wheels such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about 60 photographed artists.
The project was transformed into anthology of the flamenco, which will soon be made into a collection book of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits brought him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Sportart Project" "Sportart".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photograph admits that he loves the photographer would bring people, know them and can enter into their lives for a more or less instinct.
I think it's the most difficult type in the photography.
You're faced with people, persons that sometimes you don't know or who just leave you a few minutes to be able to make them a photo.
Despite these circumstances, as photograph, I always try that my ideas become reality. "
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco "Flamenco - people" is exposed to the Galerie El Fotomata, which is located at the 20th Street of Mata (parallel to the Peopleria de Hercule) which will be opened until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roman he wrote is "very audace"
The Roman is developed in places that no one knows and treats inconque, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to make the new project on which he works, a Roman who has the main personality of Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who has v·20 years in the Congo and who has passed by the Amazonian.
The favor to the Nobel price of Literature confessed yesterday at Hay Festival Segovia, that the Roman who takes it now "is a real audace" and that "all shows that he should not write it."
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'll do it and hope to end it," he concluded in his intervention at the Ide exchange festival and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the dogs" was the most expected person in the third edition of this festival and fulfilled its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who received the price of the Hay Festival to the majority of the votes of the participants, made a full room at the theater Juan Bravo.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, was found in front of a fascinated public who did not see the past time during which Peruvia, with a wonderful memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which was due to "sa seif of reading" and "life new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodic manner" through an intense documentation work, correcting and rewriteing a part of the text to face his "many of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his Romans.
The Spanish-American romance admitted that " there is no means" to measure and know if the books change life. "But I believe that literature is a pure funny, an ephemer experience," he highlighted Vargas Llosa, who said that this is "a effects" and "reduce people less like," because the writers were asked to "do not let them go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
The bad time goes down the Pooblanco fry
The feast of the banderillas that concluded the rates of Pooblanco fee was suspended yesterday after the horse towers had checked that the arenal was unfair.
In this way, the organizational committee, in accordance with Fermin Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the collection of the toilet course.
The bad of the time was deceived on this feast, because two feasts on three were finally not able to happen.
Samedi is the rain that prevented the collection of the second course of towers.

Thus only the Friday Festival has occurred

The afternoon even Alejandro Talavante concluded on two bands planted on the back of the tower and a covered ear that the covered grades had applauded more than his fight in himself with the tape.
More worse for El Julie, who entered the arrenes of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
When his battle with the second battle, after a purely better fight, he had been sealed by most of the public.

Five hours at least ten of the morning.
Euskadi Police Control (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Armenion Community (Alava).
Police agents are arresting two employees of a fourgonet, and these two finally run away.

Actor Heather Locklear arrested for conducting under the effect of a medicinal product
Actor Heather Locklear, Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for conducting under the effect of a medicine.
A witness saw her to make strange handworks trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to that a portfolio of the police patrol of California was sent to the newspaper People.
The testimony explained that at 16:30, Locklear "speaked on the accelerator, making a lot of voice, trying to get out of the garage car, and walking back several times, she rolled on its sunlights."
Shortly afterward, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actor, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the west and went out of his vehicle.
This person, at this time, called the emergency services because she was concerned about Locklear's life.
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actor sitting inside her vehicle, which partly blocked the road.
"He looked disoriented," that's why agents led it to the specialized centre in drugs and alcohol to perform a test.
According to a police portfolio, the actor proved co-operative and the alcohol abuse has been separated from the beginning, although "without the observation of police officers in the first view, we pensioned that Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested by being suspicious of having led under the effect of a substance that was not spunged and was incarcered at 19:00 and left a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear went out of the Ar′na clinic where it was internally in order to take care of a nervous depression.
Lamazares requested the Union's Left Federation to assume its responsibility in Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of the Union Gaspar Llamazares today stated that it is the regional federality to take a decision on the case of the former adviser of the Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who has released the last week after having been accused to carry out favor treatments to its family members.
"In this case, I am very federalist, and it will be the andalous organization who will have to carry out his responsibility," Lamazares said in relation to the behavior of the political party that he will be adopted within the municipal Council of Seville.
However, the Leader of the Union's Leader requested that investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have done: "The Left Union has always defended this type of business to have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also highlighted that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officers".
"Sangre de Mayo", also Garci
By inspiring the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci regenerates the famous battle of Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film of his film with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The cineast tried to "scan the many persons and to illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the romantic famous, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevari would be at the head of the long list of actors.
The movie of more than two hours and a half, "Sangre de Mayo" will make its out in the next Friday film rooms, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid more than four hours.
Great amazing of Galdós literature, José Luis Garci assured that he had accomplished with this tournament "a dream of child" through Esperanza Aguirre, which loaded it, three years ago, to turn a memorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, which he always accepted when the story was held to national history facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid Community constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce the environment of" a Spanish who was a leader for the fight, since the fight for independence led the people to rebellion under the Government of Ferdinand VII," he reported.
But the cineast is sorry that he has not received a finance as for the movies "Captain Alatriste" or "The Fantoms of Goya" - more than the double of that obtained for "Sangre de Mayo" - because he could not turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcarcel, with which he had been with during almost all his career.
The cineast of "Volver started" affected its usual way of working, on the station of actors, with which he has the habit to repeat before the start of the tournament and to whom he does not casting, since it is "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the cineast is to go to the theater and to the cinema to keep his information".
Many participants in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat before the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times the Oscar candidate (he wined one), Garci considers that the three candidates films representing Spain this year in the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de Mayo", "Seven billion billion" and finally the winner," The young tourneal, "no representatives of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
Avec this film Garci doesn't affect a price.
"In the beginning you believe you work for the seed, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and now you are pleased to make a more movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional care.
Isabelle Bayón is located in the skin of the Sevillane Dance Tortola Valencia
A sevillane dance will also make a sevillane dance.
Carmen Thortola Valencia, a daughter of a catalan father (Florenz Tortola Ferrer) and a andalouse mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), is born in Triana's quarter and will live in London with his family at the age of three years.
It was a free and specialist dance of the east dance.
She is a tremendous life of the freedom of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was buddhist and vegetary and pleaded for abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of Dance in Europe of the Intergovernmental Wars was fascinated with Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa日a, and this last proposed me to interpret the sevillane Dance Thortola Valencia, and it was incredible for me."
According to the dance, "We're not trying to tell his life but to translate his way of thinking.
The titles of her dance made me think of flamenco.
So the "papillon dance" made me think of a cuban popular dance and "the serpent dance" to some tangos.
His dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same to her, " she said.
The scene was made by two notable contributions: the Miguel Poveda who sang again Isabela in one of its spectacles, as he had done to "The door opened" and the professor Matilde Coral, who exclusively wanted to be with the one who was his own.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature person.
I'm happy because she accepted to play a role in my work and it honors me. "
The scene was also made through the musical composite and guitars of Jesus Torres y月o Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, and the violation of Rafa El Viola and the actor's, Juanfra Juárez, who plays the role of the everlasting companion of this kind of artists who were considered as divas.
This work is also in a certain way that the life of this woman has been shown in so far places, especially for the time, such as in India, the United States, or in Russia, but also throughout Europe, as it usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think that these women have a great influence in their time and now no one knows and does not value her work," says Bayon.
The spectacle will begin at 20:30 in the theater Lope de Vega
The publication of the "Recently Married Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first issue of the "Recently Married Poet's Journal" in the Church Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, was included in the framework of the activities provided by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to collect the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to memorize the fifth anniversary of the Conceition of the Nobel Price and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to its end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has occurred in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the roading exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This lamp of light" which was invoked in the last month of May and who, after traveling into the various andalous provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Recently Married Poet's Journal", published by Pedro Tabernaro and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most andalous poetes with.
America pleases less without Paul Newman
" Sometimes God created perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is of the actrice Sally Field, who worked with him in "Afsence of evil", and illustrates well the desperateness of the American cinema, and of all America, faced with the wounding idea that Newman is no more than this world.
He was deceived to a Oscar
He did not turn since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard time for everyone.
"It's sometimes what a feeling exceeds any expression, and now I lost a big friend," Robert Redford wept, "my life and my country were better by his existence."
No one was afraid to become ridicule or exagerate.
One of the fathers of the cinema and the country died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and markets feared, the appreciation of the Americans was very low, seeking disappointment of dignity reasons.
When time is so hard and without reason to live, it remains humans only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarnated for everyone a perfect idea of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defendant of lost and winned causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drogue fight created in the honor of his older man died after a overdose and the creation of his own bio food mark.
It was a victory for a country who was deceived to impose a self-suicide food culture.
This expansive wake of admiration was Hollywood without taking attention to nationalities or passengers.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Wireless, found that no James Bond was dead before him.
Another one, the Oskaris Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the sum of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Crowe, was named Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He placed us the high bar," said George Clooney, who may be the only one today who is trying to persuade it as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious and remote private life from the goals.
This is not always easy or possible in the media jungle of our day.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years in Joanne Woodward, who was faithful even if the opportunities were not missing to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside me, if I have a biftck in my fridge?", Did he have the habit of playing.
In heaven, he is proud to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"In all the great roles he interpreted, he was never so proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the grandfather's attention and philanthrope," he said.
Madrid in the course to organize Olympics Games 2016
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympical Games, after the failure in 2012, that could be done in 2016.
But I'm asking if we're ready.
If we take the example of the course of yesterday: we're not!
They call him the perfect course, but it was the worst course I have never participated.
If they had taken into account all the errors occurred during the course, they would be subject to an eliminational note.
But let's examine everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the retraction of dosars, which forces you to go forward.
It's not bad but if they make you move it would be better than they give you everything (including the electronic puzzle for courses).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the dosar (the first error, moving only for this) and (after a long waiting row) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the maillot (the second error, because I need a XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is that because of the crisis they decided to buy that small-screen maillots with less tissue and less dearly?
Well, this is nothing about what happened on the course day.
In addition to the fact that you have to go there very soon to get the electronic puzzle, the waiting row is 15 minutes and, in addition, you need to leave his bag at the entrance.
The expectation was more than 35 minutes, and it is incomprehensible because 11,000 people are expected for these courses.
Since there was a long waiting row, competitions started and we haven't yet left our sack on the entrance, although once it was done, it would be worse.
Moreover, the rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which rebellion and appeal of the bar.
I think about 500 people will have the pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because they have given me who, I think, did not mark the outcome correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to cite a perfect example of course, this would not come to me in particular.
So I think we can always dream of become the town of the hotel for the J.O. of 2016.
Microsoft looks for a receptionist (virtual)
In the combination of MIT Microsoft Emergentes Technologies, a new image and interaction system has been presented, a species of artificial intellectual intelligence, but able to complete some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a boat to move to the company campus) in response to what it was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the place, which are - including remembering what posts they occupy - and listening and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also re-group them from the chat groups
In the presentation video, the recipient detects a third person, but it understands that it does not belong to the group who is talking to her and that it is not part of the company.
She asks her if she's here to visit someone and she says she's gonna answer her in a few instants.
All this without blue.
Impressionant.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things about which to take place, for example, on the next version of its operational system, Windows.
This week we have discussed more than a change in strategies at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be more and it will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the insufficient instead of unusual applications, they would be five times faster.
This represents a discovery because Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped with functions and "external" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft has reason, his operational system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory -- which Google Chrome is the first approach from Google to make competition to Windows.
Many people have just highlighted that a Internet browser is not a operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis for the information material and software to understand.
He does the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your beautiful mother.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but it must be seen the "death" of the operational system, not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People make less attention to the operational system but more to the Internet browser.
The computer is allocated only to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and people pass more time to navigate on the Internet than to park windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can at least.
And Windows 7 must contain less applications, much less than View.
Less worse, hot moon, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching his own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They need this desperately, in fact, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved to Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the Drink Distributor, a show of their request to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for Internet information.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not go out at the beginning of 2009 but to the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to start Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, doesn't matter more than one employer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dear.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso was at the Côte d'Azur, Â° di Caprio, and he was a part of the holding of the ́s muscle gays in the 'The Parrain' of Francis Ford Coppola.
And if we put us to number all of its apparatus, we could also cite this moustachu cup that was up to weight in a walking circle.
It's not just a simple man's body maillot in coton, moving and without bottles.
It is called "tank", but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels is different from all other.
On the other hand, by his flamboying name - even though he is known under the name of 'Marcel' - who has to see the sport because he takes the name, and the name, the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a loversman of the song Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel ' distinguishes from others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (will be able) that the most body maillots have in the cow.
But attention, because the Belgian mark produces not only top tanks.
But it also produces sweat-shirt, retro boxers, cashmire cardidants, cotton bags, babys, mini-shorts...
Constructed clothes for comfort of sub-cloths.
Even if it's damage to carry them only as sub-klets.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry about me."
His great similarity with her sister did not prevent her own personality.
Monica'z is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the sisters are seriously taking their new activities in the mode.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who make their name.
She was present in the promotion that Mango mark made in Paris to her new social seat but also to present the most important prices of the way than the Spanish house sponsorized.
Monica is calm and scared.
Ray us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have grown for Mango for the new automne winter season, but also to assist the presentation of the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of Opera in Valentino's honor.
One very intense day, but at the same time, excitingly waiting for us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth session?
The film of the 50s and 60s is encouraging us, and we inspire it much for our collections.
I love myself very much to wallow in town and watch women to see how they are embraced, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dance, actor and designer, you're a very polyvalent woman: isn't it?
I think yes, but at the end of all, they are joined, and these activities have many things in common.
Since I was all small, I loved the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother to look at the arms of my grandmother and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than to go to the attracting park.
And then, when I became dancing, I always tried to care about my way of shackling.
The dancers love to be able to stumble for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel well.
And in the actor's role, when you put your clothes in this moment, you're actually putting yourself in the skin of the personality.
All right, it's connected.
You haven't been 30 years ago: was that hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and has life with less problems.
The biological hour doesn't make me afraid.
I did all that I wanted to do since all the little, and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're gonna become a mother?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and, in addition, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose this.
I don't worry about the candidate.
What I'm going to do is to give my son a lot of happiness and to educate him with much love.
Let's go to the film, you're waiting for the different movies you've turned out last year.
It's true, I'm quick to get out.
I'm a woman issued from the theater, I'm very impatient and anxious, I'd like to have everything now but, of course, it's not possible.
I'm quick to succeed the movies 'The last hour' and 'Search for Christ'.
To see what you're going to think about...
A few days ago you started on the past with Naomi Campbell, right?
Don't say that!
I didn't get up on the past to make the mannequin.
Just, Naomi Campbell called me, I know it from a short time, to invite me to participate in London in a favorable rubber for his → for support for women and clothing we showed - I showed two clothes of our crossed collection for Mango - were sold to the businessers to collect money for the Naomi NGO.
The people whom Naomi is a person in the heart of the tender.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Moreover, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to break for a so noble cause, but if she had asked me to do it, I would have done it anyway.
The importance is to make life better to women of the third world.
Alcohol recycles to the flight must be the system 'alcolock'
The Ministry of the Interior wants the driver who had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholism to have in his vehicle a system that prevents the starting of the vehicle in the state of beverage, or if it does not fail.
The initiative has already been announced in the last month of June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will take a year.
His goal is the reintegration of the driver by proposing it road re-education courses.
The Ministry of State of Road Safety, but also the General Direction of Router Security and the Technological Institute Fund for Car Safety, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the cars arrested for more than one time in the pressure state, the car represents.
Alcolock would avoid this because it is a system on the vehicle which measures the rate of alcohol in the haleine and prevents the start of the vehicle if the driver does not suffer before; or when the rate of alcohol of the driver is higher than the authorised.
Its cost is over 1000 euros and is charged by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device were reduced to 65 % of crimes during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is considered that this could save life to 115 people every year.
This measure is only in administrative sanctions for two reasons: to face these behaviors before they become criminal crimes.
And easily implement it, since the legal reform can be made by ways, but the reform by criminal ways requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have a experimental manner.
Tomorrow, the Congrès of Members will vote for a initiative of the Spanish socialist party that proposes to install this system in school buss as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17.40 a.m., the official time for the Spanish Air Force aircraft, where the Princes of Asturies were traveling to the Hangar Chairman of the Airport Benito Juárez of Mexico DF.
The sun was at the watch to sleep, but its rayons still were obligated to put the hand in a wheel to see the king's couple down from the plane.
At the stage, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours ago, I had asked on the street, to the taxi driver, if it was worth that the Spanish Princes visited the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, well, then we can't go to the airport to take customers at that time... are you from here or then...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish but I've been thinking here for two years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexico press knows very well who are the Princess of the Assyrians and knows the importance of traveling.
They are many to wait in the airport hangar near the red bag and a military range of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and smiling of marine blue, the Princess, when he has his hair at the wind, is very stuck and doesn't carry its 'peep-toes' habitual; maybe they had told him that a orage threatened.
They make a quick stop at the photographs before they go to the room where the official court is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a rigolo journalist of the Mexico TV waiting for them.
The most prestigious price of mode
There is certainly no more appropriate place in the world to present a mode price than Paris and there is certainly no extraordinary and good living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of the new talents of the mode.
The winner will be reserved by a price of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango's vitrine at 54 bulevard Haussmann in Paris, and she was almost emotional.
Certainly, this is the second largest magazine of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 metres in squared surface.
The first book is located in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank Valentino, President of the jury of the concurrence, have made us find in a lushing dinner at the Garnier of Paris.
As a nearby table of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, appeared even more spectacular.
By giving up the heart and doing against a bad heartful strength, because of the latest death of his brother, Nati put a man of Mango and some ELAH parks, who cut the sword, and arms on it, arms down with his son Luis - a good man of almost two meters up – she joined Valentino to her prepared dinner in her honor.
Andik, Mango's owner, a galant man, as well as the Rohovil Baron ended the evening without clothes because they had prepared them to two ladies.
Monicaćaz, who presented in the magazine with a butter and a chemise – from her own collection - and who for dinner was metamorphosed by taking a long sexy and black clothes, was embarrassed when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballets' repetitions room and remembering the good old time, she took one of the bars and made the gesture of a big pit '.
Inés Sastre was not left for the visit of the palace dependences, but she showed us before on her phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure to see Olivier Martínez – another nice man who moves in moto - and John Tra®, who came to Paris's intercontinental hotel, with his draps, his sticks, and asked for the prealable, that there are no worries in his room.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and the freshness of daily life.
And to coordinate everything, they are all recorded in a book that will bring relax to bookers on 30 September.
The wake-up attracts us almost when it sounds every morning at 7 hours, but it's worse when we think about the aggressive rythme that imposes us the current life.
The office is synonymous of pressure and the pain computer at the bottom.
Stress represents the harm of the 20th century.
But there are no two methods to combat daily weakness and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, no more or less than one.
Besides yoga positions, classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in a book page a 'menu' of methods adapted to go and at the time of each.
The anti-stress work is entitled '1001 ways to detain ' and will come directly to the books of editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that it is not possible for peace in places such as work or through personal relations, this 'manual' deductes such faith.
Moreover, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural receipts that help you to detain.
If adrenaline doesn't short in your vineyards to restore the balance of your body and if the stress has become a problem, it's time to sit in the canapy, disconnect from his mind and get reading.
_Speak Leather
Some kids talk about the night.
I am not referring to those who are very wake up by telling us something that happened on the previous day, but to children who talk during their sleep.
The first time that happens this can surprise you, but actually it doesn't matter.
It's a blessed alteration of sleep that is called dream.
It's very common, especially in children and adolescents.
It's sure there's more than one who's talking about the night.
This phenomena can appear very spontaneously (one time in life, for example, associated with a strong fever episode), or more pêdic (all days, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember any more.
There is no unique reason to determine its appearance
They are often linked to other changes of sleep, such as cauchemars, nightwreaks, nocturn ennuries (for pipi to bed) or somnambulism, but it is not always the case.
As we already said before, they can also be associated with very strong fever, stress or surexcitation situations.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomena.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a little quiet voice, with isolated words, murmurs or otherwise with cries, weeping, long speech...
If the dream becomes very often, it would be Jewish to observe the child and to consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to explain this problem.
We said that it is a blessed change, so there is no treatment, except if it is linked to another change of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is linked to an apnea of sleep or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not exciting the child before he goes to sleep.
So seeking quiet games and avoiding programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous kids who are deceived to be detained, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are inoffensive for the child and that the next day he will not remember more than what happened.
Useful Councils
Don't wake him up.
It's unusual because he's inconscient and you'll wake it up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and then rests.
Remember that if it is very anxious several times, it is recommended to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (what is not usual), do not try to ask him for information.
You'll get nothing, because he's sleeping, he's not aware that he can organize his thinking.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what it is dreaming, and then take care of how you will interpret the information and conclusions that you will take.
Never tell the child that you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even by the plaisant.
This causes much anxiety.
Finally, don't worry, that's nothing bad, it's a episode that only takes a few minutes.
Icelanders... End
Illhaeusern finally found the way of the victory on his territory after a long time of design.
Without making a big match, the Youths and Blacks have created the largest number of opportunities and have succeeded to transform one for the winning of the match.
The rythme was not very supported during this meeting, where the attackers had difficult to express themselves.
According to the first temptation of Captain Kauffmann, who swallowed the lamp on a remote course, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascension and tour to Funderflick from far, and then with Hirn above, the Romans from the bottom of the feet or even Diebold came to chato’s defense of Dannemarie.
At the face, we made a block in the middle of the land and just left Riahi's rest at the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time would be decisive with two occasions signed by Riahi and Temporary for Dannemarie, and soon after the opening of the score for the Illuusians by Marais, well placed to repeat a bal on a first temptation of Diebold (53e).
But the Ilhousiens butter will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be required to repeat the clothes a twelve minutes later and thus leave his companions in digitality.
But Dannemarie will not benefit and will not make big problems to an Illusionian One who just recovered a little to "compact" his defense, excepted in all the last seconds of the game where, after a big coffee, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy at the meeting of wrath fishers
Before he goes to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a turn by Bretagne.
In view of the demonstration of the force of fishermen who had intensely disturbed the access of several British and Normand Ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to become on Thursday at the Gailvinec port in the Finisher to meet their representatives there.
These last promised to accept it "in a constructive spirit" and hope that it would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a General Assembly of the "Christ Committee" created by the British fishers for measures against the gaso prices, which reached a record of more than 1,14 euros per litre.
According to the Elysée David Martinon portfolio, the President will "discover with them solutions that can be imagined to help their enterprises find competitiveness and to ensure the conditions of employment and refund of sea."
Nicolas Sarkozy was expected to be closed by fishers.
Thursday morning, they carried out transactions in the Morbihan and Calvados, with about 10 miles [10 km] bucks.
Kiberon's pleasure port was also locked, but the links to Belle Island were not stopped.
A filtering bargage was running on the nearby island of Quiberon.
The mariners have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, from abode, pneuves and palettes in front of the brest ports, and Lorient, while manifestations were in Concarneau or Saint-Brie.
The movement was spread to other ports of the Atlantic Fazade and Manche, such as the Sables d'Olonne, Vendea, where the chalutiers remained at the kidney, or in Havre, where a 20 battles blocked the movements of trade vessels.
The fishers of La Turballe and Crossic, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped the block of the importance of the total raffinery of Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting on Thursday to decide of any action.
In Guilvinec, the "Christ Committee" must determine on Thursday the follow-up of the movement and its participation in the Ministry of Agriculture and Pesca in Paris.
However, some British fishers do not want to be representatives of the national fishing committee, which did not support their movement.
"The Greeve will continue" because "the fishers will not leave anything" and "not want to move to Paris," Liliane Cariou, for example, announced the president of the Committee on Fisheries in Lorient.
Professional fishers, who do not pay tax on the gasoline, are currently paying about 50 centimeters per litre, but they believe that a ship's rentability level is only achieved with a gasol below EUR 0,30 per litre.

Analysis Paris History of the Morning Meeting Session History Morning Meeting
The New York Bourse accused a historical fall on Monday after rejecting the Paulson Representative Room of Banks: The Dow Jones lost 6,98%, or ever a loss of 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) extended 777.68 points to 1O.365,45 points.

Wall Street has already been depressed at the start of the meeting, after the unexpected refusal from the Representatives of the Bank's backing plan that should have been allowed to find a little stability on the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, the representatives made the means he requested to the Secretary of Tresor Henry Paulson.
Nearly two republicians on three rejected their plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees the Congrès cannot adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, from FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counted on this plan," she said, "which fears that a project adopted in several days would not come "too late".
"If the project is actually dead... then the relais will quickly pass to the Fed (the American Central Bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would make more credit conditions," predicted Brian Bethune, the Economy Chair of Global Insight.
And increased the feeling of emergency, Mrs. Piegza stressed that "all day that passs the loss of a financial institution" to the United States.
According to Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities organized the retraction of Wachovia's activities by its Rival Citigroup.

Obama, winner at the points of the first television dual
In the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the Maison Blanche, another occurred to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, brought it.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign QGs announced their own victory in this television dual that would have been followed by a third of the American family.
The political analysis David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, was not enough "brillant" to enable him to enlarge his lowness in the reviews of five weeks of the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, with a Sunday opinion investigation, gives an advance of five points in Obama (49 % against 44 % in McCain), considers that it is the democratic one who took his game's eye.
In the undetermined electors, who are the accounting, Obama has been winner for 39 per cent of the investigations, while 25 per cent of them give the winning to McCain, a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm its advance on Thursday with the expected performance of her cousin, Joseph Biden, during the first and unique public debate with her rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to subestimate her.
She has good instincts," however, Bill Clinton predicted this weekend.
The Seventh-year McCain had no stops to introduce his indiscutible experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the "naivity" of his opposer on the issues that were in the heart of this first face.
"The Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be the President," he also assured.
An attack angle from yesterday in the republic television publications.
Obama highlighted that he represented the future.
Without demounting, he showed himself concise and precise.
He made his ability to take the right decisions and to restore the picture of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not always understood, while Obama, if," retorned, this week-end, a democratic spot to the Republic of not taking the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American of the street".
"For the fourth-dix minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama said, yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered for a electoral meeting in North Caroline under a rain.
He has not even spoken the words "medium class" or "worker"." The financial degree of Obama's benefit, which is considered by the Americans as the same as to save the economy at the border of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive tourist," he estimated, yesterday, the democratic senator, Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of the Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama with Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current debat is "the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that even to reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans despite Wall Street's sovereignty, the Senator of Itànois also pointed out that the implementation of a potential energy independence of the country by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health security system.
McCain, he wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear centres from here to 2030.
The two candidates have discussed the issues on the plan of financial salvation of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted last night by the Congrès and extremely immobile.
In Minsk, "You noticed that there was a choice, you?"
Young and opponents showed on Sunday night on the main place of the Belarus capital to reject the results of the islatives.
A few hundred centuries of Belaruses gathered on Monday night after the closure of voting offices on the central place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the islatives.
While no result has been announced yet, many young people had come to manifest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, the demission".
Some have not even voted, "What good, because they will do what they want from my voice," said a young man.
They do not believe that the scheme that has made good figures to foreign observators in order to repeat the language with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic tourner.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visibility for 40 Belarus leaders and the ice of certain hairs, could be raised if these elections were considered own by observers.
They did not have the opposition.
"We have been held in the electoral committees and our observators have not been able to participate in the depth," declared Jouri Potemkine, the portfolio of the Democratic Forces Union, a hetherogenic revocation of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change, highlights Alexandre Milinkievitch, the former candidate of opposition to the presidential of 2006 and the head of the pro-European movement, because the importance of the votes, and with us, is the exhaustive power.
If the opposition members enter into Parliament, they will be appointed, not chosen.
But their introduction to Parliament may mean space to television, meetings in regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our economy, which is seriously endeavored to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we are able to become a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independents."
The opposite fears that the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe who followed the electoral process does not implie the validity of the audit.
It highlights that the numbers of participation appear to be too high, and that the generalisation of the vote by anticipation (26 per cent of the electors in Minsk) opened the vote to all manipulations.
"You have noticed that there was a choice, you? ask the social-democrate leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in this year.
There was nobody in the vote offices.
And there will be at least five members of the opposite to Parliament, those who agree to the best of the power."
The silence of the night returns to the place of October.
At television, President Loukachenko and members of the Electoral Central Committee welcome their success.
The interview - of the blood returned secure
Hema-Quebec collected yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and his president, Dre Francine Decary, had the right to rejoice because Hema-Quebec became one of the most safe and effective blood providers of the world.
And especially, he recovered the confidence of the public that had been seriously spread by the blood scandale contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Cross-Rouge Transfusion Service were contaminated by the immunodeficiency virus (VIH) and hepatitis C virus during 1980.
Before this drama and the greenhouse of the public, the Government of Canada established in February 1994 an investigation, presided by Judge Horace Krever, which intended to make light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster would no longer be repeated.
While Judge Krever was late to submit his report, some provinces put up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian blood Society to provide all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Quebec began its activities, almost 38 per cent of people still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, the Dre Decary reminds.
The situation was discouraging.
In efforts to improve the safety of blood and work on the ground during the following years, we rejected the public's confidence," she warmly stated that at the beginning of 2008 nearly 94 per cent of the Quebec population had now trusted in Hema-Quebec.
The Dre Decary, however, keeps the head that "the confidence is something extremely fragile."
From its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec applied the principle of precaution.
At that time, there were many cases in Europe in which the form of hum· the disease of the foolish bowl, a new variant of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which holds strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know whether this disease could be translated by blood.
We were then supported on one of the main recommendations of the Reports of Krever and Gélineau, which, when we do not know and that a serious disease can deal with it, in the case of the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is characterised by the degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, is introduced to exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of persons who had lived more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was held.
But a few years ago, it has been shown out of doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the principle of precaution that we have applied had a meaning."
In 1999 there was a much more sensitive HIV depisting technique on the market: nuclear acid tests (TAN) which allow directly to detect the presence of the virus himself and not the anticorps against the virus, on which the tests were used until then.
The TANs have allowed the muet period to accelerate, which occurred between the time when the person was infected and the one where the first virus could be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce this period to a period below one week.
Thus, substantially, the risk that some donors are infected without knowledge and that they cannot be detected.
These improvements have been allowed to take into account the risk of contracting AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million short is the risk of receiving blood contaminated by HIV.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products should be distributed before someone is infected by HIV.
As Hema-Quebec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a HIV transmission case will occur by a blood product.
I believe that today you can feel to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health," states Hema-Quebec leader.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen will be in the system.
Not later than the past year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which is translated by an insect in the blood inside the West Nil virus.
It must be constantly watchful," the Dre Decary continues before stressing that in more than a security supply, Hema-Quebec must also provide a sufficient supply.
"The needs increase because the old population.
As anticanceral treatments are more aggressive, patients often need reloading in red globules or placebos.
Agement of the population has also effects on the blood suppliers' network that are increasing in average than 3% of the Quebecoes acceptable to the blood supply."
However, everyone in health, 18 years old and more responding to the criteria of admissibility, may give blood every 56 days, or six times per year.
In the meantime, 14 per cent of people who propose their blood are not accepted because they are reached from AIDS or Malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the paludism is located, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"In these 3 per cent, we would keep a inventar that responds to hospital needs.
The penuries are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors must be renewed as they are older and can't give their blood anymore.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donor.
Today's life is so disappointed, it is rarely found time to pass a hour to give his blood," Francine Decary is deceived.
Having an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone plug-ins, heart valves, ocular globes and skin that is almost used for large burning.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and congeled before they are placed at Hema-Quebec who also manages the only cordon blood bank in Quebec.
The ombilical cordon that was already considered as a biomedical decate is a rich blood in socks cells that can use to treat serious diseases, such as leucemy.
"We have celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our milestone blood samples of cordon and we are expected to take more than a thousand per year.
It should be started to propose for grips at the beginning of the next year," says Dre Decary, which describes this programme of cordon blood as very popular.
"Multiple mamans are deceived to have access to it," because Hema-Quebec does not have the way to propose this complex and costful program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Half-Final Effect
The Impact of Montreal has been qualified for the half-final range of the eliminatory series of the first USL division, using a winning of 3-1 (4-3 in total) to the expenditure of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive match of the final quarter series in total of the purposes, in the Stade Saputo.
The area of Antonio Ribeiro has marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
At the first half of one side without purpose, the middle of the land David Texto and Rocco Plan ́no marked the other rows of demonstral training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to enjoy Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that at the first match of the series of return, Friday, the Impact had fallen from 2-1 to Starfire Complex, Tukwila, in Seattle's campaign.
The impact will be measured in the Whitecaps of Vancouver in half-final.
Samedi night at Minnesota, Thunder combined a deficit of 3-1 in the return match to get 4-3, but the Whitecaps have also accessed the half-final 5-4 round to the total targets.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - But Victorieux of Kovalev
The trio number one of Canadian is ready to enter the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 of Canadian winning to the bargage traces in the Panthers de la Florida last night in the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec took two aids, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev has given the victory by marking the only purpose of the fusilade.
"I'm not still ready," the Russian warned.
I need another match to feel like I'm in the knife."
"He tried too much to do in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest put on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
Instead, the General Council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest came to June-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), trying to be elected at the present part of the election.
"Repeat the limits of our last large northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest has presented in the large lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
After him, during his speech, a kind of Moulin was designed to images.
They tourned in bullet, on three large screens, spectacular spectacles of hydroelectric bargage, mine exploitation, from Quebec, given by "Google Maps", cards, etc.
Great means such as in electoral period.
Moreover, the Prime Minister excluded that he would deal with the elections of this automne, even if he noticed that his time was very loaded.
The "North Plan" is the fourth pan of a "visibility" that the Prime Minister Pre-Ministry has for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes an entity on the work with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and Ontario.
Often mentioned in the recent talks of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been subject to a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, was asked to explain why the North was "a joy of the great potential", but he did not give any extent, investment amounts or specific priority in the future projects.
In addition, a few availments of what could be developed more: in particular hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mini-sektor, increasingly by the growth of large countries and restructuring infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, cow, platin, gold, silver, iron, titane, and even diamond", -- the enumeration of Mr. Charest.
This "territory twice big like France", "it's with us, it's in Quebec.
It is not only with us, but it is in us," he insisted, as well to show that he requested a national funding myth.
The Quebec was very built in his relationship with the North, highlighted: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the chebecoe engineering, the Baie James.
"It's for us, it's our future," he said, after having made a theatre pause to think about the large map behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always revoked, specificated the Prime Minister at the pressing point.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which there has been no understanding for a long time and, when the opportunity is present, I repeat this position in the name of the Government," he said.
Moreover, "with climate changes, we must repeat our vision from the Northwest," he said by speaking about the northwest pass, which will be opened all the year because of the source of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupation of the territory is a duty.
What about the residents of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about them and that the project would benefit them, especially for young people.
Two ancient ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ancient Pequist of Hungava), have already started consultations with a thirty communities.
A non-terminist committee presided by Benoit Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has started a significant place.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a top", but a moment when "a common vision will be given."
The development of the North would also be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, ordered and respected for the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visibility" as continuing with the first liberal ministers who had made it.
"So as the liberals that have made us, we thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
In addition, this was one of the recurrent themes from the end of the week, which started on Friday by a big cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's army to the head of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to resume the Beauharnois Centre in Barrage Adellard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, in Lesage, who made the quiet revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa, who made Baie James, our party was able to forget the future," said Jean Charest.
In a pressing point, he called another reference, the Conservative, the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, the Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963.
Through the Eastmain1a-Ruper Hydroelectric Bargage Project, Mr. Charest highlighted that it was planned for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I'm supposed to be there," he confided his soldiers, providing food pleasures with them.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April, that there would be no election in 2008 and, of course, not in 2009, did not separate the possibility of launching an automne investigator, what the law allows him.
He highlights that his time is complete, in particular by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a summit of Quebec-New York.
The General Council of the end of the week provided to the Liberal Chairman a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" which have been passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ claims, in particular, the "speciality of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wishes that Quebec names the members of the Canadian Radio Diffusion and Telecommunications Council and that those lasts have a veto right on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposite, the large lines of the North Plan were accepted with skepticism.
The Pequist leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North-Du-Quebec Development Policy that the Government of Landry had been held in 2001.
It states that the Liberal Government, coming to the power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done it, "We would be more advanced today", Mrs. Marois commented at the side of his candidate in Jean-Talon (scratin today), France Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what we want is that it is not just a spectacle," commented leader Sebastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, who comes from vacations today.
Letters - A Deshonored Land
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of the "Justice" in the Harper cabinet, which allowed the last sea to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "honne" for Canada.
Take the oppression of this woman who has led an inciting fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration is as long as on the surrounding of the Prime Minister and on Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one among all the involved countries that have not repatriated his citizen in the concentration camp of Guantánamo.
A government that doesn't take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts that he was pronounced.
The only government who, despite the signature of the Geneva Convention, rejects his word and allows an unhuman soldier to cross in unhuman conditions.
The only one who returns to a parodia of justice to evaluate the accusation of the accused.
Remember, for memory, that EECCEF, International Amnistie and Canadian Barreau Association, in particular, pleasant for Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a balanced process in Canada.
It is the same government who closes the eyes of torture: it is little to do that a young adult now psychologically destroyed, unless so long after so many years of exactions.
This is not yet aware, but we are currently assisting an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy" that Harper does not stop burning and that sounds so cruel in his mouth.
This is the time when there is no more morality: it can be misleading, tortured, arbitraryly captured a Canadian citizen’s good will of a government leader to this minority (which will then be after 14 October...).
Many electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that prosecuts the Vertu, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has rejected the reputation and dignity of our country.
The damn, Mr. Toews, is here, in this refusal, and not else.
Free opinion - The orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In its edition of 17 September, the Devoir has held a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, President of the Canadian Miner Barrick Gold.
Following a orwellian logic, he states that the largest world's biggest company has intended to prosecute six million against three authors and a small editional house without below in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions in diffamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this difference is completely covered by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would it be the best way to conduct a public debate that would lead to ruin whoever does support a position contrary to his own?
Notwithstanding the outcome of the process, the authors and the editor of the Black Canada book will have to expendire significant amounts in order to prepare their defence and fight, with very unbalanced weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the miner.
The tactic, in these unbalanced fights, is often to destroy defenders in order to impose a regulation to the friends who will deal with the opposite, rather than fearing anyone who is going to do it again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the opinion that she had to present her view of facts.
In contrast with what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are usually through the exchange of ideas, not with maturity.
It was therefore sufficient for the miner to open its books, documents and to establish a real debate through the journals, media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could be able to light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold 日 does not trust the opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could at the same time ask for a "public" debate while deceiving the opinions of the same public?
In the world of the President, it is that this word only shows the loudly paid and not the Canadian lawyers; this is a rather extreme view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, it's that the public supports the authors and editors of Black Canada because he rejects the brutal way of mine.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized trade in arguments, not in the context of what many feel like a prosecution-baillon (continuing the "governmental debat", Barrick Gold comes from the other way to put a residence in the place of black Canada authors to stop the use of this term...).
Besides Mr. Garver's surreal talk, Barrick Gold's consequence is a direct attack against university research freedom and truth seeking, essentially for any democratic society.
It, in block, denied the right to quotation of creditable sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects that move to the rich world's enterprises in a country like Canada, unless repeated prosecutions, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do it according to the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to replique.
The Universal Environment, which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and dealings and to resolve conflicts.
The consequence of Barrick Gold shows that, in contrast with what she predicts, she does not want a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to set up devices that limit such abusive persecution.
Wall Street Saving Operation - Democrats and Republicans are heard
The Bush administration and the Congrès Road Chairs, both the Republic and the Democratic, finally reached an agreement on the largest economic salvation plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion dollars in order to release the financial crisis that has cut Wall Street for months has to be held by the two Congrès rooms.
It provides, in particular, a better control by the elections of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the recovery of the committed public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses entered for payment failure, as well as a right to view the salaries paid to the leaders of the secure enterprises.
The American Secretary in Trésor, Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, last night, at the end of a two-day negotiations marathon.
"We have made great progress for an understanding that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"All has been made in a way to open the real economy and the American Americans of the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the democratic.
"This is the point: if we don't do this, the traumatism, the chaos and pollution on the daily life of the Americans will be great," said the republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the last hours by fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on investors' humor.
The time we had been granted was the opening of markets this morning.
Lately associated with negotiations, the two American presidential election candidates have shown themselves favorable to the audience, however, without the failure of expressing their failure that it is required to reach this extremity.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has assigned to the audience certain provisions, in particular to allow the owners to maintain their home and the payment of the Governing Boards.
"When contributors are requested to take exceptional measures due to the inresponsibility of some, there is nothing to welcome.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television walls.
Asked on another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opposite, John McCain, answered, "I would like to see the details, but I hope yes."
"The great lines I have read [to show] that it is something that we all will have to dig and with which we will be able to go forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The plan of 700 billion intends to buy with the money of contributors the suspicious credits, risk activity and inventory of the American financial institutions.
There is 14 months after a crisis which has been deployed by an immobilious bowl that has led to the exhaustion of risk-hypothiatry credits (subpressions) before it is exposed to other forms of credit-liability (PCAA) and to move on a liquidity gel and on banks and financial institutions deficiency.
It is a group of republican eluses who had made the first hearing project last week.
We believe that we have been out of this impasse since the democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" activities of difficult companies are only guaranteed by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to enlarge the angles for everyone in the Congrès, it was also established that if the Government had to lose for five years with this programme, he could set up new taxes to help her recover her.
The new plan provides for the payment of 250 billion first tranche, which will be able to be 100 billion billion if the Chairman is necessary.
The payment of 350 billion other billion should be undertaken by another vote of the Congrès.
In exchange of its aid, Washington will receive shares in supported companies that will be worth dividends in the case of benefit and that it will be able to return when the tourment will be passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of repealing the procedures of income on residences attached to immobilious loans under this plan, as well as fixing limits to remuneration and refunds payed to the leaders of the affected enterprises.
The texts of the plan would like to see him submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today and to the Thursday Senate.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet sure that their plan will have the green fire.
In fact, votes continued to stand against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and democratic camp.
"It is obvious that Washington doesn't hear you," said to the address of his electors, the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Committee on Finance of the House.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of benefiting from contributing."
An animator of a small group in the Congrès called "Cacus of Skepics", the democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the things otherwise, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economy teachers, including three Nobel Prices, wrote us to say: Congress is asked to not press and consider the way to take carefully," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had a new evidence of the world's nature of crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis Group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of the Eagle, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French BNP Paribas bank said that she refused to purchase its competitor in full ship since she had lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion) in the risk of immobiliary loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not the lost money," said the Netherlands Ministry of Finances, Wo ́ Bos, yesterday.
In exchange, a voting right in the bank and the influence is recovered.
It's just something that the wedding and the household now appreciate that time is uncertain."
At that time, on the other hand of Manche, the British Government seemed to nationalize another bank that was malformed by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the Government would account for the current loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank, including over 41 billion (75.5 billion US) loans.
The Spanish bank Santander reported yesterday that it would buy the sugars and client accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, which the British Government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty in the eyes of aur was a long time his card, some will say his weakness.
If he was released from the narcissic mirror, the American actor's charming smile?
Yeah and no.
His poeder, his ability and a talent that was running from the source will also have removed him from the power record that offers the true holy monsters.
But what a big background!
Paul Newman, missing Friday, at 83 years, followed by a powder cancer in his rand of the Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema for fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he seemed and who was a kind of rival to the Eraran for a long time, more in his game, probably more fragile, but also the apostle of the freedom and the position of dramatic conventions.
Meat blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
These European racines will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without myself, last quality mark.
Because it was designed by a whole country of the self-employed man, the fighter of the war of the Fisheries, wounded in the fight, who at the beginning of the 50s studied the dramatic art in Yale and often of New York's Actor, before triomphing the theater, television, soon to the cinema.
The same man who sold for civil rights was also the car driver classified secondly at the 24st hour of Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, even though member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actor Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of this secret, discrete, engaged, allergic to the show-business squares, which will not actually have the unity.
A honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has gained the grass to the films this weekend, while his great roles are discussed on the black ́s memories.
More than a half-year-old American seventh artist in perpetual mutation declines through it.
They return to memory the charm boy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning tooth adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More closer to us (1990), his sensible Mr. Brie, was devoted by a marriage that did not comply with all his promises.
Many other Paul Newman have passed the story.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, declining, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hate), of Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, which actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathic malfrate in the anticipate The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), player of billion amer and winner, will repeat the personship on return to The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, who worth his only Oscar on nine nominations in 1987.
That face throughout the age was he.
He's back.
Times move through his parking.
Young people know him especially through the Slap Shot culture of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, a hockey team on a little orthodox ice.
His fans found it in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a latest role of the Irish mafia in the Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the buckle was buckled.
In contrast with several films who lost the film quickly soon, Newman will stay long in the sea, while declaring Hollywood, his boys, his feet and his concessions.
The French cineast Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a challenge to "the underplaying" judgeing his too supported performances.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles have fallen for a long time all cooked in the box.
However, he played less often young first than the margins: negrosed, alcoholic, salad or desperate, whose perfect treaties reflect deficiency and rebellion.
As a realist, Newman revealed misknown faces of his real pudic bilidade.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, followed the end of a melancolian woman.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his Harry and Son film in 1984, potter and trial work.
Among the rain of the masters that went on Newman yesterday, his big friend and old friend of arms Robert Redford (they were played in the Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "There has made my life and this best country."
Generosity, existence love is vibrant treats of the disappeared actor.
Moreover, his carrier is a great military for civil rights, ®ology, independent cinema, a counterparty of Hollywood debts.
We will have seen many of his beet troops on vinegarets, socks, biscuits and other foods, judgeing the process of bad asylum go, though gag in the past.
However, the benefits of these ventures were paid to the Fund for childhood in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be engaged to the end.
He left his five girls a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredible of his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege to follow the parking of a American artist so lucid and so generous.
Citoyen model, in sum and up.
What will make Zuschlag & amp; Compagnie in their facilities?
Procedure, on 8 October, will begin auditions relating to the current criminal procedure, against Janos Zuschlag and its companions.
The politicians and its companions are accused of crocheria, in the form of a permanent and regular organization, with particularly important damage. Other accusations leaders were kept against them, such as false and false use.
According to the park, money from subventions was costed for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false factures.
The money of the State and of the municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went from one part in the Fiatal Baloldal movement boxes and, on the other hand, in the pocket of certain people.
Their method, also made by the requested authorities, was to touch the money of the subventions obtained by issueing cost factors, behind which no real performance was provided, and thus the assets never respected their commitments.
According to the accusation act, most of the factures were fake.
For these last, they were looking for factory books on the market of Jozsefváros, while they produced the caches in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were going to figure on the factures, it was decided, inter alia, during the tourned tours in the North Balaton Lake, made by István Lados, on request of Janos Zuschlag.
According to the deposition of this last, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested a factor on the model of which they did the other factors they would, among other things, introduce to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Work, as well as the Capital Municipality to access subventions.
The majority of the factures was created by István Lados and by its companion András 日ri, which implied our information, was particularly concerned about editing the documents necessary to obtain subventions.
When a "reperage circle", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two factors issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the proposals of the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people take this place at the same time.
Similarly, since 2002, the facture established in the name of Jobb Jövért foundation, which then brings the name of Egypt a Harmadik Evezredert, grew in forms and fund errors.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people to pass the night. However, the fax mentioned hundred thirty clients.
The exhibitors of factures to the deborder imagination have also fallen in the excess, when they mentioned the Pigal Kft company, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accountability, not Jobb Jöv'ert, nor the Hoppa's information appeared not.
Gyze’z Farkas, the manager of the company, said to the hvg.hu site that when the parket called him and showed him the factures, he immediately knew that it was fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He said: "Apart from the form, the fact that, according to the fact, hundred people had stayed there was not even, because this establishment has only 11 rooms, which have not so much place.
Moreover, the facture also refers to food, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The elected factory issuers have not yet learned about Budapest's travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but are only travelling to the foreign, so they have naively indicated residences in Hungary on factors to regulate in species, which also refer to the accounting practices of the Agency.
Moreover, as it appeared in the investigation, they also acquired the VAT on these documents, while the provisions on travel activities, which the destination is outside the European Union, are made without TVA.
Similarly, the rate of TVA of the four factors set on the name of the Hotel Revølèp in Jobb Jöv©ért was wrong, since the performance of the company does not support a TVA of 25% as specified, but a 15% TVA. Moreover, the employees of the hotel were only printed, while the fake were edited in the hand.
The parket's request shows that the "emittors" also made errors in mentioning as a result of the transport of goods by road, that the emitting company could not exercise factures, since its profile was the investment Council.
Moreover, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of inadequate factures and false secrets, that the factures issued by the order of Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány, from XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesuelet and Biztos Pont were false.
Like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the sport stage of Kunfeertó, which both do not be the authors of the factures issued in their name.
The faussers did not even take attention to the fact that the HIB Kft, established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (2001) the Fiatal Városert Egyesület group had to take a feed with them. According to our information, this is why the liquidator of the company had not issued this fact.
Factors made deliberately
Another category of factory issuers is the composite of those who were actually conscious that they were asked to issue fiction factors.
The fundation Esély Budapestert Alapitvány, on request of Fiatal Baloldal grouping - Ifjú Szocialisták, established a factor in the order of the Egyut Foundation in Harmadik Evezedert, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the accusation act, the manager of the Collab Kft. was led to issue false factures by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuslags, the Biogate Kft, currently under liquidation and in 2003, issued factures in the order of Jobb Jövért Alapitvány, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Property Vorösfeny日 Egyesület, for a amount of about five million HUF, but after which no performance was actually provided.
No financial movement has occurred, not even because the emissions of factures have been canceled afterwards, but that has been aware that the agencies have avoided to mention it in their accountability.
The following category of faxing companies is the company directly related to accused companies.
Thus, the Administrative Delegate of the Director-General of the Delta Trió Kft., cared for the fuel trade and car vehicles, whose social seat was in Budapest, but where it was incapable, Ivan Kubatov was.
In October, November and December 2005, this company issued several factors on the sale of information equipment for approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the company Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian man, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have made documents relating to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov recognized during the request that he issued factures in the order of the companies of Atlasz, Hoppa and Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány, and that he imposed their counter-value.
It is precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Roman masions created Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, what the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
It also served by these companies, since on the request of Master Zsolt Szente, as well as the editor of the funding acts of the companies, he established factures to their names, in order to relate to Zuschlag, such as Atlasz and Y-generation.
Kubatov gave agencies, 15 factors totally issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14,2 million HUF.
The parque thought that 10 per cent of the amounts indicated on factors and the VAT were going to Kubatov.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fiction factors used under the Biztos Pont subvention request.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generation and Szövetseg in Modern Magyarorzhágért introduced an application for subvention at the use of the socialist party, Tásics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They received this subvention for two times 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the objectives set out in the application.
To avoid that, five factors received from the Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In addition, these factors have been found in the perquisition in the office of Arrd Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education.
In the audience, a part of the accused ones will report the method of manufacturing of factures, as it had already done before the parking.
What could really be interesting would be that the principal accusation, Janos Zuschlag himself, decides to raise the wheel over all the history.
Until now, his grandparents are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the small details, he has not yet done it.
The question is to know whether it is in his interest, or then, possibly, the socialists would have concluded an agreement which, in exchange of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would only take the head.
Today, this latter is probably deceived, since the requests for its supervised residence movement, based on a detention conditions, continue to fall in the ear of a surrounding ear.
Pense that those who have caused much more important damage, and the authors of non-reparable economic crimes are freely or at least waiting for their own home to end the procedure.
Insurance psychology: why do we cost more money?
During winning to businesses, purchasers have the trend to cost more, and to overestim the market.
Neurological and economic researchers of the University of New York succeeded to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their studies in the Scientific magazine, human beings do not want to be remote in this type of competition, for example a sale to eBay businesses, and so they prefer even paying a too high price.
These research tried to bring a neurological scheme of this type of "play" with the help of wins to experimental businesses.
One of the volunteer groups played loto, while the other group participated in a sale to playing businesses, while using a functional magnetic resonance procedure (IRMf), researchers analysed the active cerebral areas of experimental subjects.
In the two games, the participants to win money, but during the sale to businessers whose principal element is the surrounding of one third, the engine is under the cerebral troop, called striatum, was moved in intensive movement during the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, near several other functions, plays a role in the "autostimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
That is why, according to researchers, the assembly of prices is explained with the fleeting before the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economic members of this research group continued financial monitoring analysis.
In these cases, three groups were insured against a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the group of controls of the real value of the product concerned, and thus they made their introduction.
In another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would win the party, they would receive 15 additional dollars, in ree.
While the third group received the $15 before the businesses, the members of the group also lost this money, if they lost the businesses.
The difference between these two groups is actually that the accent was placed at one on the victory, while at the other on the failure.
Thus, by proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players were available to higher places than those carried out by the Control Group and the "for the Victory".
"The results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them did not explain the fenoways found in winning businesses only by enjoying winning and stoping before the risk.
Only the methods of neurological images have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories, now, on a third explanation." - found Andrew Schotter, professor of the faculty of the economic sciences of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about half billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, the chronic disease of the fee is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated to 100 miles of hepatitis hepatitis portors in Hungary, but only seven miles follow a treatment. This is because the diseases often don't know that they are a virus portors.
Hepatitis name is a generic name given to infections affecting feed and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of fee and yellow are characteristics, but the pathogenic agents and the generated diseases are different.
Hepatitis viruses, patogenic genes, are mainly propagated in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other organic liquids (sperm, vaginal secretion, salive).
For travelers, it is always recommended to vaccine against virus A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, generally associated with a bad general state, weakness, stomac and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white eye a glace, the salts become more low and the urine takes a more deep color. The curion can take two to three weeks.
Throughout the world, each year, a million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as the cancer or surrhosis of the fee accompanied by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one of the ten diseases receives a medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to a cirhosis or cancer of the feed.
Most of the diseases do not know the virus, because the pathogen gene destroyes the fee cells in a way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, a preliminary prevention is very important, as well as regular depistage tests.
Inflammation is much higher than the average of a three-group population: people who have increased blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million patients are numbered with chronic C hepatitis in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a laboratorial routine examination, it is recommended to consult your doctor treated after the observation of unknown symptoms of origin.
The disease may be healthy, if it is detected at time. The virus can be eradicated from the humme, so the risk of counterfeit is disappeared and the development of a cancer is prevented.
On 30 September, hepatitis is the World Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by the representatives of the diseases of the four corners of the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to the chronic furniture cirrose caused by virus, the causes of its development and the importance of the previous disease.
Does he who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious faith would work as a kind of analgetic, which would have already contributed to more sustainable death of Catholic martyrs.
The British Telegraph day has made an article which the researchers of the University of Oxford have performed an interesting experience by analyzing the level in which faith in God could influence the tolerance of the pain of human being.
In the context of this experience for at least strange, 12 Catholic believers and so many athes were subjected to electrochocs, while each of them observed a penting representative of the Virgin Marie.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of the souffrance.
Thanks to a human brain pampation technology, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, in which the academics, scientists, philosophers and theologists participate from different sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experience is in the following way: a tool that emits the electrochocs and distributes the electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the experience participants to look at two paintings supported, one of the Vierge Marie pained by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady to the heritage penned by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers from the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Vierge Marie is a kind of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's penting, not very different from the first, was on its disappointing effect.
The experimental subjects have spent a half-hour in a IRM scanner, and during this time, 20 electrochocs in four parts have succeeded, while looking at the religious, or the most general topic.
The Catholics said that, in view of the Old Marie, they felt "in safe" as someone whose "will be careful" and "will be calm, and peace envahired them."
In view of the creation of religious thematics, they realized 12% of pain unless they looked at the work of Leonard.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the experience, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the athletes, with the condition of finding the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, anglican episode, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and, in many cases, effectively change our personality," Wright said.
According to these excellent results, is the question of knowing what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if it is shown to the believers a Madone pained by Leonard or a painting of the same calibre?
Would the view of a Best Marie of Quality result in better results?
You're what you're talking about.
At the time of his tenth anniversary, Google states that it can be found at the bottom of the pocket of people in the same title as the sky above their head. He knows where they have passed their vacations, what specialists they consult and what are their interest centers.
However, it is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of the society.
While with regard to the skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horrible vision, these are just not seeing the importance of the 2.0 web.
Eric Schmidt said, a few years ago, in the Financial Times, that the main ambition of Google is to raise more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can comply with their original goal that sounded as follows: "Let us get all the information of the world in a system!"
According to the Google leader, after ten years of a world chambering work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to treat all information.
The question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt answered that he would like Google to answer questions such as "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that would be better for me?" But the software will not answer this kind of question, simply in the first view, that the day they will know enough about the users.
It is not perfectly responsible for all internautes that the words used during the Internet search, the IP address of the computer that launchs the search and the pages followed by the interested ones are precisely recorded.
By means of the Customized Search Programme Two years ago, users can store their own research history and can consult what they have searched on. Thanks to this, long-termly, recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give many more personal answers, and will submit us products and services based on our statements and stored preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? They ask users who are concerned about seeing Google information monopol.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the society that can survive of fear, and it is not the refund, fear of punishment, desire of freedom, or possibly the revolt against the power that can lead to an antireaction among the internautes.
However, it is confirmed that search terms are not only recorded, but in cases justified, they are transferred to a third, and in such a case, nothing protects the personal rights of the internal.
The most recent example of these times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedo’s pedo, during which Google transmitted to Brazilian government the information he had collected on the page named Orkut, thus enabled an identification.
The concernful interviews of the rights of the person were able to make a suspect of delay last May, when Google, arms on the ground with the EFF EFF legal protection, proved his right to the Court against the FBI. According to the judgment made in the future, Google will not always be able to be binding by any of the points of the constitution to distribute information on the secret request of the FBI, in any way.
(In the same time, the Federal Government had successfully received some 50,000 web addresses and 1.000 research terms that he had received in relation to the strengthening of the child protection law, voted several years ago, but at the end, he did not find the search lists of private users, nor the entire list of websites and key words of these two last months.)
Thus, the judgement of Google is pretty contradictory: it is confused by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intime spher and their private area are suffering when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack themselves in the spirit of rebellion that we manifest against the proud multinational societys of their conservation image.
During this time, the American geek culture and its "savements" gathering passionates, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of the large companies, the "corporation" by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as a world-invaders because of Windows, even if both are in the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, contrary to Microsoft, does not ask his users of identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the software package, continually updated, has a much more accessible, younger and cool effect, in view of the official software management practice.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problem relationship between the rights of the person and the Internet, and what the most proclaimed key word of these last years is right behind him.
In fact, the web 2.0 does not matter anything else than the Propertyation, the fact that we are intentionally left tracks behind us, and that we serve communications channels to us, and while the dimension of these changes is one by one, the key remains the same: we are exposed.
A young, generally, can have a profile on several pages from Facebook to Xanga, and it can even connect these to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, reading its musical habits. Then he can link them to a prosecution system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which automatically appear their recent photo gallerys on Flickr or on Picasa.
Penso that we can learn many examples, such as the girlfriend who easily understands the photographs of the morning, taken by the common circle of friends, with whom his faithful friend passed the evening, or the company who licensed one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog on the top management, we can be on one thing: the private term of life is to review from our day.
Whoever lives in a online life is consistent of what he shows of himself, and so we can define the principle that is hiding behind the behavior of young people today.
He wants to hide something, or at least, he wants to try to convert the Google monopol, can do it (e.g. by starting with Scroogle using the Google search system, but at the same time, not intending to leave any track).
The number of people who, deliberately, are not recorded on pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not less. Google services online, by the processing of text to the image process, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not ratified to large server parks and who do not have our best profile, which has been available until this day.
The opinion expects, without really hiding it, the time when Google will develop his real nature.
The company, with its current value of 156 billion dollars, is more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense public areas threaten the number of businesses of publicity agencies, while the performance introduced to a more important speed is not only to Microsoft but to many other computer programme creators.
However, critical observers, on the other hand, find contradictions with concernful effects: for example, the top management of the company has, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after doubled the price of the maternity and after the company has considered too honestly the multi-day restoration, taken anywhere. All of this is depending on the fact that in 2006, Google has purchased before the Chinese government and after the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good goe and the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of the society, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is sure, in the next months and next years, they will move the world on new points. Some think that the project of scan and archiving books and magazines of Google takes so important dimensions that the company will not be in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, others tremble before his health system, because in this way, we can build a full medical benefit from our results of previous analysis, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google ups a genetic database can give a good primary material to the next generation of scientist-fiction authors. The Roman of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half tons of orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be added in an efficient way only through Google data.
Two minors helped to avoid the tracks of the dual killer of Ozd
"The police invited two minors to ask them in the case of the dual murder of Ozd. According to suspicions, they helped to avoid crime tracks."
Young people have recognized the facts they are blamed, and they are accused of complication.
The two minors, which, according to MTI, are young girls, are free.
The complication of murder can lead to a detention settlement that can go up to five years.
The suspect of the double killer of Ozd, a 23-year-old young man, was placed in provisory detention on Sunday.
The guests of accusation against him are multiple murderers, committed with premeditation and by interest.
Inquiry, it proved that the 23-year-old young man had a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to fix his debt, and it was why he would attach his creditor, last Thursday, to a site of Ozd where he killed him, as well as the girl of this man, who was nine years old.
According to MTI information, the young man predicted his crime, and the weapons with which he would commit his hidden crimes on the places of crime is the evidence.
The police examines the weapons and circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Varsovie's boss makes a proposal for the raising of Prague's bowl
Warsovie's values were proposed by two hundred million euros, approximately five billion Czech Crowns, for 100% of Prague's action package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the President of Varsovia's values, confirmed this proposal that the Polandians did, despite that the Czechs, in fact, excluded Varsovie's circle of the new potential owners of Prague.
The cause of this exclusion is that the barrier of Varsovie is in the hands of the State.
99% of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State who wants to separate from more than 60% of its actions in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech Economic Day E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made until now for the rabat of Prague.
According to the Czech press, Vienna's beach, Nasdaq's transatlantic bowl, Stock Exchange of New York, London's beach and Deutsche Börse have made a offer until this day.
Peter Koblic, manager of Prague, said last week that among the interested, Varsovie's new owner would be the least good owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could result from the disappearance of Prague's beverage in the future.
The value of Prague's bubble is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech corones by the market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between actors, some 90 per cent of papers would be sold.
The most important owner of Prague is the investment bank of Patria Finance, with approximately 25 per cent of participations followed by 14,7 per cent of the Ceska Sporitelna bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5 percent.
Financial crisis in the view of the European press
In their comments on Thursday, on the international financial crisis, the European press leaders have already called "second 11 September".
"The global financial catastrophe, it must be to the American President," accuses the Roman daily, the Republic. "The President has not even been able to block with its own part behind a proposal of law, unprofit to the va-vite, aiming to bring secure to an unexpected situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the evokator warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about one second September 11.
A part of the Madrilène press is also seen the issuer buck in Washington.
According to the view of the El Mundo quotidienal, these are the lack of the political direction that brought the World Economy to the border of the flood.
The risk of enlargement of the American financial system is increased every day, and then the whole world will pay the strong price.
Bush's plan was far from being perfect, however, according to the vote of the congress, a real threat, which Washington does not propose political tools to treat the crisis.
The world economy depends on the empty, just at the time in the capitalism history, one of the largest transformations is happening.
We can't ignore the threat longer - highlight the Geneva's Days-Indexer.
Some states may still have a backup for their tituous financial bodies, and by the money of their contributors, they can save them from failure.
Of course, if more banks grow like dominos, neither financial means nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In long term, we need the states of the European Union to do little cases of their national egoism and to centralize the control over divided financial markets.
Nothing on Monday, the weak financial agencies received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Venusy Day, Der Standard, which fears and fears which also European contributors will have to put their hands on the pool, very deeply, similar to Americans in order to remediate to the crisis, become more real.
To this end, the EU has not really been occupied with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is partly over the old continent.
The "supporters" should not immediately burn hundred billion euros, in contrast, if they noticed in which case it would be rational to touch the money of the contributors, with the aim of preventing greater deficiencies.
The smart car follows the board's flight
What would be better to develop ability to avoid an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
As for example, the one of the beaches.
In the amazing project presented in the CEATEC, with a place in Japan, the bourdonnante beaches gave the strategy of department to the Nissan engineers to inspire them on how they must design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
With the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini-Robot car, a bio-inspired auto-roboted command system, of type BR23C, which has equipped the quality of the beaches, the final goal is to promote the establishment of a system that can avoid all obstacles.
During its flights, each abeil is its own space, in oval form, which actually is a lot of our safe protection cock - explained, during the exposure, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the Department of Research and Development and Marking Relations.
The eye on the faces of the abeille plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the eye to faces, the engineers overcome the idea of the telemeter to laser.
This identifys the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the board microeur, which converts it to the immediate avoidance manager.
The perception of the obstacle occurs in a fraction of second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the moves of the abeille, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning to a sufficient angle to avoid the evacuation.
In contrast to any existing system, this operation of avoidance is completely instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the mini auto robot could not respond quite quickly to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must respond instinctly and instinctively, since this corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal coast of the protection envelope, a box where instantly the employment is considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the abeil does to avoid the other abeilles.
The process must be rolled in an eye clip.
On the contrary to the beaches, the difference cannot go up, down or in diagonal, it can be only two dimensions, and only in the direction where the wheels can turn.
Instead of the infinite combinations that have the beaches to avoid the other beaches, in our case, it was only possible to use rotative movement, acceleration and ralencing as handwerks to the mini robot mini
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries which are more powerful and whose energy is greater, which makes their life longer than in Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, this is the intellectual instinct reaction that is primary, not the processing of data, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only be treated by a few signs in second and react to these.
It is not necessary to store them and react them with the intuitive logic based on the data of previous workers, so it uses only some dozens of kilo-bytes of memory continually.
We don't need memory for giga-octets, nor even mega-octets.
This is the first step to the design of an instantious avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its input into the cars in series in the next ten years.
Another application may be its integration in the GPS satellite navigation system so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding the obstacles on his path.
We even gave a name to the baby out of price
The written version of the economic salvation plan of $700 billion, intending to buy duty credits from the banks, and to use several times, is ready.
At first, half of this sum will be costed.
Re·s announced that during new debates, long-term after midnight, Sunday, local coast time, the Congrès leaders have agreed on the existing conflicts since days, around the safeguard plan of $700 billion.
"We have made a serious step before" said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Chamber of the American Representatives, and it remains only to put the agreements on paper.
The commitment, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The American Secretary of Tresor, Henry Paulson, stated by commenting on the results of the commitment that the programme will work and will be effective, however, other measures must still be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not questioned, here, from Wall Street's salvation, but to turn the economy's roads in the other sense.
The written version of the plan was published before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday at 20th, Washington's local hour (that is Sunday at 2th morning, the local time of Central Europe), but it did not cause spectacular mount in the bourses.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote in the proposal of a law in accordance with the name of the Law on an emergency economic stability in 2008, and then its outcome will be within the hands of the Senat.
Samedi night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the House White also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with progresses this night, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the portfolio of the White House.
In addition, the programme diverged from the initial proposal made by the Bush Administration, which mentioned that the 700 billion dollars were solely expensed for the recovery of dumped credits.
The first 250 billion will be released immediately after the adoption of the law by the Congrès, probably on Monday. This first sum will serve to the secretary of the Tresor to buy doubtful credits from the banks, while the use of 100 billion additional dollars will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be monitored by an independent agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The cost of the second half of 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congrès.
In the meaning of the law, the secretariat of the Treasur may establish a combined strategy: it can, at the same time, buy doubtful credits, titles on hypotheches and doubtful hypotheches, and other types of "toxic credits".
The competent persons of the Minister have stated that the refunds may be made in the framework of a sale to businesses, but also directly.
The rule provides the opportunity for the enterprises concerned to participate in an insurance programme, where the secretariat to the Tresor guarantees the tools for concerns, for which companies will have paid a premium equal to pre-damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools in order to sanctify $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, that it is the large amount of doubtful credits, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system that leads to the exhaustion of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions to be ready to apply the law after it is signed," he said.
On the contrary, bank leaders who are in bad postures and waiting for the State's help can wait for their department recompenses, which are called just golden outside-Atlantic parachute, will be plafoned by the Government.
The planning of the salaries is only mentioned in specific cases, and the limitations deepen the way the secretariat proposes its aid to the company.
The principle of the planning means that if the secretariat to the Trésor buyes in the framework of a sale to the businesses, they will provide a overall tax on the golden parachute, unless the President of the discreet bank is part of the retraite.
The Government will act aggressively after the recovery of doubtful credits to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exceeded.
In order to complete the image, it is necessary even if existing donated parachutes are not available. Plafoning is only the new contracts, this is to motivate the participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that the general directors' nominations will be implemented - the Chairman of the Committee on Financial Affairs, Democracy Barney Frank.
In addition, the State has a right to purchase parts in the banks involved in the plan, so the risk of contributors is decreased, since they can even win in the case since the economy and with it the saved banks will return on their patterns.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the Chairman must introduce to the Congrès a proposal that will establish how losses will be returned to contributors from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts in relation to this plan.
This is not why the American citizens have sent us, this does not protect the dollars of contributors - said the Republican Member of California, Darrell Issa.
Her democrate of Ohio, Mary Kaptur thinks that they are the same ones who press the measures to take, as those responsible for Wall Street's exhaustion.

The next year, will we still need visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz thinks that there are good chances for the US-Hungrian agreement to enter into force on 12 January. This is what the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated to Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
It states, "continuing, everything depends only on the time when out-Atlantic electronic systems will be in service."
At the same time, she focused on the fact that in the new system there will be no input visa, but the tourists will have to register before the department.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Condoleidad Rice, to whom he will submit the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Star of the Order of the Defense of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign advisers of the candidates at the presidential, the democrate Barack Obama and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support both the bank salvation plan
Saturday, Barack Obama, as John McCain, candidates to the presidential of the two major American parties, provided their support for the 700 billion government salvation plan. However, there are politicians who require the demission of the American Secretary to the Tresor.
Following marathon negotiations that have held days and days, the representatives of the Congrès and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday, that they have concluded principles agreements on the plan of salvation of banks.
This funding plan, aimed at dealing Wall Street's crisis and paralyzed credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are even present, each more appreciated than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest reviews, Obama, with the advancement of economic issues, has succeeded once again. McCain's progress, obtained with Sarah Palin's nomination as a colister just after the Republic Convention, was found.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit, Sunday, Obama expressed his hope of seeing the Congrès rapidly voting on 700 billion salvation law.
He highlighted that the proposal contains the transitions for consumer protection that he also supports.
"This is now that, with responsibility... a danger threats your work, your economy, all industrial sectors and the stability of all the economy," he stated before a multitude of 35,000 people.
McCain's economic ideas of overseas were not missing.
In an interview given to the ABC chain, McCain said, "We'll all have trouble to get it... but nothing to do is not a way possible."

Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, stated on Monday that there are serious hopes that the House votes on the legislative proposal from Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right camp is intake, it is only in the heart of the party that electors have become more conscious - so the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the German Left Information Journal, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic disappearance of the CSU in its article titled "The Revolution in Bavera feeds his fathers".
According to this recognised polytolog, the CSU erosion started soon before the trist of the Beckstein-Huber takes its functions.
Christian socialists have transformed the Bavier for decades and now, they are the same modern citizens who turn their back.
This change at the same time is the problem of all the Christian democracy, and this is the fact, also the Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not actually a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that had been ended, just ten years ago: the indispensable hegemonie of the national party has been completed.
It was 10 years ago, in 1998, that CSU was 47.7 per cent, and this for the first time since the fifty years, with a score below the level of 50 per cent.
This was repeated three years ago at the elections of the Bundestag 2005, which is, in the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause may be emphasized by modernization of "devoring his parents" in the region consisting of the CSU.
It is 40 years old that sociologists announce this, but they were strongly disappointed about the rythme, but secularization, the results of the education and the establishment of northern and east Germans in the region of Bavery, in full development, could not remain unconsequently on the faithfulness of CSU electors.
A modernization is going to match opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also .
The right camp is intake, it is only within the party that electors have become more conscientious, more critical and more entitled.
It is also surprising that during these last weeks, it is just the groups of classic citizens who have been rather remote from the CSU, such as independents, artists, holders and graduates of higher studies.
In these groups, the support to the CSU was under 40 per cent.
The press (depresse.com)
In its article titled "Who? Abec who? The President of the Parties stands on the reservation of the coalition issues," the Austrian conservator daily takes care of the situation of the confused internal policy that has been installed after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ's socialists want to discuss with ÖVP conservators.
The ÖVP prohibited the SPÖ to deal with its internal business.
The BZÖ Popular Party is open for negotiations, and the green don't want to agree on coalition yet.
Elections have occurred, now all around coalition; during television-organized debates, partial leaders do not allow their cards to enter.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the OVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the ability of the two parties is effectively possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and social partnerships.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as a chainer, remains open by Faymann.
As he mentioned it, the direction of Schüssel-Molterer was, in any case, rejected.
A replication of this combination is out of question.
Molterer reacted with devotion to the proposals of red.
As he already said, a employment will certainly be unfruitful if Faymann is trying to enter into the internal business of the OECD.
In its part, the choice of opposition or entry into coalition is at the moment a very open question. These points must be absolutely discussed within the OECD.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
"To avoid coalition of red and black, we are ready to exercise governmental responsibilities" said Hader.
Jaróka said: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Supreme for Equality of chances, whose host is France, as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message expressed before the plenary assembly, as one of the main portfolio of expert consultation, Livia Jaróka, European Fidesz People's Party, took attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right that affects the most Roman children and that, one of the main mains of their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Ministry of the Work and Social Affairs, and, on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner, Social Affairs and Equality of chances.
Among the people invited to participate in the consultation, European social partners and the most eminent representatives of legal protection and European civil agencies are found in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Group of Fidesz Popular Party, Jaróka warned that, on the side of the distinctions found at the ambassadors, the romes disappeared from the work market, first after their low qualification.
"A splendid majority of young roms have no secondary diplomas, and due to a fundamental education of bad quality, only one infime part has the possibility of a higher study diplomacy."
In addition, Jaróka insisted on the fact that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role when other rights must be valided.
Investment in the former education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the European Parliament, it is necessary to make aware of these reports in a most largely possible circle, including between roms and non-roms.
In fact, soon a Roman child begins the oil, more he increases his chances to become a productive member of the work market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"From their nationality of the European Union, the romes must be assured of their right to quality education and be protected from low-quality and sectary education."
According to the lawyer, a European Union's ability to a goal and an action is necessary for immediate acceleration of the school desegregation process, which is primarily important for the compliance with existing antidiscrimination and preparation directives.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and we need to give the possibilities of democracy to the Roma children so that they can participate as citizens of full right to the future of Europe," Jaróka requested.
On behalf of the European Year for the Equality of Chances for all, the objective of the Supreme Affairs Equality in Europe organized each year since the summit in Berlin last year is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken for the equality of opportunities and the fight against discrimination at European level and at the level of Member States.
CSU: Grace for a transition period
It is in October that the decision on the extent of the dual dechu Huber-Beckstein will be taken.
Despite this swimming electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the tops of the Bavarois CSU has been updated.
The President of the Party, Erwin Hube and the leader of the Regional Government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The loss of the tendem, with a loss of a catastrophic voice of 17 per cent, will be on the order of the congress of the exceptional party, held in the last week-end of October.
The members of this very criticized couple, in any case, have felt that they were not especially at their seat.
As a result, they worked to pass the furious members of the fraction and the base, which once after the "sunami bavarois" had required personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
This is five years ago - it is true, yet under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union was 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the puzzle against Stoiber, it remains only 43.4 percent of their force.
The CSU was the only "sovereign" of the Bavery who gave 18 per cent of the German PIB.
However, the conservators are still strong in this South region, which is key to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be responsible for coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal review of the party, the President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible follower of Huber, also received a place in this modesty group of employment, which initiates discussions with the freedoms of the FDP, as well as the Free Electors, formed as the right values, on a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nose of the destination was that by the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli legislation, which was the measurement against Stroiber, the possibility of putch perpetuated by Duo Huber-Beckstein, to then treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without meditation.
Now, the CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in a way or in another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who was currently throwing the boxes in the cowls, will also receive an active role. The former leader of the Regional and Ex-President of the CSU was appointed on 28 September as the most amazing day of its political career.
On Monday, Huber launched a few observations to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the deficit as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following Bundestag's elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will be able to be a chancealer only if they leave on a way or on another, with a common force, the CSU, playing a important role in the 2005 national success.
According to Merkel, hiding hardly his deception caused by the fiasco, the CSU land loss will not affect the great Berlin coalition.
However, what is related is because it will not be easier to manage the hurt CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democratics is always too sustainable.
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18,6 per cent in Baviera.
Lucenko - its Âaux : 110 - 0
No members of the opposition accepted the Belarus Parliament after Monday elections.
According to the Russian observators, this is explained by a country managed by Alexandre Lukashenko, which provides it for prosperity and stability, while, according to the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe (OSCE), it is explained by illegalities committed during the delay of votes.
The OSCE, sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize elections.
Although the isolation of 110 people in this country of 10 million residents has been very well opposition from long decades before the elections of yesterday, the unity of its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) would hope seriously that Lukehenko, renewing its mandate of president for the fourth time during doubtful elections, on the tracks of the change in the constitution in 2006, would "to allow" this time the presence of some Members of the opposition to the parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ rejected its boycotte for origin.
The fact that Belarus, economically more depending on Russia, would want to improve its reports with the EU, where, due to the qualified antidemokratic antidemocracy policy, Lukehenko and several highly placed politicians not receiving input vision, was one of the expectations of opposition. The Belarus has taken a credit due to the reduction of Russian natural gas imports, and thus contributed to the transition of the Beltransgaz society, owner of gas drives through the country, has passed into the Russian hands.
The fact that the OECD, during the campaign assessment, focused on positive changes instead of missing, such as the prohibition to present for a third of the candidates to the opposite, refer to a preliminary passion.
However, Monday OECD had already contested the campaign, during which the majority of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and especially the fact that the opposition could not be present during voting.
Despite all this, the opposite feels like a deep improvement in the political regime: the political prisoners found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small comparisons with Moscou, always recognizing the South Ozezia and Abazzia separate from Georgia. However, Russia, with whom the Belarus is a paper confession, considers both independent territories for a month.
"We have made two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important is that the dialogue has been decorated between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch to our journal.
According to the candidate to the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that this remains, despite "the power has been afraid in this Parliament that has no weight, to make even one opposer".
The opposition does not provide protests in view of the results, but it is trying to make its message on the need for economic reforms to the electors.
"Of course, we have many concerns on this side: we must print our opposite journals in Russia, local authorities put us bottles in the roads for the distribution, but I can also find that they are more supporting elections, even in the circle of old people," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Luchenko, which considers social security as its main result, the cover of the most supported officially does not consider it as appropriate.
"When the country's delay and the growth of the trade deficit, the exhaustion of social security, "decreasing the silence of a cimetr" is only a time question," Milinkevitch states.
In contrast with the opposition policy, the Russian observers have qualified democratic elections.
Serguei Lebedev, managing the Community of independent States, said to the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in words but in acts."
Brunetta: "From today, a little dinner before the work."
In the history of the Palais Chigi, we never had turning gates for the income and output of the employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the small malicians, which points against and then drinks the café in the bar during the hours of work.
The new anti-fair newness has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council's President Mauro Masi.
"The turning gates-ra Brunetta- are a tool for better work, with more productivity, more presence and more services", states the Minister.
Now start a new responsibility and transparency session.
"It's the reform" is also underlined in Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Council's Presidency is completed with the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning gates is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees has been recorded, assured by the Secretary-General: "This is a process shared by employees, and we have all the workers."
Soon, more than small breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests with a smile, "a good cappuno at the 7th morning is a great and healthy resolution."
At a Conference to the Supreme School of Administration
of Rome, the Minister, that 'in three months, the disabilities of public employees have been reduced by 50%, or more than 60 million employees in a year'.
And it is necessary to make more effective, the Public Administration .
Italian, "for the salarial dynamics," explains the Minister - in the past 8-10 years have doubled the private sector, and also the inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees agreed to contest the standards of Brunetta decree with the Codacons.
"which the Ministry of the Public Function today has the data on the decrease of absentism on the workplace because of disease- written the consumers - the people of "active fairs" continue to be .
In Italy, thousands of right and productive public administration employees gathered to declare war to illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exemption of additional allocations in cases of inheritance for service is contested; the prolongation of the hours of residence of the sick worker's household, during which control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Age on the workplace, Napolitano: "Crecial Prevention"
Each day, in Italy, 2,500 work accidents, 3 dead and 27 people remain invalid.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that the white dead was about 00.
Numbers showing the severity of the phenomena that remain one of the main causes of death and cause almost twice more death than murderers.
In order to take attention to institutions, social forces and means of information on this dramatic aspect, the glorious Anmil today, in all Italian provinces, the sixteenth National Day of Affairs on Work, instituted on October second Sunday.
"The concernful data distributed by Anmil and the tragic events of these last days confirm the importance of the prevention on the workplace," states the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to the Chairman of Anmil, nationality of the mutilated and invalid workers, Petro Mercanda.
The Chairman of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continuous associative effort for the prevention of workshops, the protection of accidental workers, the assistance to victims' families and the opinion of the victims.
"Naturally indignantly, everyone struck the poing to end such tragedies that, by their dimension, highlight the claim of media and the participation of the opinion, even if the daily reality presents us dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamic.
Napolitano does not hide that there is a resource problem: it is important to invest in training and information.
Many initiatives promoted in the school sector are particularly important for more direct consciousness than young people in the world of work.
It is our debt, maintaining attention to this phenomena, not under evaluation of social gravity, applying and improved isolation standards.
On its hand, the President of the Room Gianfranco Fini highlighted how much this phenomena of white dead is an absolute social urgence, which injuries the conscience of each of us, and imposes all institutions to make a concrete effort to quickly end there."
The data of accidents on the work reports a positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white dead is still impressive" subsequently highlighted the President of Anmil Pietro Mercanda.
"We don't want that this "bearing to rabai" is actually translated in a lower attention, because it's just when the attention is relaxed, which comes to tragedy.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomena of accidents and the contrast can be done by various actions."
"Meranda- more inspections and inspections are needed, as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this from the oil."
- He said, "the need to make a further effort to communicate and acquire the opinion.
"But, especially, a greater sense of the responsibility of employees against a phenomena that represents a social emergency."
" Mercanda's then stated "the progressive detection of the conditions of safeguard of the indemnity for the victims of the work" and the "aid result in which the system is oriented in recent years".
"The objective is, therefore, to return to the worker the guarantee of assurance – it has made it so that the destination of one who has an accident should not depend on spontanism or the extent of the islator"
Reader Mp3 pointed from the finger, they risk the audience.
Listen to full volume music during a long period using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent lesions to the audience.
This is what the European Commission announced, which, in a broadcast in Brussels, refers to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unpredicted and recently identified health risks of the EU (Cssseri) today.
" of this scientific report - we read in the note - 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to the full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per week, risk a permanent loss of auditive capacity."
"I am concerned that a number of young people who often use musical devices and mobile phones with full volume can unconsciously damage their audience in a non-reparable way," Meglena Kuneva states.
"With the scientific data, the responsible for Ue is a risk and we must respond quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumers and provide such information on public areas.
In addition, we need to review the existing control systems as regards the scientific opinion, so that they are completely effective and can follow the news"
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, taking into account the intensive use of portable musical devices and the number of youths exposed to the voice that they generated.
"The scientists-conclude the ex-effective Ue- confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties, which measures may be adopted for better protection of children and adolescents, against the exhibition of the voice from portable and similar musical equipment.
There is already a European security standard that limits the volume of musical devices to 100Db, but the concern increases the auditive damage that could result from an exposure to such voice sources.
It is possible to limit these data that result from solutions such as reduction of levels and duration of voice exposure.
The Scientific Committee Ue notes that the users of portable musical apparatus, who listen to the full volume music ( more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits for the maximum volume level in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions during long-term periods risk a permanent loss of auditive capacity after 5 years.
This is interested in 5-10% of the users of these apparatus, and their number can be quantified at around 2,5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germany ordered to leave the Commission for the future of capital.
Today, we start, in March, we end, in June we'll take them out.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the travels of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning, at the new seat, behind the Termes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will set up the directives for Rome.
On March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Common Council will evaluate the analysis and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategy Plan for Rome with the " Official Timber " of the Capitol and Master Gianni Germanno.
"The Committee is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there--which is intended to highlight Germany - it should propose ideas of development of Rome, which will be able to use the political decision-making, remaining the Committee and the Common Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a specific period of time.
In June We will present the strategic plan of the work made by the Commission for the future of Rome of Capitale. "
For those who accuse the Commission to be unusual, since its opinions will not be related, Germany replies: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France, by the Commission Attali, as elsewhere in Rome, I am sure, it will be adequate.
Policy is too often accumulated by the management of daily and emergencies that are on time.
Instead, we want to see from before, and far far, to a deeper perspective, working seriously in Rome's development and its future."
Moreover, the Master of Rome is intended to highlight that "This Commission is not an unusual body or a bureaucratic engine: it is absolutely free and will not cost an euro to the Romans, and will serve to study and participate in the best practices expressed by the capital.
For Germany, in fact, "there is needed a strategy, neither close nor immobile, to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, thinking about her future, ".
A future, which, expressed by the Master of Rome, "no limits to the common borders, but will look far away" not only in the optical of the future City of Metropolitan and its legal status of Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
"Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, part of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and reported (as it still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks against Obama increase while the date of elections is approached.
A Lady of Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really cool: he believes he will win the highest function of a nation that accounts in all, two governments and five black senators!"
In fact, it is an attack that does not say much; they are evidently racial attacks, and are not answering the question of all electors: will it be a good president? We have also the reviews, which all say that Obama will win and with good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A magazine of Mississipi, in the south of the United States, wrote a article: Once in the vote cabin, we know who the American patriote will give its vote.
This is a aspect of the American mentality held secretly to the end.
"Tell what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swore: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Elections never shown until now, as the success of the black candidate almost certain.
On the other hand, despite all these reasons, the winning card for democracy is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What were the errors made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 billion soldiers and was sent back to her at the feast.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost life, and the Americans have not been forced to make valises.
Despite this, Iraq was for most of Bush's weakness point.
Who's gonna take George W's place will have a big shot to perform.
Usa, the economic debt feels even with journalists: in the press, it is the time of elimination. And many accuses the Internet, this "eye" of the journal paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interpelled by the ÂW Research Center on the status of their professional and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimists about their future.
However, they have not openly declared to those who are attached to the information, feeling less concerned about the credibility.
They don't feel isolated sometimes.
The problem of American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis in 2008 for these journalists is a devastated economic model crisis.
Moreover, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work at the newsgroom, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, and the interviewed journalists, if you want the traditional journalism such as the great public to be reduced, does not decrease accordingly.
A clear but complex pessimism envahis the American journalism.
Six of the ten exemplary and print journalists are convinced that the journalism at national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the ex-effective group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
The journalists have no problem to see where the web goes.
The biggest editorial houses are driving a pass to the Internet, imagined by many as "'l'" of the journal paper.
The "economic pressure" of journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to the hope that she "does something good" for their journalism.
Today, the largest advancement in the American journalism is among those who lead newsrooms, namely directors and reporters who work for them.
56% of national directors are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "work security".
Directors who think to lose their job in the 3-year-old space are 47% at national level.
With regard to journalists, we're going to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (on our editors, ndr) in America is still at the order of the day.
Only 13 per cent of journalists are working under contract.
In a large nation such as Usa, with 300 million residents and thousands of journalists, reviews, radio, television and Internet, employees often offer what they want, and it becomes quickly a question to take or leave.
Directors are almost always receiving large salaries, while the editor can win $10,000 per month, besides the retraite and payment of insurance.
As regards vacations, logic becomes complex: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, a number of years.
However, their revelations, American journalists, are often "malds" during the year.
This is the mistake of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOL TO GROTTAFERRATA.
The President of the second penal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the immobile agent Danilo Coppola, who had requested to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a room in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankroute in the UNipol-Bnl scale education.
During its charge, last week, he had obtained the transferred home freedom in obligatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked the immobiliar agent to park the travel of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (not granted by the pm) would allow him to influence his company and have access to evidence accused of him.
The elections are in danger.
The phenomena had already been manifested a few days ago, with the vote of the Representative Room, contrary to the 700 billion dollars safeguard plan approved by the Maison White: a great number of Americans was, and it is still more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the American economy.
And this is the New York Times yesterday confirming that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its watch → East Coast, moderated, favorable to federal institutions and business, and its new →, in contrast, conservator, enemies to "the of Washington" and the world of the finance, especially in the States of Central and South.
The vote I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, it is just a example of changes, big changes that the current economic land tremblement is already pre announced or leaves to run: not only in the United States, but in the whole of the United States, and it can be not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis is to accelerate the fenoways covered for a while, so that in the new climate they are solidified and manifested.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary renewal, the double category of the Sovereign State, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of financial institutions which, obviously, have close relationships with the foreigner, but which, above all, are involved in a large scale, the billion of people and families living in one country, in one single State.
This has immediately developed a political problem for the government: it is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also a electorate.
Soon, the crisis appears economically globally but politically, it is almost a national.
The political internationalization does not really have much to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as a habit, between the various interests and the various national strategies, cannot decide any common policy line.
And this is the Government of each State that everyone expects interventions, salvation and recovery plans, new rules, and especially a devotion of credits: when a difficult period is over, there are only States who have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to replace things.
They also have the necessary means and the ability to use them: two resources of an inestimable value, which will never be able to have any market or international organisation in the same way.
This new emphasis of the state-nation crisis is the remaining perfectly in accordance with the importance of the latest economic developments of the economy to adequately related factor: territoriality.
. Paradoxally, while we were convinced that we were now entered into the Kingdom of the Network, the more sophisticated, non-material, the conviction that globalized financing was now intended to dominate the world, we have taken account of one time, that our future should continue to regulate its accounts with little material things like water, collections, oil.
Some things that are probably transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circle space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not it, that is, he who has the evil to live in a place without recovery, without oil and without water.
I'm now coming to the second newness that, however, provides a fraction.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politic, and so Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis is produced by two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the conscience of the need for authorised leadership, the search of a person who knows to take the situation.
On the other hand, a discretion wage for existing leaders, economic species that have become inadequate and full of shadow areas.
Moreover, something deeper, in a certain sense, even inquirying: a discretion, a soffrance, an image of indequation, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the whole class of directors in a growing number of countries of O.O.A.
This increases the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of social elections until now to their appreciation, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be more stranger to the opinions of the majorities.
Soon, the request for leadership, food in subterranean, a powerful and reduced movement of delegations of leading classes and traditional political orders, which are manifested in "revolts" improvised or, in collective humor changes of these last times, from the conserving ascension in Austria Bavière, to the loss of worklists in Greece, to the rebellion of American congressists against Bush (and it may be well that the rights victory in Italy has not been reached by hazard).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parts, their programmes, but also their rites, their journals, their intellectual credits, their formats, may still have more difficulties, which are not today, to understand and thus to represent the deep beds of the western companies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and acts potentially demessed.
In view of all this, talk about the current "rebellion of mass" in order of the day, sincerely exagered.
But we're saying, keeping the eyes open, it's not without reason.
The supercolle to walk on the walls.
Vinner gravity laws through a super cold and, in the future, walking on paroes like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutions has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measured at least 2,5 square meters, the researchers succeeded to maintain a body of 100 kg on a vertical paroi.
The ETUDE- The American Scientific Review has covered some researchers from the Dayton University, Akrone, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The maternal, invented by the researchers team, is an evolution of those we know who use a special carbon structure called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the collection can be imagined as a series of tubes disposed as a spaghetti pile." Explain Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired from geckos patts, covered by microscopic poles that allow the animal to ensure a perfect adherent.
The tests made on various materials, such as the glass, the Teflon, and the glass paper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the patts of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it easily distracts from the paroi” explains Liming Dai, seeker of the Engineering University of Dayton.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? –" This maternal may be used as a temporary adhesive" Â Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the pools like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinant use such as the connection between electronic devices, since the carbon tubes are heating and electric coating drivers.
Other applications could be involved in the airport engineering.
For the instant, not super heroes.
OTHER RECHERCHE - The University of Berkeley in California also is dedicated to seeking a new adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive of microfibres such as hair, which cleans up powder during the movement on a surface to ensure a perfect and constant adherence.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Attention to the juice of pamplemousse, oral and powder.
These drinks, particularly consumed by the sea because desalterous and rich in vitamines, if associated with certain vitamin medicines, change the exhaustive or reduced absorption of cases, their efficiency, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices that they are, in bottle or fresh, associated with the injection of certain medicines; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadel, he launches a new alarm: it is sufficient for a glass of pamplemuse, oran and pomps to reduce the absorption of certain living medicines, cancels their beneficial effects and risks the health of patients.
The pamplemousse juice has already been strongly criticized because it was held responsible for the effects of some anti-arithmical, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antistaminal and neurological medicines to the toxic levels.
MEDICINAL A RISQUE- This is the Italian Medicinal Agency himself, who had given the new in a two-year information bulletin, warning the doctors and patients not to evaluate the risk of this mixture and to take care of what you drink if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadon.
WHAT PAMPLEMOUSSE - According to experts, even the oral and powder juice contains substances that inhibate medicines.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by pamplemousse and the other jus.
From there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discovered are generally, immediately reported to various national and international medical agencies that will need to change the information notes of medicines.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines we take, and, if something is not, not to be impressed, but to address the doctor or pharmacist's expert to Ansa.
The Economy's Nobel to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel price of the Economy was assigned to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a new kinesian who teaches Princeton University and is also a famous editorist of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of Bush's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the meetings of September 2001, during the days of Enron's failure, Krugman wrote in a article on New York Times that the second event would be more determining than the first, in terms of consequences on the United States history.
A prevision that caused many polymetics, which was reproached to the economy for years, but which now has been revealed exactly.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked about the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron or Worldcom's extinction disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great value economicist", but also a very aggressive divulgator, particularly critical to the excess of Bush's freedom.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the diffusion of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the next open source of personal productivity that aims to touch always and more users, from the house to the office, professionals to the administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, performed by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the great public with various news: the branch of welcome, and the interface has become less outer, other important, such as the compatibility born for the operational system Apple Mac OS X, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) ↓, the last ISO standard version.
Open Office especially focused on interaction with the Office sequence 2007, and it is actually possible to open the documents with Microsoft's new Propertyion (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
So interesting, some specific functions to some modules, such as those who allow to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentations, for example, useful to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphical processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create documents "Hybrides PDF" that join the typical graphic of the Adobe format to elements of a calculation faith or a text editor.
Many people are a element that has had various improvements within the applications: in calculation faith, different users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in texting, because each operator is assigned a color of comments for better revision phase.
Some companies are even working in order to bring certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet, and it is found on the mirror since Friday.
Further than Windows and Mac OS, the following is as a habit available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be sent at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of freedom can be a way to distribute it in the houses, it is just in the business that the Open Office next tries the big challenge, which can already count on various projects performed in the administration and schools.
Without prejudice to realities that provide training, consultation and assistance services, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could otherwise open to business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Write, for the Word-equivalent video; Calc, is the calculation fe which intends to replace Excel ; Impress, for PowerPoint Rival Presentations;Dbase, such as the glorious Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Objective for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today nearly 3 million and 600 miles are counted, it is worth that with the output of the new version, it can even exceed the estimated number.
Kohl is also positive, this is the fourth case of do.
New case of positiveness to the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best gripper's maillot.
This is the website of the day The Team reports the news.
In 26ans, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccó and ­o Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, they also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood analysis carried out on Kohl's tests is part of those performed in recent weeks, by Lausanne and Chatenay-Mala.
If the anti-analysis confirms the positiveness in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and must wait for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positiveness at the Epo of the third generation, was confirmed by the leader of the French agency antido, Pierre Bordry, who has notified the Associated Press, has notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The Austrian 26ans placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus reflecting the maillot against the best gripper.
NEW YORK TIMES WAS THE ITALIA IS RACISTE?
Italy has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for the immigrants.
Whether this would transform the Beau country into a nation of racistes? This is what the New York Times has been interested in who has dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, which is part of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originating in Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for having stolen a biscuits boat.
This is evidence of what New York Times defines as the "Northern Paradox": North regions are at the same time those where we are recorded more integration and more work," but also "a strongest anti-immigrated feeling of the country and the most important support to the North Lega"
To confirm the growing pressure between Italian and immigrants, NYT also refers to Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno involving episodes.
Not only.
Even the new islature of the Lega to free immigration and easily evacuate the emission of clandestins is quoted as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The tendance underlined by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benoit XVI in Quirinal, asked the State and the Church to work in-- to win racism."
Students of dear lowers, up to 900 euros for a room.
The location market for students was not known as a crisis
According to Sunia's latest investigation, the syndicat of localists, loving a simple room can cost to a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomena has now reached very serious aspects in the exclusion of all youth categories, the right to study due to very high global costs that the family of origin must support - explains the responsible for the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the strong request of the students has so deformed the market that a generalized discipline process has been amorized for residents.
In most cases, location offers also have a series of violations: free, uncontained contracts, without the limit of loan, subplacements.
For Sunia, exceptional interventions through the fiscal tax revision are necessary to calm prices.
In detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza, we need approximately 450 euros; for a simple room, a minimum of EUR 650 (Svart Band zone), to a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) at a maximum of EUR 900 (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, a average bed, 350/400 euros, a room of approximately 700 euros.
In Bologne, where students are in the nearest areas of the University, 250/280 euros are required for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the nearby areas of the Central University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), there are approximately 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a double bed.
Lower values (550 euros for a simple) for the nearby areas of other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
Only if it is remote in the device areas:300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the Preestina, Centocelle or Similar area.
In Naples, for a bed, 300/400 euros are required for a simple cost of 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Amminei.
In Bari, for bed, 250/350 euros must be counted, at least 350 for a simple.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the citizen economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which places are often taken by extra Community students, are recorded a later error: the request for foreign students is increased by 25/30% in comparison with the Italian application.
By the old film of Paradiso, the towns are quietly historical rooms.
History film rooms closely for the Multiplex.
"A town without cinema rooms is a village, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by Giuseppe Tornador on the scene, illustrates well what happens in the large Italian cities, but also in the provinces,
The film marginalization process, with the birth of the big multi-salers, and the consumption of mono rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that appear to us inappropriate and inappropriate; it has also all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
By disappearing, they are often historical and loaded memory places, "that is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone with whom we have shared a lot of road and so many emotions" observes the new cinema, the film offered to Tornator 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Great Price of Cannes' jury, and reported the poesience of a province room, and the nostalgia of a way to live the cinema can be lost forever.
The numbers provided by Anec, the main Property of Tradeers, mean all: The last five years, 316 films of traditional type have been closed, and these are the main town rooms that have payed the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologne and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palerme.
Among the most touched regions of closure, Emilia Romanine is headed with 82 mono films lost, followed by Toscan (44) and Lombardie (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsibility for their disappearance is the event of the multiplex, because these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-sale films: 195 scrans in Lombardie in the past five years, 81 in Toscana as Emilie-Romagne.
"Italian exploitation has developed in irrational manner" observes Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "is useful to build new structures, but it should also ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a close room in a town, these frequencies are not necessarily all available to go to multiplex.
Without speaking of the lack of credit deliberation for trademakers: the State's previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is honest that the Government does not respect existing laws from a ethnic and moral point.
To support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Let us note the case of Bologne, the first Italian city who, in concern of these closures, decided to solve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mary and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to defend and promote the mono rooms of historical and periferic centers.
Among the rules provided, there are measures for tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in mobility: spectators can enter the limited employment area and will have special tariffs for stationships and certain parkings.
"This is a initiative that I like" notes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologne in place of other measures.
However, it is evident that traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, for today's public is more needed.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a theme for me, which always was important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adultery, was the scene that convinced me to do "New Paradiso film" which I thought since 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before the Rialto, or the Quirinal de Via Naová, now closed, where I have so much shared emotions, I turn from the other side to not see the black panels by the powder.
Links between the political and the "drangheta, arrested by Gioia Tauro.
"The Major of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniformize the elections of Marie to the interests of the Piroma clan."
The directors of the Antimafia Direction of Calabre are the major and the maire of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiavione, and the maire of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external concours for mafia.
Manettes also for Gioacchino Piroma, the old mediator between the clan and the administrations, and his young avocate son, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for mafia malfactors, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"a matter against legal and legal legislation, and especially in good sense" writes to the procurors, both local administrations expressed the will of paying consultations to Master Piroma.
"In addition, it would have been granted to the clan - which writes the judges - to officially enter within the lawyers, facilitating the possibilities of, already considerable, control and orientation of the administration"
The Chairman of the Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, is only hiding "conclusions between the local committees and the organized crime, there are more than one" in its region: " there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the ́ssion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Andrangheta, the heroes that are honest."
The arrests of this morning follow the last July, after which the police announced that Piroma's clan was decaped.
Since the end of April, the Joint Council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of conditions imposed between organised criminality and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administration of the town.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Major of the UDC at the dissolution, was appointed head of a right center coalition after the ballottage of May 2006.
He cried to the scandal when prefecture ordered the dissolution of the Common Council.
He is the Minister of the Interior at the time, Marco Min日, the accusant to have managed everything for a political question, but because of the request of incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piroma's clan had even been able to ask for the change of the A3 project.
Aparting of ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, the pms write, " the ability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representative of a closer group of Piroma, which harmonises the choices of administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born of vagues, the bigs are now running.
This is a mixed driving that takes over 70% of the planet's surface and now the large world energy companies are discovering it.
Vagues, coronants, married, here are the new renewable sources on which of the colossals like Chevron have set their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands on it.
The possibility of energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, together with the first petroleum crisis, research has been intensified.
When the price of oil was deceived to 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put on the side, but now the →logistic institutions and the new increase of the oil give a big easier to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London was estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the world's election need could be covered by sea exploitation systems.
This amount would be the dual of that which produces nuclear centrals.
Moreover, there would be coronants and married.
Colosses at the attack.
The first undertaking on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a installation in North of Portugal.
When the audience was announced, it would have been said a real revolutionary step.
In two years of this, more candidates among these firms have been dedicated to traditional energy have been sent to marine energy.
"Chevron currently studys the Ocean Energy issues," she said the port-word of a company associated with the American oil coloss, the Wall Street Journal economic daily, and she evaluates the opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation concerned concerns the obtaining of a authorisation determined by the American Energy Committee, necessary to provide a draft Marine Energy Energy operation in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that just in Alaska, Usa continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set a project for new excavations.
Besides Chevron, there is Ver日 Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, who park the way of energy coming from the sea, and are invested until now, although their detail is not with, they indicate the observers, a growing interest.
Technology to set up.
Experts are talking about more at its beginning, partly the fact that marine energy does not distort the fears of the impact of →logists.
Currently, the systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Ecosse, are small, and do not create a big problem in the EEC.
In order to produce great energy, however, it must be used with higher →logistic impact.
"And the choices are different: The Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of jobs related to each other.
The powder of the waves, which makes the bottles move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of pistons and cylindres within the floorers.
The pressure makes a turbine turning around it eat a generator.
Energy is sent to the river through sea calves.
Instead, we have four systems of this type of project phase, waiting for a single federal approval and a part of energy could serve for a military installation.
See Power, rather, already produces energy for a trade center and a parking using six turbines under the East River of New York Marine.
The water movement in the sea, turning the turbines' balls, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
See; has announced to have a long list of clients waiting for the authorisations necessary to enhance energy.
At the waves, the married.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electric Energy Research, is currently deserved, the potential of marine.
Although it is a phenomena intermittent, marine is more pre-wind, sun, or vague, and so more reliable as energy source.
And this is just about the energy of the marines that states such as New York, Alaska and other, looking towards the coasts, invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and provided investments up to 35 million in 2009.
