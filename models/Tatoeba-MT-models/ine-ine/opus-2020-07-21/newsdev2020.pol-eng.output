American Congres agreed on the sale of Poland 32 F-35 aircrafts
The United States Congres for 15 days after the approval by the State Department of the possibility of purchase by Poland, 32 multi-dependent F-35, did not express opposition against this transaction, which means that the last condition was fulfilled before the budgetary negotiations of the purchase.
The Congress decision, although she was not expected, has great political importance.
"When you have approved the sale by the State Department, and now by the Congress, you don't know any of the major prejudices," said John V. Venable, the elderly adviser of the Protection Policy of Washington, conservative thinking of Heritage Foundation.
Expert explained that, based on the 1976 Federal Government, representated by the State Department, the Federal Government must deal with the Congress on the planned sale of a protection for a limit for 15 days before signing the agreement, if the value of such transaction, in the case of the sale of a protection to the NATO Member State, exceeds 50 million below.
The value of the proposed transaction of the purchase of 32 feeders F-35 by Poland is estimated by 6.5 billion below. This amount is both costs of technical and logistic assistance, assistant equipment and pilot training.
The main F-35 air supplyer – if this transaction is finally financed – will be the US armed Lockheed Martin, and his subconscient is the manufacturer of engines for the F-35A conference of Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for the purchasing of American men of the fifth generation of F-35 on behalf of the Polish authorities were placed in May the Minister of Defence Mariusz Blászak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June of the Bie Year during the meeting of President André Dudy with President Donald Trump in the White House.
After the implementation of this Agreement, if it is financed, the representatives of the Pentagon will be deceived in the framework of the Militarian External Sales Programme (FMS).
In the context of the programme FMS, Poland has already been buying an anti-racking system of Patriot.
The price of a F-35 player at the presentation of a purchase offer by Poland was – without weapons and technical assistance – 89.2 million below.
As the American military experts reported, who wanted to maintain anonymity, the price given in the early negotiations was “the maximum price of the price that will be negotiated.”
“The prices fall violently, currently the price of one F-35 is lower than 80 million below, much less than Eurofighter costs, which does not have any loans F-35”, said Venable.
The PAP speakers hoped that final negotiations on the purchasing of the United States war aircraft will be completed in this year.
Eventual share of subconscients in this transaction — whether offset — will be discussed directly with the American wheel producers F-35.

Boris Johnson addressed to the Political Supervisory Authority in connection with a close relationship with businessman Jennifer Arcuri
The independent IOPC Political Procedure Authority examines the possibility of starting against the president of the investigation to explain whether during the investigation of the public office as a Burmester of London, it has been permitted to surprise the criminal crimes.
The Council of the Great London (GLA) stated that her supervisory inspector registered the "the question related to the process" of the Prime Minister in relation to the concerns of the preferential treatment of Arcuri, which would result from the association of their closeness.
“The matter related to the process” can be said when information indicating the possibility of committing crimes is shown.”
It doesn't mean that it was proved in any way.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to test this matter.
The question was addressed to the IOPC, which is charged against members of the Policy Services in England and Walii.
It was transferred to the police supervisory authority because Johnson then made a position that was the appropriate police Commissioner and the criminal Commissioner.
Johnson refused, as if in relation to his close relationship with Arcuri, any wrongdoing.
Earlier he said that he was able to adjust London's Council and to provide details about his relations with Arcuri, but he was affected by the advice "building for an inevitable problem".
The order is the follow-up of the "The Sunday Times" report that Arcuri, the American, who has been conducted to London seven years ago, was 126 000 pounds of budgetary money, and was also enhanced access to three foreign trade missions on which the officer Johnson was at the time.
As a result of this introduction, the Government for the time of the consideration of the matter has formed an amount of 100 000 pounds to the Arcuri Hacker House company.
The Government expects serious questions on the verification procedure carried out before granting the fund.
Matt Warman in Izbie Gmin said that workers of his department "beholded the right care" and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to the numerous references to the number, they were transferred to the Office in California, where the 34-year Arcuri is now living.
The Prime Minister's report with businessman was "for the secretary of the police staff".
The GLA decision to address the Prime Minister's case to the independent IOPC Political Affairs Agency has occurred uncomfortablely at 10 Downing Street.
According to the turnover of the Range, the representative of the Government is “the political motivated attack” and its term – in the preceding of the Conservative Party – is“political manifestation”.
“The supervisory inspector has not submitted any evidence that confirms the derogations, and the president has not allowed him to answer before publishing the press communication later on Thursday”, states the Commission.
No citizens or media will be able to take such a public political statute.
Today, in the past hours, the "The Standard" journalists said that the close Johnson's business report from California, which helps the tourist and promotion agency in London, was for the workers of "Polyneal secrets".
The workers of the London & Partners (L&P) were higher established that Arcuri was a place during the foreign marketing outcomes of Johnson as a burmist, despite that her company was then not considered as "trusted".
Third assured of drug crimes related to Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – In relation to the last year's death of the raper Mac Miller, a third man was arrested and has been rejected to commit drug crimes.
According to the Court documents, Stephen Walter is assumed of the sale of oxigen oxide pigs, which Miller had before death in September, in the result of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, or a strong opioid responsible for the “epide” which had decreased several such human existences in the United States.

Walter has been arrested by the conditions for drugs from 2005 and has already been sentenced to the freedom of freedom for the violation of the conditions of freedom.
Prosecutors who are concerned about the case that the first of the web page was dedicated to the TMZ targets, ask Walter to stay in prison in expectation of a process, saying that there is a significant risk for the refuge of the defendant.
The response to the message left on the automation of his lawyer's secretary has not come once.
On 4 September, Petiti was sent to the Federal Court, and his defendant refused the comment.
The words of the Miller's rubbers are a bit of talking about his depression and use of drugs, so he gained fans from the biggest hyp-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who actually occurred Malcolm James Myers McCormick, remained in connection with the song Ariana Grande ended before 2018.
After his death in the Instagram port, she published an exciting film with Miller and the "Thank U Next", in which she reminded me of him.
Miller is one of the musics whose death has been associated in the last years with opioids.
Matthew Roberts, gita’s 3 Doors Down, died also as a result of the transmission in 2016, and in his body the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodon was stated in his body.
This article has changed: the valid name of Walter is "Stephen", not "Steven".

But the interest of Basil game grows when she was 7 years old and he was able to dedicate the time for the game.
"Every day, he played on the table as well, and he was so deceived that I was worried," said the father.
I said, "You're still playing, can't you think about playing your own games so that you can play others in it?"
When I said these words, I was deceived and I didn't think he'd take them in mind," he added.
Since that time, Basil showed a real interest in the knowledge of the creation of their own games, invited parents to buy a laptop and record it to a course where he found the bases of the game creation.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, puts his gross titles based on their contents.

Brother sentenced for the penalty for the murder of the honorable stars of the Qandeel Baloch media
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star by the published in the co-effective services, was released in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistanian media star, Qandeel Baloch, was recognized in Friday for her murder and sentenced to the invisible prison for the most proud in this patriarchal country "holy murder".
Baloch, who received glory, publishing smile himself – greek in accordance with Western standards, but in a strong mizoginic Pakistan, which was considered producers, was cast in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Wasema was arrested.
A few days later, he said during the pressure, that there was no consciousness for his actions and stated that "other" he killed his sister and that her behavior was "inacceptable".
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood reported AFP that the court in the west town Multan recognized his client as a guilty and sent him to the survival of the expected sentence.
"Inshallah (if Allah allows) will be forbidden by the judge of the instance."
Before the mother of Balocha, Anwar Mai, told the AFP that she had hoped her son would be killed.
“He's innocent.
It was my boyfriend, and that's my son," she said.
The murder of Baloch has come to the members of the world's information services and has renewed the call for action against the epidemic of honourable murders in which the victims of women are usually killed for the violation of patriarchal principles.
Women were burned, sweet, they were shot or tired for such excuses as choosing a husband or, as in case of Baloch, for bringing their family a "stream" by manifesting their own sexuality.
Mords are usually made by a close bloody.
According to the Pakistanian law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (department) can be the nearest sacrifices of forgiveness.
Three months after the murder of Baloch, the Parliament adopted a new legislation which imposed a penalty for the homicide of honor.
However, whether the murder is recognized as a honourable crime, it remains in a judge's guest, which means that the murderers may be theoretically incurred on another subject and be excluded.
In the case of Baloch, her parents first pressed their son so that in any case they would be grateful.
However, the disappointed believe that he could also lose, change his opinion and declare that they wanted his unity.
The international both of the murderers called the Pakistanian country to take an unprecedented step and to announce themselves as a faller together with the parents, providing the same movement of the case in front.
One of the most known doctrines of Baloch is to offer a strip before the Pakistanian crycket and the establishment of a decorated purple suck in Valentynka.
It was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, viewed her as a disruptive restriction in the country where the invitation to be placed in Kim Kardashian can be considered a mild and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
When the "honor" murder lies in a tribe of peaceful standards that still dominate in South Asia, and in particular standards for women's behavior, although men may also be victims.

“The Sun”: Boris Johnson in the light of the Office for a decrease of brexit requests and the achievement of a compromise agreement with Brussels
At least three weeks before the end of the EU leadership among the most important persons in the State in the area of the Prime Ministers, there are fears that he does not have enough time to obtain Great Incidences.
Boris Johnson stands before the risk of a bond from the Office to reduce demands in relation to brexit and to achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations, there was an impas on a new customs system that would constitute a substitute for the backtrace mechanism for Ireland, since Brussels set up the proposals for other definitions offered by Johnson as "incomplete".
The Ministers of Korea are expected from the EU decisions on which the German leader Angela Merkel is headed to offer you a critical toris leader of compromise in the form of a three-year period for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
The Sun journalists talked with three different office office ministers, with whom all are prepared for the conference with the Prime Minister after the morning of the tourists next week in Manchester.
They will be requested by the Prime Minister for the "agressive" strategy developed by his nearby adviser Dominika Cummingsa on the tests of the use of blef against the EU and the threat of the uncontracted abandonment of the Union and the following acceptance of the proposals which the Union has recently adopted.
One of the Ministers of the Office has decreased the prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Justice on Thursday on the end of the parliament as a "sign of warning" and added: "The only way for us to leave the European Union is to do it on the basis of the agreement.
We're never going to make the arithmetics in Eaby Gmin, which works on our unusuality.
The Premier has to go down now and accept what is able to do about.
Agressivity doesn't pay: it's real that Cummings' plan burned on the lady.
We can't run bits on so many fronts.
The second minister of the Office was committed to transfer Johnson to try to interrupt the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresy May, if it doesn't say anything else.
The Minister said: "If I have to tell the Prime Minister to present the agreement proposed by Theresa May again in Izbie Gmin."
There are numerous opportunities for its vote, and everything is very dependent on the end of this issue.
If we're forced to take the term, the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John ́or told Boris Johnson that he did not handle negotiations seriously.
In a cocktail talk, the first minister of the Tory Army said: “Premier tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
However, we don't see he sits in Brussels and works on her.
Instead, he is forced with bikes in Scotia, checks the eggs in Walii, and fights with citizens in the main streets of towns – everything in the eyes of the world, as if she had been a choice campaign for good."
The director of the present Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was remote, and added: "No one should have any charges: to make a very long way."
However, the lawyer also said that Benna's law implementing the entry into force for three months of brexit in the case of the failure of the agreement "building our negotiations" in Brussels.
He said: "The law has no doubt strengthened our negotiations, but despite it, the Prime Minister and the employees are still trying to achieve progress."
The secretary of Stephen Barclay's brexite returns to Brussels, where he will get more conversations with Michael Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss how to join the areas for the whole Ireland for food and food.

According to Lorraine Kelly, the television heads showed that because of Glassgow's accent "never will Ka'y" as a representative.
Remembering her 35-year-old chain in the television Kelly, 59, admitted that before the first exhibition on the screen, she was “very confused”.
"I was almost 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I worked at BBC Scotland in the role of research and checking information, the boss said that by my accent from Glasgow I would never have success in television.
I went to London to know the whole television team and look at the program before I took the office in Glasgow.
I will never forget the outcome with the star Bette Davis conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same place with a living legend.
I knew that I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scotland TV co-respondent in 1984, she recalled her ca'a as a local journalist in East Kibride in Scotia.
The following programs, such as "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak", started later with its morning program "Lorrain", which took a name from her name.

The pre-secrete of her long stage in the television is "pass and enthusiasm" and "interest", adding: "You need to work hard.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programs and be equally interested as well as interesting.
When she recalls the median advantages that moved her emotions, Kelly reveals that "very hard" for her was a relaxation of Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or hurt children looked at our program living from Dunblane day after a terrible murder of sixty children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting where we had been talking in her house for a lot of hours.
The meeting was quiet, and Pam Ross and I have been friends from the time of the funeral of Joanny, in which I participated.
She added that "increasingly difficult" was the outcome from Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after their Madeleine's destruction in 2007 and that "in reality he's increasing their strength and courage".
They have to advise themselves with 日 because they don't know what happened to their loved ́s, and they add the most dangerous comments on the Internet Tro.
I'm with them with the whole heart.
Larrain Kelly's 35-year-old worker program in television is spent at 8:30 on Monday, 30 September in the ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of prison
The higher range of the State officer stated that Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga had rejected the proposal to take the President's office with an unnecessary President of Robert Mugabe in the accounting point of return because he was afraid of the prison to confirm the adoption of the authority in November 2017.
The Zimbabwe Indiat, as the last week, offered Mugabe to the Vice-President Chiwende to take the president during negotiations in the context of the turnover.
However, the State officer notified in the media of competition that Chiwenga did not repeat the offers of fear, but because he had reviewed the Mugabe plan, which enabled it to use to demonstrate the world leaders and the African Union (UA) that he had actually lost during the turnover.
In view of Twitter port, who confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to submit the authority to Vice-President Chiwende, not to the President Emmerson Mnangagva, Jamwanda 2, to which the officers confirmed that he was a national officer in the Bureau of the President and the Ministers, stated that there were intensive negotiations on this matter.
The State officers claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiwenga through one of his sentences when he thought that the authority would dismiss him from his hand.
The mediation between the authorities and the dead former president had three stages, with the term of the State official.
The officer claimed that between the parties of the negotiation was a President of George Charamba, a person who then played the role of the Chief of the Central Organization of Aaron Nheper and a spiritual representative of the Roman Catholic Biskup Fidelis Mukonori.
The former bank head of Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was another element since Mugabe sent him with a single mission to submit the Chairman of Chiwendze, who was the head of the Defense of Zimbabwe (SOZ).
A man who was more than life after death as an African icon was aware of the UA's condemnation of the UK, trying to encourage other African leaders to intervention.
The Chairman's offer, from Mumgabe, from that time to the SSO Chiwende of Defense Force, did not result from the choice.
“It was a desperate work in order to save situations, which took dangerously fast time, and part of the family's wrath,” wrote the officer (Jamwanda).
But there was a little political trial that helped the dead to restore the situation in a completely non- diplomatic way.
It is important to recall that the leaders have declared that they have not distorted the constitutional order, which would be their conflict with the UA position of injuries.
The dead (Mugaba) had hoped that the SSO (Chiwenga) would then have been a severe pressure, violently interrupting the statement of leaders that they did not distort the constitutional order.
The hope for mugabe (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, at the end, was highly disoriented by the whole situation and the way to join it in its theoretical taxonomy of the inverse, would then not have a different choice, as only to describe it as a reverse, in relation to what would be reliable calling to the Swedish intervention.
Just in such a spirit, and with such calculation, this offer was done.
The officers claimed that Mugabe had done this move when he thought that defense forces had no longer been ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign the rejecting letter after the warning of the forcer that he risked the linch in the Kaddafi's campaign.
The chiefs of the United States announced him that they wouldn't return shoes against the citizens, they're moved to Blue Roof's residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two desires, whether to save his family and to prove that Eastern has taken authority," added the officer.
Current SSO and leaders read the establishment correctly.
To the Gono who transfers this desperate message was given to understand – through the potential metafore – that this wakwapa-makwapa market (we belong to a Cambodge Sect, etc.), we are not politicians or we do not competite with ourselves at political level, the State officer stated that the type of agency.
The officers of the State say that Ireland has placed the leaders in the region in the middle of the attacked people who lived in Zimbabwe that they have no intention to discharge Mugabe, but to deal with the "criminalists".
Mugabe tried to take into account the same strategy to try again to return Mangago from the short exemption in the South African Republic to be able to talk about the turnover and success.
In addition to military negotiations, Mugabe also looked for aid in the region.
The citizens of South Africa, which constitute a key element of the process, not only because of their economic and regional power but also because of the fact that the present President Jacob Zuma was the President of Sadc, rejected the intervention, but indicated that if the House of Mugabe is coming, how many times it was feared in the background, the South African Republic will immediately appear in Harare.
"It did not work because Putin and the African leaders did not choose this road," he said, "the Indiat" a certain informator.
China needs a strong leadership or a "decline" as stated by the policy document
China needs a strong, harmonised leader of the Communist Party, since another country will be "flow" – the Government has concluded in the document on the policy issued on Friday in the 70th year before the Republic of the People's Republic.
The Chinese Government's press office reported in the white box that the success of the country since 70 years ago by the Communists have been carried out to the leadership of the party.
China takes a large area, they have national conditions, rarely seems to be the administrative difficulties here.
The document reminds that without a single and strong leading force of China, they will move to the part of shares and divorce, which will be a disaster for the world.
The Chinese authorities, when developing problems from a long time, apply a strong hand policy as in the case of the prodemocratic protest translation in Peking in 1989, justifiing the need for sustaining the stability of the country.
The President Xi Jin's strong hand, which on Tuesday on the second year's trade and the world economy, has even more stressed the governments of the party and has highlighted sanctions against those who can implie the authority.
Xi also monitors the modernization programme that has lost this region from equality.
The document stated that China does not try to export their model of development or does not want to import any external models, especially in the room, not in the "hegemonia".
The Chinese don't have any other nations or domination over the world in genes.
In modern times, China was disappointed by the great powers, and the deep and anxious deeply touched them for the results of suffering; the Chinese will never cause other sufferings that they have experienced.
China is trading this anniversary in uncertain times for the country in the warm trade with the United States and faced with challenges because of the distorting economy, as well as anti-government protests in the underlying China Hong Kong.
The document says that the Chinese will never "trade" their most important interests or allow them to harm their sovereignty.
As regards the conflict of trade country with Washington in the document, “the trade dangers and the further increase of customs tariffs do not lead to the solution of problems”.
China is the overview of the economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial layer, a wide place on the market and a strong economic development time.
The document added that “wars of trade will never be weak to her”.
The Chinese are -- they are able to put the weaknesses, the crisis to replace in new occasions and open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should racionally look at China's development, because China does not intend to replace the United States or to replace the United States.
The United States can't control China, and even less likely it's that they keep China's divorce.
Limitation and weakness of other countries and transmission of national income to the border of the United States of a strong position.
Sweet Jack Pulkewich: Dubai, true face
Dubai's emirate is a place in which is seeking his own identity, separated between the beauty tradition, the islamic radicalism and the extremism of progressivity.
This designing new trends of the worldwide tourist leader develops the imagination and desires, seeking freedom of snobistic hotels and encouraging investors' fortunes and tradeers with the status of the tax paradise.
The Internet sites are enthusiasm to this city of March, which is an exciting temple of luxus and a solid concentration of the XXI century in one.
They were raised on the rich in the spring of the emirates of Eden for those who love the rest, the five star hotels, the beautiful meal and the base for hundreds of meters over the earth.
Many people are increasingly increasingly increasingly here, appreciating the creative hyperactivism and histerical steps for awgardness.
Here's the city whose moto says everything: "Speak, sniff, and stumble."
And it's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, guarding them in a city without character.
According to the British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the metropolis' full accuracy and opposition took a tangent size of the metropolis.
She was in the future cosmmar, completely designed by the "Guinessa's Records", an inofficial emirate conjunction.
Because everything here has to be greater and niceer than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is something that may be a little longer in the old Europe, but important for life quality.
In Wrocklaw, Berlin or Madrite, everyone feels like in his house.
And I'm sure it's not in Dubai.
When I fled from the dark world, I cut off his golden mask, showing the second face of the artistic paradise.
He's not talking about and not writing.
I'm showing the noise of the Asian who is contrary to the basic conditions of the divine ethnic castle of Dubai, uncles of Beduin.
I'm going to stop in the place of an incredible murder, for example to gett in the town's area, where an army of asiatic workers is building in cruel conditions.
That's exactly what they built in slave conditions in the wilderness of Manhattan.
They arrived here to the clusters and the possibility of a valuable life to their families, and they remained cosmmars.
This tourist will never see it, because it could be able to put it in the field created by the years of Mit Dubai.
More frequently, the international compatibility criticism makes the real estate of work force become highly difficult for emira.

Film material shows a strong pollution of popular tourist places
Sydney's bathroom rounded by the opper building, the Port Circular Quay, the Monday Park divorce park and mostly the Harbour Bri's higher contribution to $21.9 billion, quoted in the Australian economy by the visiting tours of Sydney.
Yet, under the mostest, the truth is a rain.
The known Sydney battery is one of the most vulnerable water roads in the country, which affects the quantity of pollution each year equal to the capacity of 15 Olympian basens.
These transparency statistics make one of our biggest tourist attitudes at the same time is one of our worst accents.
According to the new film material entitled “Zatoka Sydney – on top and down”, waters in the surrounding city are full of inflammation, plastic cats and bottles, lost bottles and parts of clothes, and even dead animals, and all of these results in the rain together with rain steel.
However, the largest part of our soul composite channels is plastic.
"I'd call this paradox," says in September 27, Dr. Katherine Dafforn, the director of the Sydney Harbour Research Programme, and the publication of this film is completely running during the World Day of Turism.
This acwen looks beautiful, but it's one of the most changed and deceived to run the river throughout our west.
The CSIRO Agency estimates that each hour 1560 kg of plastic is represented to our water roads, and its majority affects the bowl through burst channeling.
"Everything like this, it looks tragic," Dr. Dafforn said.
Two thirds of uncleanness come from rain trees.
However, as in the railway mountain, Sydney's rain problem is much more weighty under the waterful water, since 70% of the plastic that is in the ocean is on the base of the sea.
"My owner Richard Nicholls, the owner of Dive Centre Manly, noticed that he and his team are going out of water from 500 kg of plastic per year.
I think if more people knew (which is under water), they would just be over.
It's awesome... over half of what we have on the bottom is plastic networks.
The rest of 50% are things that are at least done from art creature.
When you look at the bathroom, it looks beautiful, and people can't guess that all this plastic and these remaining smiles we're getting down there.
Jeremy Brown, the co-operator and director of Ocean Protect, stated that there are ways in which people – compared to the place and tourists – could help to provide the amount of plastic and the rest of our water roads.
"It must start with," he said.
We need to fix the quantity of plastics us use, better repair materials and have a greater rate of what we leave in the steels that finally travel to the ocean.
It's destroying the ocean, waiting for us to be destroyed, because 50% of the inhaled by us are from the ocean.
He's putting up 30% of carbon dioxide and our food.
However, we can arrange this bathroom and restore it to ancient celebration, which is very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we'll kill ourselves too.
The movie material financed by the TOMRA recycling company in the framework of its series of efforts aimed at educational environmental protection and the negative impact of drinkers on the environment, which are often affected, is undertaken in the period of examining the dependency on artificial and psychological health that has been published in this month.

The test showed that the wastes of arts were also a fourth of the fear of parents, and 93% of the 551 inquired parents said that their concerns would grow with the amount of plastic wastes that were in the ocean.
Many people who participated in the study said that they wanted to do something about waste from art, but they just don't know how the significant changes resulted in environmental fear.

The Tasmanian diabetes may provide indications on the treatment of cancer
The Tasmanian diabetes may have a key to treat cancer – researchers have performed a crochet discovery that can revolve therapy for patients
The medical testers discovered how to mask the new cells
Students claimed that the same process is involved in the Tasmanian devils and people.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatment methods of oncological patients
What have the common Tasmanian and people?
Newsgroup cells that can become invisible.
Students, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a broadcast discovery that can help revolve therapy of newspapers, do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain the key to the treatment of dead guys in the face of the future threatening the threatened Tasmanian devil.
The test has determined how to mask the new cells are compared to people, as well as to the bottles, using a group of whites called PRC2, which excludes the mark that would otherwise give a signal to the opposite system to the attack on the new world.
This may constitute the greatest challenge to treat the rubnocell cancer, neurolastoma and the type of skin cancer called Merkla cell cancer.
"The significant importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immunological therapy, we can be able to restore this process," said the AAP main researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapy can be addressed to re-including marks, MHC whites, which allow immunological system to solve new cells.
"It is potentially a lot of serious implications for people with newot日," Professor Dawson said.
“It's one of the most common diseases on earth.
Or maybe we can get her much better.
Students also hope that the discovery will be used for the treatment of the tasmanian faces, where new cells in the same way avoid discovery.
"There is that it is exactly the same process (in the case of news of people and the Tasmanian demons)," said Professor Dawson.
“How hard it was to be treated by the Tasmanian devils until now.
But if human medicines can also be used in the Tasmanian diabetes, there is the possibility that this will help control disease."
Scientists surprise the fact that around the very small star, the planet is very large
Scientists surprise the discovery of the sun schedule which is 30 years of light from the Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of creating the planet, because there is a large planet like Jowis around the small star called red wheel.
Artistic illustration of the gas type planet by GJ 3512b around the central star which is a red wheel, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, the stars are much greater than even the largest planets around them.
However, as scientists stated on Thursday, in this case the star and the planet are very different.
The size of the star named GJ 3512 is 12% of the sun size, rather than the mass of the planet around it, at least half of the weight of Jowis, or the largest planet of our sunset system.
“Yes, it's absolute surprise”, said astrophics Juan Carlos Morales from the Catholic Cosmic Studie Institute at the Spanish Cosmic Studies Institute, which was held at the head of the studies published in Science.
The discovery is surprising because the theoretical models of solar systems suggest that stars with low mass of regulations become stars of smaller planets like Earth or less Neptons.
"In this case we discovered the planet of the type of gas like Jowis's round around a very small star," Morales added.
This planet, which is like Jowisz, mainly from gas, is discovered by the use of telescope in Calar Alto in Spain.
She surrounds her star after a very elliptic orbit, and the full circulation is 204 days.
Red wallets are got and have a relatively low temperature of the wheel.
GJ 3512 is not only significantly less than the sun, but it is comparable to the size of the very larger planet, because it is only about 35% greater than Jowis.
They emit less energy, so they are blueer than the sun, and their temperature is nicely low and is in a closer than 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheita / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"This is why they have a red color," said Morales.
“There are evidence of the existing second planet of the currently around this star, while the third planet could be removed from the star schedule in the pass, which could cause the elliptic orbit of the planet like Jowis,” said Morales.
The planets are part of the same international gas and skin disk that produces a star around which the planets cross.
In accordance with the model of the planet called a model of a recreation, the initial object of the parts of the continuous disk, and the gravitation force of the planet at the previous stage of development allows the atmosphere of the gas-respecting.
This untypical system can explain the competition model called the model of gravitation instability.
"In this case, the protoplanetar disk around the young star may be a little more important than we expect and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to a disease of disk stability, and thus can be more popular areas.
These masss can grow until the end of the plane falls and breaks up.

What does KAS do about Boss N°?
I refund the incompatibleness for the amount below the market price is the preservation that appears in relation to the case of the President of the Master Marina Banasia Control.
We asked about what the carb is doing in this matter in the Scarb Force in Krakova and the Ministry of Finances.
Bertold Kittel in the reporting for the "Superviser" TVN presented doubts about the owning statements of the Master President of Marian Banasia Control.
Since a few of the centuries, the Central Anticorruption Office.
The control must be completed in the second half of October, after Parliamentary elections.
As a result of the statement, Banash had to pay a stone of 400 meters in square and two less apartments.
He received 65,7 thousand gold per year.
The "Superviser" report showed that in the rock that he had made by him he had a hotel for a hour.
Boss N° later was in the national television, why he only received a little more than five of those golden meal.
“Gazeta Electoral”, calling on experts from the evaluation of the inhumanity, respected the same stone, which should be 15 of those golden.
"The quota was lower for a simple reason: I concluded the preliminary agreement and just that the winner had to buy this stone, thought I agreed to the lower factor that remained the duties divided by the sale of the rock," he convinced Banas.
However, there were doubts that such action is not a violation of law.
Conrad Zawada, the press officer of the Scarb Force in Krakowie, in the TVN24 talked that “the case is directly for the Ministry of Finances”.
"Every of this type of question, please direct to the Minister for Finance," he added.
In these cases, “the Country of the Scarbowa works”.
The Officer of the Financial Ministry of Finance admitted that the National Scarbwa self monitors many things that can be able to build some preservation.
“The Scarbowa Road works in such a way that it has its own information, as well as in a certain sense based on the information that is publicly available.
On this basis, it shall be decided whether any specific matter of eventual procedure or not," the MF's adviser.
"Instead, because we are all in all the resorts of the secretary of guard funds, we never speak, because we cannot speak in individual cases of a specific taxor, a particular person or a particular company," he stressed the question of Marian Banasia.
The Ministry of Finance Jerzy Kvitinski highlighted that “carb offices don't send to public information of this type of message”.
“We know that the whole carbon apparatus is very similar to the whole country,” he said.
The secrets of the King’s Family: shown astonishing guests often flying by the King’s Airport
In the field of service, the king’s family members in their lives have to go to hundreds of travel throughout the world.
This is usually the king's aircraft — a private machine that carries the king's family throughout the world to important events and events.
It's not surprising that having his own plane is related to the privileges.
Queen's families do not have to stand in long range to repair, do not apply their limits for the number of baggage, and, as it is shown, they can invite any guests — including really unfair.
According to the channel 5 of the documental film, not only the Queen and the Prince Philip often travel in the king's airport.
During the programme "The King's Secrets of Airports" the king's air navigator showed that and the king's family often footed guests.
Bob Shields said, "After together with our very important king's guests could fly very important king's dogs."
It doesn't surprise the fact that the Queen could invite herself to join her loving favorites in her travels, because she is known from her deep association with the dogs of the corgy race.
Since the youngest years, the Queen Elizabeth was the loving - kindness of these four - quarter sticks and heard that since the coronation, she was owner of over 30 corgies.
It is said that in 2007 she had corgi: Monty, Emma, Lineta, Willowa and Holly.
D’other cockers were sleeping: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dogs who were a corg-screen cross: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The king's aircraft was sure he had full hands of work.
The king's house's worker was seen and asked them to satisfy their needs before they were prohibited to the aircraft, says Shields.
I'm glad to tell you that it never happened to any incident.
The programme also shows an increasing number of baggage, which the Queen takes with herself on the road in the field of service.
The film Narrator stated: “In 1953, the Queen took a baggage of 12 tonnes at its road of 70,000 miles. ”
To make it better show, it's less than two big slows.
However, the Queen is not the only person who has weakness to mode.
Similarly, Cambria has its own pleasure on the transport of her garderoby – it is said that it is designed a personal seat in its cup.
The new law enters into force.
Rends in cases
On Friday, it shall enter into force regulating in the cases of a further payment of rent – informs the Financial Board.
It concerns the law of 9 July 2019 on the rights of persons injured in the case of deterioration of the guarantee sum fixed in accordance with the provisions applicable before 1 July 2006.
It relates to persons who were damaged before 1 July 2006.
They were then required to be lower than the current guarantee sums, and in cases, the insurers had already prohibited rental payments.
"I am delighted in this regulation, because we have been committed for many years to create a mechanism, which has allowed a seriously harmful guarantee of financial support in cases of the EC Communication or OC agriculture, despite the deterioration of the guarantee sum," says Aleksander Daszewski, legal adviser in the Financial Office.
In view of the Financial Deputy, it was necessary, because it is often very tragic situations regarding people in a very bad health condition that, for example, because of accidents, can not work, and at the same time costs of rehabilitation are significant.
Some of them have no longer received compensatory rents and increased needs, taking into account the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the OC policies.
It's been sometimes in the nearest years.
By 1 July 2006, the responsibility of the insurer was significantly lower than the current.
Therefore, the problem of the deterioration of the guarantee sum in the previous years was most often affected by those who have suffered damage in the 1990s.
The guarantee sums were then very low, and economic observations meaning price growth.
"We also found that this problem has also touched a number of young people who have suffered damage during the period when the amount of EUR 350 thousand was for each injured in the case.
It is currently 5,21 million euros per opinion, unless the number of damaged.
So this is a huge difference in the preceding periods, the problem was required by the legislation," it adds Aleksander Daszewski.
It explains that because the guarantee sum is at any time undertaken, the law adopted that the higher level of responsibility of the Garantie Fund will be the guarantee sum applicable at the time of addressing to the Fund for the payment of rent.
This principle shall apply to the insurance company which is not committed to payment of interest on the basis of a sentence establishing a different amount of guarantee than set out in the OC insurance agreement.
This shall take place in the case of the sum of guarantees in the judicial way in accordance with Article 3571 of the Civil Code that allows the existing commitment to be modified.
“In the last days, we sent letters to people who in the past returned to us with a request for intervention.
We are informed of new rights in them, and we are certainly able to provide further support in the event of any problems," says Alexander Daszewski.

We've got a scatepark visualization!
Finally, are you young people expected?
Elderly inhabitants disturb young driving passions on rocks and scarlets, and you are worried that there is no appropriate place for them in Olava.
Young people have been reminded of a place to drive on rolls, decorals, holes, rowers.
The theme turns back to our arms.
We've been looking at this problem since 10 years.
Recently, it's been a voice about the lack of a scatepark.
That's why we get back to it and ask the office what else?
We recall that a few days ago, a woman whose youth is in the middle of the center was rejected.
"I write in the name of the people of the Block at Mr. Pylsudski to be interested in the situation of the Olive Youth," says Malgorzat.
“The residents of the block called a lot of times to the city’s Watchtower.
For the evidence of these daily situations, I've sent to the combination."
We asked others about this matter.
The majority claims that youths simply do not have where to go in the city and have been asked for places for themselves since years.
Under the Facebook post, the comments appeared at the same time.
In July, we wrote that there's a chance to build a scatepark on the Olaw City.
Burmester informed that the city had been financed for the building of a scatepark.
“Consultated with the younger project together with the ships is ready.
On 28 March, the Department of Sports and Tourists was invited to finance the task "Budowa Skatepark in Olava" in the Framework of the Sportov Polska", we were told in the Office.
Total project value: 798 306,00
A proposed amount of finance: 263 440.00
Now we asked again what stage it is.
"We do not have any more information to disclose what the proposal to the Ministry of Sports and Tourists has been financed," informs Elzbiet Bednarczyk, head of the European Funds of the UM Olawa.
“From information obtained by Ministerial Workers, the final election of all tasks under the Polish Sport Programme should be held in October.”
We also asked for the visualisation of the Olaw scatepark.
We're taking it down.
Young people reported that the next Sabbath (28 September) will collect signatures under petition to the building of the scatepark in Olava.
"Bunting young people have seen the last post on Facebook and have come to the suggestion that they organize a collection," writes the Mikolay editor.
The signatures under petition will be collected from 12.00 in the market area of Lidl.
Puchar Polski 2019/20: breaking 1/16 final.
We know couples, hit a year ago
It was one of the most interesting rivalisations in the extraclass.
The biggest legend has increased the sword from the 1996/1997 season.
On 18 June 1997, Legia adopted an old station on the Latvian ship in the previous range.
Both of them divided the point.
Masters had to win, the second of the Polish Masters gave a point.
By 87 minutes, Legia led 2:0, but for a second minute, it came to the landscape – the vision shot three goals and enjoyed the title.

Nancy Pelosi: William Barr “wake up” and investigation in the context of the impeachment must touch his tour
It's never where we're going.
Now, I think we will share in trying to hide the facts of hiding facts, and the investigation in this matter can endure," Pelosi stated in a report for CNN on the Capitol.
"They do the work they have made, triing the facts and the time they need to find," she added.
From the protocol issued by the White House this week, Trump requested the President of Ukraine Wolodymyra Greenland to conduct an investigation on the former vice-President Joe Biden, candidate from 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked the Greenland to take this matter in Barre and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giulianim, as a result of the protocol.
Trump refused to do anything wrong.
On Thursday, the CNN concluded that the national security lawyers from the Department of Justice reported by the claim signal for the Trump to participate in Ukraine for more than a week before the formal declaration.
Following a claim in the form of a statement by the Officers of the Intelligence Community, the Department of Justice concluded that the phone calling Trumpa was not a criminal investigation on the financing of the campaign.
She asked whether Barr should be witnessed, Pelosi concluded that on Friday, the Intelligence Committee decided who to call for a witness.
However, she added that Barr's statement "build up."
That's a long time.
“Barra’s mentioned in all of this,” Pelosi added to the opinion of the Trump on its general prosecutor during the July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
It is interesting that he has made decisions on the way to consider the burden.
Pelosi noticed that “a lot of fear” of the signalists that Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that in other cases, they had been conducted with spies.
I think the President's words are too far more than the unresponsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalists play a significant role in discovering — sending out progress in our government, “Pelosi, adding the word of the Chairman on people who can provide information, highly appreciate the honesty in the government”.
On Tuesday, Pelosi has made a historical step to announce an formal investigation on acting unconformed with the law based on the refusal of pressure on the leader of the foreign country to gain political benefits.
The phone talk was included in the composite published in the quarter of the claim, in which the signalist stated that Trump had overcome his authority to “invoke Ukraine to injury” during the coming elections of 2020.
The signalist also claimed that the lawyers of Bia’s House had told the officers to make a record of a conversation from the computer system where they were kept to the needs of the Ministers' officers and to place it in the system intended to be honestly impressive.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned the structure of the Verification Committee
Kofi Manu, the Football Manager and the representative of the Secondi Hasaacas Club, reported doubts about the checking Commission for the needs of coming elections to the National Library of Nazis in Ghana (GFA).

In the report from the GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts whether the Price of the Commission will show honesty, since the result of the verification process is in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral persons outside which do not show relations with any members and who have not previously shown interest.
For example, Davies employed the NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer for 10 percent payment.
He's also known as the Olympy Player.
From these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Committee, because he is interested in it," he said.
Manu stated that it was before the Commission Fred Pappoe, Director of the Game of Olimpij, that is a conflict with the interests of the president on the basis of its relationship with the club, suggesting at the same time that if the Commission has stated Palmer, it will be the subject of preliminarity and pages before the Commission.

Israel: There is no agreement on the government of units
Two main parts of Israel, the Sojus of the Blue-By and Luke, continued negotiations on the calling of the government of the unit.
The meeting, which was held after the president's mission to establish the government of Benjamin Netanjah, did not result.
In the conversations, the possibility of both of the party's rotational conduct in the government and remaining Netanjahu was considered at the position of the Prime Minister, but, as the Hebrew journal “Haarec” says, there was no approach to views.
Conversation: Renewed on Sunday.
The Centre Sojus informed in the Communication that he presented the initial posts.
The Legal Likud defends that he was “covered in his positions”, asking that his leader and the present Prime Minister, Netanjahu, remained at the head of the government, and in the office composite, which was previously entered into its ultra-ortodoxial policy component.
“From the beginning, it was a matter that the Blue-Byale does not comply with these conditions”, the votes published by them.
For a number, acting exclusively in the interest of Netanjah, wants “to Israel to the second round of elections”.
The white-white Benny Gantz leader rejects the support of the Government that Netaniah would guide, until it is concerned about the participation in three corruptive matters, which would have been formally able to defend him after the sentence of the meeting.
“The people and the Blue-Byale have received sufficient majority in the elections of 17 September, which would allow them to be common governments as natural societies, but it forces them to negotiate which no of the parties would wish, ” wrote the EFTA Agency.
The President Reuwen Riwlin was trying to draw close to their position in the last days and invited the call for the "Rotational Government", suggesting that the Prime Minister suspends timely his responsibility, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the claims against Netanjahu were supported and formalized.
There is no Israel’s analytics who believe that the cases have been in the blind box.
However, half of the Israelites, as a result of the investigation that the results of the public television were published in the fifth, wants to dislock political situations in the country by calling the government of a unit under rotation by the leadership by Netanjah and Gantz.
This resolution refers to 50.6 per cent of Israelites, 32.1 per cent of the concerned are contrary to such a resolution.
The investigation shows the depth share in the Israelian conspiracy – on the question who should be first at the head of the office, 41.8% of the responsibles refer to Netanjah and 40% from Gantz.
In another survey published by the Journal of Israel Hajom, the percentage of unit governments increases to 63 per cent, 60 per cent is opposed to the new elections that would be third in that year.
In the pre-term elections of the parliamentary elections, on 17 September, the Sojus Gantz won 33 mandates in the 120-local Question, the Netanjah-Luc issued 32 mandates.
Netanjahu with its traditional and potential partners can count on 55 staff support while Gantz – 54.
None of the parties collected 61 mandates necessary to gain majority.
Typuric calls to fight before final player
Justin Tipuric says that “This time for checking” when Walia stands in the face of the final games in the framework of the Pucharu World, which can develop their loss in the tourney.
Wali's winning over "cangurs" would set this area in the position of Fa'ta to the winner Group D and guarantee itself to participate in a probably twivierfinal meeting with France or Argentina.
However, it is the province of Walia once 14 in the last 15 meetings, Typeuric and its circuit are blindly sent to the start with England in the eighth final.
"Let's put the case, and both of them want to try to go through this and find us at the head of the group," said the Valley rock Tipuric.
In the past, there were a little hard results, but the past season was pleasant to win them (Australia).
I think they'll try to take this victory, and we need to take it again.
Before we came here, you knew that it would be a great start.
And now we're here and it's really time to check.
Walia took only one victory over the New Zealand or RPA in the history of Pucharu Sweet – and it was placed 32 years ago in the sword on the third place when the "kangurs".
And their total record under the water of the main trainer Warren Gatland shows only seven wins in 41 trials to make three weight weight weights of the southern half-south.
Walia represented a triple of thirty lost test swords with hands in the listopade of the year, and Typeuric was prepared to be among these few saved from this winning 9-6, which would go to the stadium in Tokio on Sunday.
Typuric asked whether a wheel had experienced psychic blocks before this winning, added: “True to say.
These swords are so equipped that... maybe people hope that there will be a psychical block, I don't know.
The end of the ends in the last wall we probably put on the boss of 15 points, so the final result seems to be a very less preference than it was actually.
It's Walia triumphed, then the fight of Typurica with the favorite Australian two of the third line of Michael Hooper and David Pocock, while arresting and relief.
Typuric played 67 meetings in representation colors and met both of them in a few previous occasions, so he knows exactly what he expects.
"This is the player playing in the seventh absolute world class" said.
When it plays against the world class of the third line of the moon, it will always be a difficult sword for playing.
These two continue with the best leaders in the world.
You know what game you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is more attacking seven and probably feeling better, because it's always in the proper place at the proper time.
It's better to play against the best leaders in the world and put up challenges than to meet with the third line of the molecular, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and winning with these two, you must certainly be in a fair form.
I wouldn't say that on Sunday it's about to finish the puchar, but it's important for us in this World Pucher.
Impet is its important element.
When we build strength and continue to make great effort, we will fly as on the wheels, and it will be hard to hurt us.

They were supposed to be the elite organization of the gentlemen' races.
They accepted their series of those they kept.
Can crime connect more powerful than national identity?
In your hand, we don't give another book on the subject or military.
We give a deep international study on non-German Participation in Waffen-SS.
Historys of the European countries provide an analysis of the positions and motivations of volunteers, remember their activities and look at the recruitment process in the post-facilities.
Did Danish departments differ from French?
How did the Ukrainian enthusiasm take away?
Why couldn't you create a department from the Polish?
How does the official historical story seem to be related to cooperation in the postal countries?
What happened to volunteers after the end?
The Waffen-SS book answers among others on the basis of a solid bath material.
We had to present a higher and more closer and closer truth of cooperation in Europe during the second world, also trying to break the methodological limits of history and the period of events through the presentation of the research authorities in the countries.... The number of the main victims of the victims - the Jews, the Jews, the Jews, the Jews, the Nazi political opponents, the Slovenian people - are sometimes presented in comparative and/or the supernatural terms, so many factors are based on national perspication (if it is done).
“Total panic” when the White House fights with the finding of arguments on impeachment
The Bia’s officers in the House are shameful, thinking about how to resist the pressure renewed on the impeachment quarter, and one of the speakers with the situation describes the start of the "total panic" that was deceived last week because there was no response plan to the new reality.
It seems to be “no, uncertainty and anxiety” – one of the people related to the White House describes in this way the narrow in the west cross – that the rejected informator can seriously hurt the President and the persons from his turn.
The person said, "It is not sure that nothing is hiding there."
The Bia’s officers were still uncertain in how to act, not only because there is no major action plan in such a situation but also because they are so important that the standard methods for the effective avoidance of the controllers used by the President in the past may not work. "It does not look like something that changes together with the appearance of another message heading cycle" – this person has disappointed.
Another person who knows the progress of the discussion described the atmosphere dominant in the White House as a “shocking state” which is associated with the growing uncertainty that, together with the interviewing investigation on impeachment, it increases the probability that the Chairman will respond in an unresponsible manner and become “easy to watch”.
This fear is divided by another speaker who claims that the president's tourists will predict that he will show more "proportional" behaviour and that the pressure on him will certainly be increasing every day of the investigation on the impeachment.
This is anxious that Trump can present more unpredictable behavior and explode in unexpected manner – it is in the context of the election year fearing compared to the point of view of the presidential and elections.
By establishing the greatest risk in the Presidency, Trump moved from the attack to the defence, and again followed the strategy that he evaluated as effective during Robert Mueller's investigation on Russia.
He tried to determine his own request addressed to the Ukrainian President for aid to carry out its political investigation in order to restore attention and address it to democracy and democracy candidates and to discreet the informator as a guide for partial incentives.
But while many people in the White House are in the fight after Mueller's follow-up, something changed this time, advisers and advisers claimed.
The president, whose sign is divorced by the power, shows the press show as a concealed, declared one of the people who are in the situation.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian research, it seemed to have no desire to talk about Ukraine – they visited.
Some of the presidents believe that we can avoid damage, and part of them is the fact that the informator has no knowledge of the first hand of the phone that has been mentioned on the control phone, and after the President Trump and the Ukrainian President of the Green Woodymyre, which, according to them, understood his confidence.
And how often it is when the president is an object of attacks, this fact is alive raised by his main officers in his defence.
But one of the Republican Strategies related to the White House indicates that the results of support for the President are increasingly high, and the impeachment will not affect too much the receipt of new symptoms.
“There is not a position to focus on the Chairman's commitment in the next four months”, especially if it strengthenes its legislative programme and translates in a new cycle of messages headers.
Another speaker says that those who claimed that the impeachment would help the President did not finally understand how unpredictable his response would be.
The dead officers of Bia’s House looked for help in advisers, completing the team of reaction to impeachment.
According to the person who knows about plans, since these efforts are in the previous phase, it remains unexpected whether any initiative in the centre of control will be taken and what form it can be brought.
This person stated that it was convinced that a legal and communication strategy is needed to be coordinated with a leader who is able to attack the PR against the publication of a coming signal report and aimed at enhancing the democracy action on the impeachment given by the opening of this report.
The speaker with the situation states that the non-terminal vision of the strategy was visible when the secretary of the state of Mike Pompeo and the secretary of the guard Steve Mnuchin claimed that they would not intend to publish the notes descriting the talk of Trumpa with the Ukrainian President, and the next 48 hours later it was possible to discover that there was no outcome and that the document should be published.
It is expected that the pressure will now be greater than during Robert Mueller's investigation, who has kept silence and spoken only in the middle of an offense. One of the people who can be involved in developing the response to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the brutal work of Trumpa and were a choice staff, declared the person related to the matter.
However, Lewandowski said in conversation with NBC News that it is not the true suggestion that he will guide this action.
"In the past years, I did everything I could to support the President and his program – said – but I did not participate in any conversation with the President or his team on the combination of the team in order to support the false story of impeachment."
Private Advocate Donald Trump from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in the action on impeachment.
“We respond to the matters as appropriate” Sekulow answered when NBC News was asked for a comment.
Currently, the White House discovers the lack of a lawyer experienced in the area of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked at Clinton's impeachment and consulted the White House at the end of Mueller's researcher, went away, and the current adviser, Pat Cipolone, has no such experience.
The speaker with Bia’s strategy stated that generally officers were not planning to engage people at any time or to create a leading center, but admitted that the need for coordinated, common reaction and political fighting was needed.
The refugee Explorer of the Seas line Royal Caribbean passed the replacement for 89 million pounds
Explorer of the Seas, along with the Royal Caribbean International family, expires this year in a journey, presenting a completely new view.
After renewals, which have impressive 110 million dollars (89 million pounds), the ship takes a wide choice of culinary dreams from the world and the rich offer of divorce for the whole family.
This year Explorer will be held in the most expensive ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to start the Middle East Europe.
When the ship ends, the ship vessel promises unforgetted in the sea.
By providing an offer of co-operating everyone, Explorer, after renewal of $110 million, or $89 million, moved to a passenger ship whose perfect divorce for the whole family.
The impressing means that passengers can surf on the ground through the advanced surfing simulators or see the favorite family movie using the wounds in the plenary cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the delivery of virtual balcones that allow the internal cabin passengers to highlight seeing on the ocean without the need of origin.
Water lovers are designed for a new place on the basis of the Caribbean Kurtor with the water park.
Basen records the strange hazards and parts ideal to go out in the sun, and two modernised eatly are in the hand of people who are insulted with powerful impressions on the ground.
The fugitive attraction for passengers each age impose the number of activity for guests during the journey to target places.
A little Adventure Ocean for children is a chance for young family members for beautiful memories, and an exclusive place for free time for youths offers super games and music areas prepared with the thinking of persons of the 12th year of life.
If this appears inappropriate, the whole family may be in the "B study" on the ship to meet the laser tag player with the effect of lighting in the darkness, which can also be imponerable as a railway for the driving on the beds.
During the traveling to the Mediterranean Sea, they will also have the opportunity to learn exotic shakes from the world, attacking the restaurants on the ground.
The modern Asian kitchen is offered on a ship in the Isumi restaurant, and in the freshly open Giovanni's Italian Kitchen, it is a mixed food inspired with a newer connection to a traditional Italian kitchen.
To the rest of the gastronomy points on the border, the American restaurant is calculated by Chops Grille, Latin Boleros bar, Schooner Bar and Johnny Rockets bar.
Rejs, with the option of seven or nine-day road, runs from Rim in May 2020.
Like the second, the ship is on the Royal Caribbean line to Allure of the Seas, which also did not pass a unbelievable replacement.
After the 58-day Allure metamorphosis, in the amount of a gigantic $165 million, the travel operator offered the guests who had previously made reservation, a wunderer of $300 to deliver on the board.
“Explorer of the Seas is the fourth ship of Voyager class, which will transite into the modernization of the Royal Amplified float line.”
The programme that requires investment more than 1 billion dollars, which includes 10 ships and continues four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and provides a wide range of possibilities: from unrecurrent attractions and gastronomics at night life.
Devin Nunes defends the Democrats that they ask for Trumpa's footsteps
The Congressmen Devin Nunes from California state does not seem to be aware of the fact that the President Donald Trump is investigated.
In his quarter defense, the President forbid the Democrats that they wanted the president's noise.
Nues, a highly presented Republican, sitting in the Committee on the Exemption of the Repre­sentants, put a derogation during the interim statement during the consultation of signalism charges, as if Trump returned to Ukraine to help in the beginning of the investigation against the Democracy candidate to President Joe Biden and his son.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal for the "grotetic representation" of the left and their "medical asem" before he concluded that the Democrats wanted to see the president in the neighborhood.
"The Democrats in this exact committee negotiated with people who believed that they were Ukrainians to talk about Trumpa's nage," said Nunes.
“The people can ask right why the Democrats are so determined to put the President in the state of prosecution when they will have their opportunity for a year.
When Nues finished giving reliefs, the political reporter HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, started to check if the Democrats really try to discover it.
To this time he answered only the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, although we doubt that his answer is our truth, confirming the thinking of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Portal Mediaite.com submits that Nunes' comments on naughty were related to “certain more favorable and uncertain information” which probably appear in Steele's acts,
It is celebrated, gathered by Christopher Steele's former British Spain, a collection of strips against Trump, showing the probability of the existence of the ships, which shows him in the night, watching the power of prostitution in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potencial biocarbon studies can help to renew
In the past years, when electrical cars and Semi Tesli have arranged for information services, one looks like to avoid renewable energy – aircraft.
However, Professor of the University of Alberta developed a → which caused renewable biocarbons to be exploited as a aircraft.
Dr. David Bressler is professor at Albert's University for agricultural skills, education on life and environment, which has worked on this project in 2003.
His eyeium produces carbon fuel obtained from fat waste, such as vegetables from restaurant, fat origin of animals and repacks.
In contrast to ethanol and other biocarbons, this can be used during the production of less quality, thus respectfully 85% of the carbon below in the case of oil fuel, and in the process of waste originating in other vegetables.
This technology is intended to imitate carbonwaters present in oil fuel.
"What we have done in the first generation," said Bressler, "is [in the sum of creation] carbon weapon, which are the same parts as the diesel fuel."
During the opening of this new possibility of use of biocarbon, previously developed biocarbon products signed the trend to destabilise at lower temperatures, which was a significant threat in the case of aircrafts at large heights.
"The problem with the airport is a little bug round," Bressler stated.
It's really less worth than diesel, but it's got a requirement.
Bressler's Laboratorium is currently viewed by two options for the production of aircraft.
The first option is a small approach to the risk that requires the processing of carbon fuel and the addiction of water.
The second option is to continue working on chemical properties that are partly developed, even in temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," said Bressler, commenting on another option.
This option is more risky.
The pressing company held by the Alberty University, Forge Hydrocarbons, works on the combination of the product, since airlines, as well as the Canadian and the American Army, increased investments in a renewable option.
“They are able to imagine the times in which the replacement of the situation may occur and will be on them for carbon taxes” said.

Prime Ministers of Boris Johnson warn that when the British brexit refuses, they threaten ZAMIESK as in Los Angeles, and he himself calls on s.
One of the main ministers of the Office said yesterday night that the country would have a "fortunate coherence" if the original result would be questioned by the result of the second referendum.
Premiers of the British Prime Ministers from his neighborhood warned that the country threatened peaceful concerns to the "Gulden Chambers" protests in France because of the inequality and residence in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called to “rejoice” during the bullet on the political language, but stressed that it would not stop the use of the word "submission".
Despite his invitation to the Minister of the Office, “The Times” said, “In this country there have never been protests such as “gilets jaunes” (“Gulden Chambers”) or residences in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – gilets jaunes – using encrypted phones that can coordinate the pickets, and to bring people to protest, there are enough popular leaders.
The inhabitants in Los Angeles were exploded after the lavage of the white police murdered four white police who killed Rodney King's black taxi officer in 1992.

"If we organize a referendum in which 30 million people vote, 66 per cent of them will be represented for the remaining of the United Kingdom in the European Union, the rest of nine million citizens will be uncomfortable," said the Minister.
Even if this result ignores 99% of them, then we will have 100 000 angry people who will write to their poster and who will not forgive.
Many don't need to see back in the street a few ten thousand people.
One of the main ministers of the Office added that the country’s “fortunate grip” would be questioned if the result of the first referendum would be questioned by the result of the second.

Government is law instead of law governments.
“In spite of the lack of sufficient number of votes to amend Congo, the majority has made a number of changes in the State system by providing dangers for the protection of law and the rules of the rules of the government,” it is written in the fourth report of Helsinki's Human Rights Fund.
The report “The Government is law instead of law governments” documents, inter alia, amendments to the dimension of justice and to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Human Rights Fund (HFPC) published in the fourth report entitled “The Government of the Rights instead of the Governments of the law.
Human rights protection threats in Poland in the years 2015-2019."
The Fund assesses in the report that in 2015-2019 the largest return on human rights protection in Poland after 1989 was reported.
“In spite of the lack of sufficient number of votes to change the Congo, the majority has made a number of changes in the State system by providing dangers for the protection of the law and the rules of the rules of the government.
By adjusting the law to political objectives, the rules of law were replaced by laws," says HFPC experts.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents amendments to join the dimension of justice, independence and responsibility (e.g. public media or Government of the People's Rights) and in the field of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including the freedom of meetings, women's rights, the rights of persons in LGBT and the rights of the rights of the rights of the rights of the rights of the people).
The report also summarizes a period of three years after the Poland authorities and the European Union.
“In the last four years, we had the right to use partial interests at the first time and at this scale.
This was made to the continuing law crisis and to weakness of the human rights protection system in Poland," a lawyer of Marcin Freeny, one of the authors of the report.
Human Rights Protection
As stated in the report, the last four years are “system change periods in the country” and “the protection of human rights”.
In the last four years, Sejam adopted more than 20 key legal acts from the view of human rights protection.
“The changes were often adopted in a quick time, without peaceful consultation, and despite the preservation of the legal environment, the Deputy of the People's Rights or international organizations”, lawyer Malgorzat Szuleka, co-rapport.
According to the report, the main trends carried out in the last four years are: “the weakness of independent ini (including courts and procurements), the non-respecting of the binding courts and international recommendations and the weakness of human rights”.
State bodies did not respond
The Helsinki Affairs Fund recognised “the situations in which States authorities did not respond or directly treated the agressions.”
The funding experts found that some changes were introduced in the atmosphere of postal attacks or groups of foreign groups or discrimination.
The Fund indicates that the result of State activity in the field of restriction of law is a continuous support for the field of authorities with the European Union and a number of recommendations from international law entities.
The report states: "The lack of the implementation of these recommendations is not only weakening the position of Poland as a democratic leader in the Middle-East Europe, but also on the Polish State on the responsibilities for the violation of the law of the European Union or of the European Convention of the Human Rights," says the report.
Brother of Pakistan's stars of compatibility mediums with food for the homicide of honour
Experts of women's rights claim that the investigation of justice is often difficult because of continuing processing, the release of suspicious killers for the purchase and the disturbance of public opinions.
“This is the way that people forget”, says Farzana Bari, the defense of women's rights and the first employer in Pakistan, and adds that even a widely announced case of Baloch's murder has been dissolved for more than three years.
Although, according to groups of fighting women's rights, data are difficult to be established, the Pacific Committee on Human Rights in 2018 concluded at least 300% of the honoral murders.
Many actors say that the real number is significantly ≥a, and the network that promotes crimes from honourable motives is estimated that Pakistan is reached to one fifth of the 5000 honoured murders every year throughout the world.
Records of Poland outside the border
However, translations to the small country, because many emigrants have a seat outside the Poland on stage – gives the fifth "Czechpopolita".
The newest report of the Euro-Tax report shows that the average debt of the Poland working in other European countries have increased in 2018 more than 8,6 thousand evil, which means that they have increased nearly thousand gold, or nearly 12 per cent.
Euro-Tax “speaks that the total income income of economic immigrants in the Union countries reached the record value of 154,5 billion evil in 2018, one more than seven years ago,” we read.
The Director of the Mediterranean Studies on the Warszaw University, Paul Kaczmarčik says that the Polands are better in the international work market, where various options are available.
"In addition, the number of specialists and fachops, who are moved from country to country, as well as international corporation workers," reports the magazine.
A number of Euro-Tax clients works in two countries, such as the United Kingdom and Germany.
“It is in the RFN most in 2018, since about 11 per cent increased joint emigrants (approximately 27 billion ills).
However, most of the Polands have seized – almost 35 billion ills”, we read further.
The Euro-Tax price believes that, despite the improvement of the labour conditions on the Poland market, the number of employees is not small.
Because the Saxon on Western and North of Europe (for example with Norway) is often a chance for a few-quarters of money than in Poland.
“And this is even in the minimum rates in the country, for example in Germany, EUR 9,5 to 11,7 per hour,” reports the journal.
The "Reschopospolita" suggests that the Poland is not only due to the profits, but also because they have been deceived outside the border.
Many Polands leave outside the border, as you also see after small transfers of money to the country.
These last years were less than years.
As the economy Tadeus Christicki recalls, together with you, a small group of people who transfer money to the country and their height.
"Because the immigrants are getting close to themselves," we read in the Friday "Rezpopolitey".
For long-term monsons, there are races and chaos in many Indian regions
The monsone season in India is almost a month, and the unusual rainfalls cause death to cause building and soiling many fruits.
In the northern Indian monsun is at the beginning of September, however, the average rain invasions exceeded by 37% in this month.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation will continue in the next few days, it will be the latest end of the monsun since decades.
In many areas of the rainwaterland, there are unexpected pressure – lastly in the west of India, the Medical and Fourth town of the town of the Middle Pounds have caused a number of people to die and to destroy buildings.
It came to the house room, people dropped through the streets in the water on the horn, which normally is located only during the monsun apogeum.
Great rainwater also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of enduring rain in the north state of Uttarakhand, many houses were destroyed.
Monsun also started with late.
In many areas, there was no water, so farmers were prepared for a probably sugar.
Too long monsun is not a pleasure to be seen by farmers.
That amount of rain isn't normal about this time of the year.
"My warehouse is through him, and now I have a capputh, a fashion, a gross, and a mumour," says Prakash Meera, a farmer of the economy in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.
For consumers the lost impact and the late end of the monsone, it means a subduction in the price of the cebul, or an unusual ingredient of Indian foods.
The cebul, for which it had to pay 20 rupies (0.23 pounds of British), costs 80 rupies (approximately 1 pounds of British) for kilograms in cities such as Delhi and Bombaj.
They are also threatened by festivals and holidays.
The next big festival is the attendance of the 8th October Festival of Dasar, wherehinds lift up large cocktails like the comic, representing Ravana, to put on a big whisper and a bad smile from the epoch "Ramajan".
Ravany's fire symbolizes the triumf of good over evil.
However, taking into account that the similar Ravany has been made out of the paper, if the monsun will continue, Ravana will just laugh last.

Doodle celebrates 21 birthdays of Google
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google.
We're looking for answers to all the questions we're wondering.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is this?", "Where?", "How?" and "Ile?" is one of the favorite categories searched by the Polands.
The gigant data show that in the past year we wanted to ask for this "Where is the Bursa?", "How to do Sparge?" and "Only the fingers have horses?", "How to lose the museum of fruit?", "How to eat cooks?"
Today, the search market is about twenty-first birthdays.
Her owners – and in Poland up to 96 percent of people use the "Google's once" – welcome the special Google Doodle.
It's not animated this time.
Google reminds his birthdays, showing a stationary computer with the monitor, mouse and keyboard, and at the right, bottom, the digital date was printed – as at the 90s.
Information Directory
The search market was a specific purpose – she had to register all possible information and to provide them via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term of googol that means the number of ten to the center.
This name was also to refresh the purposes of the company to identify as the largest number of parties from the world resources of the Internet.
The Google Surveillance has been formed by Sergey Brina and Larry Page in 1996 in the framework of their student project at the Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of dependency on pages, which worked better than the methods of recording results based on the frequency of the expression.
At the start of the search, the name was BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linked to that result.
Page and Brin installed a company under Google Inc. on 7 September 1998, and soon later they broke up the google.com page.
What else, Google?
In December 1998, the ‘PC Magazine’ reports about the greater travelability of Google's search results.
Then the story of the company looks almost like a bajke - a bleeding growth with each month, a combination of other markets and an increase in the value of the company.
In June 2000, Google's URL index has more than billion locations, which makes the Page's and Brina's work gets the largest web search in the world.
Currently, the company for the Page's and Brina is one of the target players on the IT market.
So there's another development field?
"Google's mission is a worldwide organization of information resources to be generally available and ecologically, although we have made great progress in this area, it is still a long way before us to achieve this goal," he was talking to "Newsweek" Peter Zalewski from Google Poland.
Common contact with pesticides can increase the risk of occurrence of heart diseases and breeding
The new trial suggests that work with the contact with the plant protection centres in large areas can be translated to a high risk of heart accuracy in later years of life.
This was the case of a group of Japanese origin in Hawaii, who were studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists determined that in comparison with men who did not work with plant protection centres, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more to heart disease or throat.
“The need to use personal protection equipment for the time of contact with pesticides in the work and the importance of evidence in the media documentation of contact with such funds in the work, as well as the control of standard factors increasing heart diseases” said the study of Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She's a professor of geriatry medical at the Hawaii University in Manoah's district.
Repositories based on data on more than 6000 men on the Oahu Island, who participated in the kardiological program of Kuakini Honolulu.
As scientists, the results of the studies may not be applied to women and other populations, because it was only men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long period of semi-time disorder, so the effects of their health effects can give a lot of years after contacting them.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection.
In the press communication, Rodriguez stated: “The relationship between pesticides and heart diseases and injuries has not been significant since 34 years of age. ”
It was so probably because the factors were more important to be related to stage, which masked possible relationships in the past years of life on contact with pesticides and injury diseases.
The testers did not discover a significant relationship between exposure to small to measured levels of plant protection and increased risk of heart diseases or pain.
Telephone Chat Greenski-Trump: Birthday to its three terribles
The Vasington policy has a worst week in connection with the start of the impeachment procedure against the US President Donald Trump
Increasing in political scandal, this is for the political debitant Wolodymyra's Green situation that he would like to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump affair and will she have a lot of serious effects for the first of them?
Almost at the front of the telephone, Trump declared to Zelenski that the United States do more for Ukraine than countries.
Despite the fact that the White House notes are not full, they specifically describe Trumpa's attack on the German Angela Merkel cancer because German leaders together with other leaders of the countries are engaged in negotiations instead of presenting specific proposals.
The counterparty raised the Zelenish response, which announced that it agreed with Trump not to 100%, but to 1000%.
Greenski added that the French President Macron and Merkel are trying to help Ukraine in the same way.
This exchange of views made the politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, have been able to vote through intermediate cohesion services.
Petro Poroszenko, president of Ukraine, stated on Twitter that the support provided by the EU was "without pre-dependence".
In other Twitters, the Portuguese said that it was thankful for granted under the "Russian aggression" support of the EU, which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their fears, such as the Ukrainian Policy Victoria Voytsitska, said: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?"
Thus, Trump mentioned the Spanish aid and requested the Greenland for a follow-up not in one and two cases: the first of Joego Biden – Hunter – and the second related to interrupting the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the hacker attack on the mailboxes of the Democrats during elections in 2016.
It doesn't matter whether it describes relations, or makes a devastated relationship with the leader of France and Germany.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank everyone who gives us aid" – he declared after publishing a telephone record in New York during the United Nations Collection.
Greenski has to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France in the nearby "four of the standards", which is to take place in October.
Ancient inspector's legally eligible leadership
The Judge of the Wissus Jere of his deeds.
After 6 years, Jerzy Wisnewski was finally excited from the destructions.
The Court of Agricultural Court in the Industrie has made the Wisnew Jere, the former Chief of the Governing Board of Commercial Quality Articles in Russia, with a derogation of the exemption of the rights.
The Libbles procurement for him was to deliver to that timely marine, the control term in the food production facility.
In this case, the lawful sentence of the offender has not been abolised.
The appointment was divorced on 12 September.
“The Court has understood the injury sentence”, confirms Judge Malgorzat Rezer, the Officer of the Circuit Court in the Industrie.
This is the sentence of 14 February, issued by the Court of Justice in the Industrie.
Jerzy Wisnewski then commented on Facebook: “It was six years ago since I had been presented by the Appelacial Procurature in Lublina to reject the stated disruption of law in conversation with Marshall Woewowa Subkarpacki on 30 April 2012.
The Court claimed that I was innocent and that I did not violate the law of the law.
I was convinced that my phone conversation with Marshall Woewowa Podkarpacki was in accordance with the law applicable.
The version of the events that have been published in 2013 by the Appelacy Procurature in Lublina is with the truth and the consequence of unreverse damage is compared to the preliminary food producer and I will also lose my view of my person in my employees, among the employees and in local cohesion.
The Court's opinion contained a number of errors, uncertain facts, irrevocable legal bases, which were not confirmed in reality.
With the CBA in Russia, everything was done to eliminate me from public and foreign life.
I was immediately released from work and lost financial measures.
I left a long time to keep my husband."
Let's remember.
In the years 2009-2013, the Vice-Westlands has fulfilled the leader inspector of the trade in the agricultural and food articles.
He was revoked from the position after the procurement in Lublina in 2013.
In the case of researchers, he had in conversation with the phones to deliver to that period the Marshall leaderwa (Miroslav Karapyta was sentenced for four years of freedom) the time of control in the food plant produced by the current sub-packed submarine.
This warning, as Lublin prosecutors claimed, was supposed to conclude that the owner of the company knew the control and corrected the labels on the ships that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisnewski had been denied for the extent of the rights, which had been for him until 3 years of freedom.
"I feel the obvious that this matter has finally reached the end and that the court has confirmed my innocentity.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I did not do anything of what now the final confirmation is a legitimate judgment that prevents me from my delays," comments Jerzy Wisnewski.
White House tried to hide a record of conversation with Greenland
In the fourth of the signalist report, the President Donald Trump, speaking with the President of Ukraine the Green Wolodymyr, requested an inheritance of a foreign country in the elections in the United States, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and United States
In an anonymous report dated on August 12, which is probably an output worker, he said: “In the framework of my services, I was informed by many members of the Government of the United States that the president had encouraged his responsibility to ask for the inherence of the country in the election in 2020.”
“Trump used part of the talk (with Greenish) to perform its own interests.
And exactly – he was trying to press the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the President in the reelection in 2020, and vote in the report quoted by the journal The Hill.
The Ukrainian leader was "intelligent" that contacts with Trump depended on whether "the will of play" in cases that the President Rudy Giuliani had to inform him.
The author admits that he was not a testimony, but it underlined that he was specifically informed of its content by “a large bia · home officials who had direct information on this matter” and their reports were covered.
“In the following days after this conversation, I have learned from many American officers that the high-range representatives of Bia · Home have intervened in order to "invoke" all possible records on this conversation and, in particular, the literal record that was designed, as usually, in the White House crisis room, we read further.
“The High Randy of Bia · Home told me that the lawyers of Bia≤ House “invited them” to make a electronic record from the informal system where such records are stored.
The record has been transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually entitled to store information fairly confidential and manipulating them," said the report author.
"In my evaluation these steps prove that Bia · Home officers have dealt with the importance of what happened during the conversation," the signalist assessed.
As the AP agency comments, this document probably accelerates the procedure on the possibility of the President's impeachment and also contains valuable information on witnesses that can confirm this report.
A talk record with the Green White House, after the pressures of the Congress, was available in the middle, but not on the basis of electronic records, but on the basis of the relationships of people who were witnesses.
The content of the report, in the edited version, has been published by the Committee on the Exemption of Repreitens later.
Moreover, in the fourth fulfilling of the Director of the American Exemption, Joseph Maguire witnessed before the Committee on the Exemption of Repreitens and explained how he treated the report of the employee.
Maguire said that the signalist did the right choice and did as he commanded the law.
He also highlighted that his view of talking with the Greenski is the issue of “without precedence”.
The Democracy in the outcome committee asked Maguire why he blocked the presentation of the Signalist report to the Congress; the Director of Department replied that he had no right to determine its content, which is the confidential nature of guaranteeing the privilege of the Executive Authority.
A part of Maguire's consultation by the Commission has been closed by the doors.
On Thursday, the Officer of Nancy Pelosi reported that, in the context of the summary, the president had put pressure on the authorities of Ukraine to harm its potential fishwall in the next presidential elections, the chairman's elections, the chairman's elections, the chairman's chairman's investigation, which could lead to Trumpa's impeachment.
On the next day, she assessed that the entry of the Trump talk with the Greenland confirmed that the President of the United States had violated the election and security standards.
The EU's electoral law to prohibit use of foreign countries' assistance.
The Resort of Justice, however, assessed that the President did not violate the electoral law. On Thursday, the Court of Auditor Bia · Stephanie Grisham said that there was no "only inequality" in the conversation, and in the report “there is nothing more than a collection of relations from the third hand and along the pressing points".
"The White House will still criticize this story of media and the false story propagated by the main nutrition media," she added.
Ghana gets two ICAO recompenses
Ghana has received two pressure rewards during the 40th meeting of the International Civil Airport Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.

Exhibition of the missing suck of Elzbita I in Hampton Court palace
Transpaid by silver, none of the most famous camel was made from the most famous camel, articulated by the hedge representing vegetables, animals and motyls.
For Eleri Lynn, the historic Royal Palaces Foundation curator, it was only one thing.
It was white for 100 years to the wall of the parafial church, which she looked at, could only be a devastated part of Elzbeth I garden.
Three years after Lynn reached an exciting altar tube in Bacton in the Herfordshire garden, the lost tissue of Elzbeth will take it for the next month to the exhibition in Hampton Court, near the same places in which the Queen of Tudor's Dinastia could have taken it over 450 years ago.
The meaning of this discovery is that the whole collection of the king's suck was only one of the other elements of the XVI.
Although there is no unexpected evidence that Elzbiet ever carries this sugar, three years of research strengthened experts to convince that it must be part of the king's garden.
“Structure”, an extraordinary road of trees, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the king's dèw, and the virtuous quality of the trees and kitchens, which later were riches of yellow, dogs, motyls, fishermen and narrows, indicates that the killer belonged to the most characteristic of the persons.
Suknia, when she was hidden, could cost the equivalent position of Tudors.
"In addition, in the 1990s, or at the end of Elizabeth's rule, it felt the danger of other women on the ground and would not tolerate the fishing weakening such outputs," says Lynn.
“As it's a very important statement, I asked many people from the environment to look at the sucks.
I really enjoyed that when I saw the wheat, they were also inquired of it and were practically convinced that we had an element of the king's garden before us.
The long, renewable life is not as unexpected as it could seem to be as an altar tree in the dark church of St. Faith in Bacton.
Bacton is a place from which Blanche Parry came, the nearest Elzbieta lady d'a, who served the Queen through her long life and with which in local legends a designed tissue was made.
Despite her death in 1590, experts believe that Elzbieta has to give her the family Parry or parafia to Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservatory work, four of which were on the most delicate handshake using specially colored cheese and cheap chirurgical games, the altar tree is at the exhibition at the time used by the Hatfield House portrait "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most discreet images presenting Elzbieta in a similar wheel.
"Before working with historical teams, it is really to be honoured by the artists of people who have done them," says Libby Thompson, the main conservatory work, whose most of them have been processed in this purpose in the Hampton Court Palace, the only large place to place some of the unworthy wallets.
"When I looked at the leader from front and back, I began to consider a great respect for those who did it.
I never worked on something so elite.
The Lost Dress of Elizabeth is reported on 12 October in the Hampton Court Palace

Rating agencies are to help investors to evaluate the risk of their investment action.
Rating is granted to companies, banks and States.
In the case of these last, the assessment is translated to economic attractiveness.
The Rating is nothing else than a credit credit credit assessment.
On its basis, it shall be decided about the person and the amount of money.

With the Department of Justice, the cartridge changed "tone" of cocaine, metamphetamine and heroin of unclean phentanyl.
The El Mencho head waits for a recompense of $10 million.

“It's always nice to play a goal, and I've still found in that moment that we can continue to play in the puckers (Moses's fixed at 3:3 in the 119th minute - red).
Dad often dressed me and laughed that I couldn't cut the doors, and I always told him that I would shoot at that moment when he wouldn't wait."
Now the Moscow counts back to the basic container, the more that because of the cards, it can't play O'h Tarasenko.
"This is why I'm able to be trained to play in the first composite," says Mosakovski.
“In Cross, I did everything to deal with the best.
But if I'm playing, or I'm sitting on the reservation boxes, I'm going to be the same very strong team.
Because the most important is the race and three points in the match with the Subbeskid.

Such Internet could offer opportunities for security, discovery and accuracy to maintain time not available in the traditional approach to the establishment of a network.
The Centre for the Promotional Quote Transfer of War Laboratorium for the Development of the American Army Walk Wake was looked at researchers from the University of Insbruck, which could achieve a record transfer of the state of the material and light – to 50 km away with the use of the worldwide cattle.
Smoking is a corelation, which can be used by quantities such as cubics.
When two cubits are cut and the measurement of one of them, this will affect the measurement made on the other, even the second cubit is physically remote.
"These [50 km] are two rows of size further than it was possible before and it is a remote distance to the building of interlocutors of quota networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, the experimental physician from the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project, which was published in the Nature magazine, section Quantum Information.
Intermediate quantity networks would be consistent of remote nodes of physical cubits, which are assembled with themselves despite the large distance of physics.
The investigators claimed that this exhaustion of the state is necessary for the use of the quota internet.
“This demonstration is a strict step towards the achievement of a simplified state of a large scale”, said Dr. Sara日le, co-administring the program for this research.
The quality of the state at the second end is also too high to satisfy some of the most difficult applications of the quantity network.
The bacterial team was experiencing the experiment from the atom of the wave captured in the john puzzle.
With the leser links, they entered a quantity status in jon, simultaneously encouraging it to emitte the photon in which the quantity information was recorded.
In the result, the quantity of the atom and the parts of the light have been calculated.
The challenge is to send a photography with a light chamber.
"Foton emissed by jon wapnia has 854 nanometers and is quickly embraced by lightwater," said Lanyon.
Thus, his team first sent a part of the light through the inline cristal highlighted by the powerful transformation of laser.
The length of the football was transferred to the optimal value from the view of the sending point to large distance – the current standard telecommunication rate is 1550 nanometers.
The following researchers sent this photo through a 50-km-cabel light.
Their measurements show that the atoms and parts of the light were drawn in the next row even after the crossing of the wheel and overcoming this distance.
“The decision on the choice of the weapons means that this result is a direct path for the use of atomic clock networks on large physical distances, since the weapons can be associated with the high quality of the ‘horizon’ cubit.
The army is very interested in the large-scale-build record networks because of the application of the precise setting of positions, accurate navigation and time synchronization," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a researcher, who also supports the programme.
