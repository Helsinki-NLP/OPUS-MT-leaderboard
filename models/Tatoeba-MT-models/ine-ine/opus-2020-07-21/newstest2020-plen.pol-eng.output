Father Joseph Witco: I saw Jesus in the white rock
He's a charism.
To him, the sanctuary of freedom and healing brings the crowds.
He was a couple of years when his life began to happen increasingly.
Today, in the middle of the French, others experience that.
For the o. Sweeps of freedom and healing, the crowds are throwing
Sometimes the parents of a 7-meaning child who had a width of 7,5 mm in the heart.
It was supposed to be operated.
Joseph’s father Witko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy went to the hospital for a trip.
The medical surprises said: “Operation is not necessary, the residence is at least 1.5 mm.”
Parents were lucky.
After another prayer, the Franciscan was completely disappeared.
The spiritual nerge’s action of the Stwórce has started to experience as a teenager.
In the dream, pure souls came to him with a request for help.
I was builded in the night and sent to prayer for the dead and those who died at this moment – remember.
He also experienced the presence of the spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits the sin of death.
“My body began to change.
I lost human characters, and I started getting the animal's look," he says.
The invisible force dropped him up, and he couldn't hear his voice.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him a salvation.
“I was released in the waters of the river that symbolizes the holy baptization, and I returned to the human form...” he said.
No one said about these strange experiences.
He's been looking at the call.
He was 16 years old when he came to the French.
In the preaching work, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Charismatic Community Renew in the Holy Spirit
In the mixtures of the health of father Witko, many people are involved in the loss of illness.
However, spiritually stressed that their main goal is spiritual health, not fleshly.
First Male Cole FRAC Jarosław
Today (26 September, p. 26) the south team Col FRAC service has been assigned to the current master of Poland Dartom Bogorii Grodzisk Mazowicki in the framework of the 3th series of LOTTO Superligi Tenis.
Jaroslawing in such a personal meeting, which they had done with the gross, has no chance of winning with the sovereignty of the disease.
He showed this unique with Dart Bogoria.
There's no intake in the team leader of the team, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps there would be a third of the triumf series in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han is likely not yet growing to win with such duties as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirbék.
Not even with one of the most perspicuous Polands, or the Mark Badowski.
Hellady's leader was the biggest star in MOSiR Hall at the Sikorski district in Jaroslavu.
At the old time of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was the same class for himself.
After three individuals, Col FRAC led 2:
Cou Lei certainly played the Mark of Badowski, and Daniel Horak after the emotional, fifty - year - old battle — Paul Siruck.
But then he was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
It could have been hoped to win for two points, but Qiyao Han didn't spare the Badowski.
There's no tests for the elders.
Why?
In accordance with the prejudices of Rafala Trzaskowski, a free profilatic studies for the elderly of 70 and 80 years had been implemented in Warszawa.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the acceptance of the Ministry of Health and its submission to the Medical and Statistics Agency.
In justification, the agency said that the target group was wrong-handed.
“In the case of actions, the detection of honourable disease units may affect the deepness of NFZ performance and negatively affect the patient by providing non- and discomfort related to false positive studies,” it was observed.
The resort decision doesn't understand the President of the throne.
"The money are ours, we've provided the money for it.
Only the government fears that people are trying, then they will go to a doctor that is absurd, because it's just about the situation in which the profilatic may be made quickly.
All specialists know that it helps, it's about the health system, because it helps to quickly discover diseases and in a serious approach to health.
The Government has a very strange position here I don't understand," Rafal Trzaskowski said.
"I am proud to imagine that the big specialists say, "We don't worry, because there will be a longer range from the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I don't wonder that there is a health service in this situation," he added the PO policy.
Palestinian answers to Israel: We will conclude all existing agreements
The Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the United Nations Assembly session that he will break all agreements concluded with Israel, if the Government of this country is coming, trying to comply with Benjamin Netanjah's order on the anexies of the Palestinian land.
"If the government of Israel comes, which will come to the fulfillment of this plan, we will avoid all the signed agreements (with Israel) and we will turn away from all the commitments taken," he said.
"We'll remove the whole and completely the whole plan," he threatened with the pressure of Abbas.
"It is our way to protect all our rights by all possible centres – a little important, which will be the result – completely involved in implementing international law and fighting terrorism,” said the President of the Palestinian Autonomia, who had already made similar actions in July.
Netanjah, the current president of Israel, after the elections of 17 September, repeated the mission of the Government.
One week before the elections he said that if he wins them, he will announce anxiety of the Jordan valley and intends to include all Jewish seats in Israel on the west side.
At the beginning of the 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinians, whom Jaser Arafat was conducted, signed a number of peace agreements held by the United States.
The 84-year Abbas also promised the execution of the Palestinian general elections during the United Nations Assembly session.
The last occurred in 2006.
"When I return to the country, I call on the Western Mount, the Gaza Region and the East Jerusalem, local elections and everyone who would oppose them will have to answer their actions before God and the international community," said the Palestinian President.
Abbas also protected the speaking of the Palestinian rights, treated as a permanent guardian in the United Nations, to use the rights of the United Nations "full-righteous members and all its authorities and entities".
The Palestinian leader ended the calling for the international community to “be forced Israel to fulfil the whole respect of the United Nations statute”.
The ambassador of Israel, Danny Danon, replied shortly to Abbas, declared that the Palestinian leader would “concentre himself in the United Nations on the efforts of the Palestinian Autonomy against Israel than to fight against the calls to terrorism in Autonomia under his leadership”.
However, as noted by the agencies, Danon did not refer to the anexs of Palestinian earth.

105 million bad for companies feed video game from the National Test and Development Centre
Nearly 105 million of people are financed by the financing of a feeding company, which implies innovative solutions.
The National Studies and Development Centre announced in Friday, results III of the GameINN Edition.
Among nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, there was a design of a platform for the creation of land games based on the AR game engine of the real world's map, together with the enabled transmission of data through students; the test-school platform to verify practical ability to work and completed with the use of VR and AI; an innovative game that stimulates the management of real production processes by the innovative model of games based on the interaction of the wireous world with the real world using the concept of industrial 4.0 is given in the NCBR communication sent to the PAP.
The goal of the GameINN sector is to increase the competitiveness of the Poland sector of video players on the global market until 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Poland video game is already growing at 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Poland video game in 2016 resulted in 1,85 billion ills, for 2019 to 2,23 billion.
“The specially prepared GameINN Baèjk agenda and 300 million evil support for the leaders in the framework of this sectoral programme are a significant impulse for the further, dynamic growth of the Poland gamedeva” reads the Communication.
The Branz video game is an example of the effective use of the potential that we are available in Poland.
“Invited by the Government to promote innovations, such as B+R, box-completion programmes, IP box or support programmes carried out by the NCBR, contribute to innovative companies and allow them to be more effectively ratified on the very competitive market”, the vicepremier, the Minister of School and School of Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the communication.
The Science Boss notes that money for innovation is not only to innovators in the form of project financing but also remains in their boxes – from B+R in 2018, about three quarters more than a year ago.
“The amount of the numbered costs for the activity of B+R resulted in 1,7 billion wrongs, which gave more than 300 million insurance for companies using this obligation.
This is the equality of the support transmitted by NCBR in three GameINN editions," subscribes vicepremier.
Director NCBR Dr. Kameniecki is also reminded that in two previous concurrences of financing of a total value of over 211,2 million evil was granted to 78 news projects.
Great interest in competition III and the diversity of the proposals shows that the video game has ideas and skills to continue to develop and increase its competitive preferences.
“The fact that, as in previous editions, projects relating not only to divorce, but also related to industry 4.0 have been added.
In the third concurrence of GameINN for financing even 20 million of evils were able to be prevented from pre-processors, consortiums and consortiums with scientific units.
NCBR has affected 87 applications on a total amount of approximately 317 million of ills.
The competition budget at the time of the concurrence announced was 100 million evil, but it was increased, thus 27 projects were granted almost 105 million bad finance.
Specific information on the results III of the GameINN competition is available on the page →br.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector programme is implemented in the framework of the Intelligent Development Programme.
The NCBR adopted the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of those associated with the Polish Game Agreement, which includes a company such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11-bit studies.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admitted to the cover of Casper Dolberg
It happened on September 16.
Dolberg, who at the end of August traveled from Ajaxus Amsterdam to Nice, was pointed out after the training that his clock disappeared.
It wasn't quite, because the value of $70.
On the next day, the Danish wounds didn't appear on employment with the problems of the clusters.
The matter from the beginning was a funny thing.
Pysters in the hole have private seifs, and the club territory is monitored.
According to the AFP agency, he was admitted at the end of Diaby-Fadiga.
A 18-year-old, Dolberg and other colleagues of the team and Dr. Patrick Vierea have already apologize.
He also promised Danish to return the money for a time.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most perspicuous pillars of the young generation in France.
To Nicei, he came as a thirty-year-old, to debit three years later in the first team.
In this season, he appeared in seven swords.
He has not signed a professional contract, but, as the "L'Equipe" magazine, the club will probably deal with the immediate effect.
At the same time, he was increasingly disciplined against his prosecutor.
Nice, at least officially, refuses comments on this matter.
Check if you're sure you're stuck with your hands.
We all know that it's needed to be a moon (e.g. when you come home or before your household).
But everyone doesn't know that to actually lose the consequences, you need to do it properly.
This is particularly important now when heat infections are near.
At least 30 to 40 seconds to make a sufficient degree of dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And most of us are smaller!
It is uncertain that it must be antibacterial (a large doctors of course rebuild them).
We will not only feed the bottom and the tops of the hands, but also: the fingers of the fingers (combined or uniquely) – heal them with the cool moves inside the second hand, the breast between the fingers (pay the hands, throw the fingers of itself), the bottles – each of us, with the other hands, and in this way we turn them on a moment to the right and the left.
In a warrant (if you can't smile your hands) we should cut hands with a cushion mocker, and then with an antibactery iron (in drugs, from 5 p.m.).
Following the public toilet, do not touch your hands or doors (recommendation of the Chief Health Inspector).
Open them through the paper manual.
The President of Iran says he has rejected the proposal of talks from the United States, Donald Trump prohibited.
Teheran did not interview with the American side during the United Nations O'O'S Collection in New York, despite the Americans' offers of sanction, he declared the President of Iran Hasan Rowhani on Friday.
The President of the United States Donald Trump commented that this is the Iranian side who asked the deterioration of restrictions that he did not agree.
According to the President of Iran Hasan Rowhani, the Americans proposed that all the sanctions imposed on Teheran were replaced by negotiations on a new international agreement.
It should be regulated as well as the Iranian nuclear programme, as well as the Balistic Press Building Programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not take conversations in the maximum pressure atmosphere
The President of Iran concluded that he did not agree to take these talks because of “toxic atmosphere”.
He declared that he met the American diplomats because he departed from France, Germany and the Great Britain.
However, he stressed that Iran would not take a talk in the "maximum pressure" atmosphere.
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in form 5+1, no one can predict the result of the end," Rowhani said.
One day before, the Iranian leader said that he did not exclude the talks from the United States, and to the parties of the nuclear agreement, he made the promotion of the American sanction in Iran.
He added that sanctions in Iran after the United States had come out of the nuclear agreement "is a preliminary condition that does not allow" to commit a dialogue.
If we are able to deal with this preliminary condition and if America brings sanctions and the maximum pressure, then we can talk to America, he stated.
He added that he didn't exclude the meeting with President Donald Trump, although he did not agree with such conversations in a change week during the United Nations Collection.
Trump: "Iran," I said no.
Donald Trump was on Twitter that it was he who repeated the Iranian page's request.
"Iran wanted me to break the sanctions on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said no!”, the President of the United States.
Press with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United States are trying to fix the pressure between Washington and Teheran to save an agreement with Iran from 2015, which was signatures.
She concluded that, in replacement of the reduction of economic sanctions, Iran refuses from the nuclear protection programme, and the nuclear sector is under control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA).
Since the United States dismissed from the agreement in May 2015, its signatures immediately confirmed that they wanted to make an agreement in force.
It's not going out of this.
Waszyngton applies to the tactic of maximal pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include full immigration for Iran.
Teheran said that if he doesn't refer to the export of a sugar, what 60 days would limit his obligations resulting from the agreement.

The Governing Court of Justice in Warszawa and the husband of Emilia's leader who, according to its words and §s of WhatsAppa, participated in the stalling against judges, was returned to an argue by NSA.
The reason is that it has not been initiated by the disciplinary procedure, and there is therefore no reason for supporting the president WSA Wojciecha Mazura to remove it from.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary responsibility at NSA, concluded an explaining procedure against Smidt, but it did not translate it to this time in proceeding against him.
Although the NSA, in such a ways acting as a disciplinary court, must be taken by the President of WSA within a month after its issue.
In this case, a judge who has publicly spoken of the psychical problems of his own in order to discreet it, which, due to the suspicion of participating in the Headquarters Group, has been held from the Office of KRS, will return to the Office and will issue judgments in the name of the Poland Royal Policy.
Judge Smidt prohibits his share in the Headquarters Group.
He states that there is no evidence for this but the false words and words of his dealing with it.
That is exactly the same thing that the rest of the judges related to “Cast” say: all of them are innocent, no evidence.
And they're very likely to put them on their own.
Because the procurement doesn't cut the finger to protect the conduct from their electronic mechanisms, it also takes care of the contents of Emilii Schmidt's phone, which held this phone in June in another case.
The police didn't kiss the hair to protect the devices of persons that he indicated as a prosecutor in bringing Judge Waldemar Jurk from February.
There's no evidence – there's no Smidt case, no "Casty".
There is also no case of Chief N° Marian Banasia to take the rocks to the suteners and to hide income.
The CBA will check his own declarations.
And he'll check when he's checking.
The Commission of Poland's Ethics will not be taken by Banas because Sejm is suspended (but the Commission of State Control has sometimes been gathered to make a decision on the revocation of Banasia's substitutes and claims as its lawyers, although it does not provide the law of such an exceptional combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a film novel, a American mistake, about how she comes home and stands a man with a loved man in bed.
She's so disappointed and disappointed that she can't get out of words.
He stands in the doors of the one, and then the loving woman quickly gets out of bed, gets out and goes out.
And the husband was a bed.
When she plays a voice and cries: "What is this?"
Who's that woman?
The husband is quietly asking, "What woman, honey?"
Only the case of Casty or Banasia is a parodium of the country.
And that's not funny.

I hope that everything will be fine," he said to the Cornel Moravicki in the talk with “SE”.
"If I had been undertaken too lately, this situation would be tragic and tragic..." he added.

It's the power of the springs.
The title of amator’s sports injuries played on Sunday 15 September on the hypodrome at Oleandry Street in Olava, may be for the mistake.
To the true power of the way, because it's far away, but that's the name of one of the types of horse rivalisation...
The concurrence of spring forces is to be destroyed by the trainer and the horse, which are even more than two meters in the most pressive international disorders.
It is worth adding here that the annual and incidence of the world's unmortal record, established yet in 1949, by the Chilian Albert Larraguibel, on the horse “Huaso”, is 247 cm.
So high in Olaví, of course, no one shocked, but the result of the best local amazone at level 135 cm to the worst must not be...
The injuries organized by an unusual Jana Sienkiewicz and other JKS operators “In seedle” were an indicative part of the previously played “Free trips” in this magazine number, page 22.
Eight amazons traveling in the Olaw JKS have arrived in rivalisation.
Four bought on cooks, and four on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szolvra is the best writer, who's getting a crazy "Sprinter".
This little, but how dynamic the rubber was discovered from the extent of 40 cm high, and ended just at the stationation with the top white remote from the ground at 125 cm.
However, it was not easy to submit and only after three further refuses, the jury was rejected from further liquidation.
The second place in the rocks shots was taken by Amelia Pawlak, which was accompanied by the "Famy" and the third Lena Bouñ on "Harmider".
Ambitally, the youngest tournament tournament - Inga Aksman, galoping and scattering by a small "Carmen" key.
More more emotions were associated with the starting amazons and views during the competition with big horses.
Increasing disasters have been calculated by Paulina Szewčik, who arrived in "Declarations" and Anastasia Abramenko, who went to "Lotce".
Happy outside the great destructions, or the amazons, or the horses did not happen, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of a young "Wineta" key to the park had to reach her Veronika Luczkievicz.
She needed an assistant trainer, or another horse to a couple who's got a little crazy "Wineta".
After calculating a disorder from the park, he also eat with full force, so in the boxes and on the dissolved moments it was dangerous. "All is under control!", John Sienkiewicz repaired a little of these scared visions, especially those youngests.
Since the beginning of the big horses, Marta Masalska is a good park, which is a beautiful "Whisky".
This basket, in a couple of experienced amazons, after the second approach in the final phase, the first crossed 135 cm, and it was the best result of the injuries at this point.
However, at the same time, Paulin Szewčik also recalled the same height on the "Declaration", Veronika lukkiewicz on "Winete" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Voots".
For the decoration of the flo, and after the receipt of the recompense in the form of the roadshop, all of these soldiers went out together, and at the end, together with the amazons on the cocktails of Radecki's March, they made an effective honoured round, ending the interesting and emotional distress.

Max Kolonko declines from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which political form #R Revolution Marius Max Colonki had to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution addressed its proposal in particular to young electors on legal views.
Before the elections, Colonko talked about Mark Jakubia, whether Paul Kukiz, but no of these coalitions came, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko could not even collect a sufficient number of signatures to present lists in any of the electoral areas in Poland.
Now Colonko reported on Twitter that he ended the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I'll wait for in/w KWW to draw my name with my name.
He will, please, inform about the non-compliance of my person with the entity referred to in/in," he added and said that more information will be given to the entry.
If not, whether the journalist will continue his action, whether it's the end of the form of #R Revolution.
4 July, in the American Day Needleg, the journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, informed about the new political formation - #R Revolution.
In the past years, Colonko sent the YouTube channel Max TV to comment on events in Poland and in the world.
"We have plenty of policies, enough of your hard games, enough of your government amators.
The time for the governments in the country to take the Nation and rule for the good Nation, said Colonko.
The Partie's programme included the legality (the general elections should be chosen), the tax changes (combination of the amount free from tax for all), the repairs (in the form of aid for the Eastern NATO flag, with respect to Poland), the transfers on the holding of the protection, the limitation of the number of staff or the introduction of electoral areas.
A few days after the announcement of the new political form of Mariusz Max Kolonko came to talk with Mark Jakubia.
At the end of July, Colonko placed his profile in the medium-speed information suggesting that #R is the power with Kukiz'15 move.
However, no of these coalitions finally arrived.
UBS: Gold near the equivalent point
"The euro curse will be maintained in the nearest months in the areas of the bullet 4,35 evil, which will be associated with the weak conjunction on the global markets," says Michael Bolliger with UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of sustaining a solid economic growth and a sustainable monetary policy are discussed by the stabilising of gold notes on the current puzzle," assesses the specialist in the conversation with Bankier.pl.
In spite of the clear pressure of the Inflationary Policy Council, it does not decide to subdue steps in the area in which the majority of central banks are aware of the policy.
“When the gold is actually evaluated – the euro notes should be maintained in the nearest months in the areas of the pool of 4,35 poll – so little attractive are the Polish obligations according to it.
More than half paper rentality offers commitments from incoming markets," evaluated Michael Bolliger, the operator of activity allocation on the markets entered into UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialists, the main threat to the Poland economy is the pollution of the conjuncture worldwide.
"The global release can still be deep, but it should not be to the heavy recession, and the most important to the wall of PKB's dynamic is not significantly lower than zero," says Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should not take the global actions that may not be able to harm the absence of trade conflict on the US-Chine line and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump impeachment procedure and brexit.
The most weakest Europe should be held between the markets," resulted from the newest letter to the investors of the main authority manager UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
"Actions from the euro area countries should be worse than the Americans because they are more taxable under the conditions of uncertainty around the global trade and fear of release," we read in the document.
The fact that Michael Bolliger, after the markets of the most safe countries, has decreased the rentality of the German 10-years even to minus 0.74 per cent, is still possible to deepen the depth of rentability.
Nevertheless, in the longer period, the rental of term papers should not be more, but only short-term, in order to reduce the monetary policy of major banks.
The largest floor field has Fed, which should be to weak the American currency in the next years.
The long-term equality point for euro notes is 1,29 USD, which would mean a 19 percent potential to strengthen the common currency for dollars.
We're waiting for further decreases of the Food foot, which will be done by the difference in the world's monetary policy.
"To maintain a long-term dollar force, they may not allow deficits to make a bie and budgetary account," says Michael Bolliger.
Bundeswehra loses the gun.
Faithful report of German MON

Crying kids in the plane.
How to avoid them?
It's a solution.
The Japan Airlines carrier applies to the idea of persons whose traveling in your first child is cosmmar.
On the Internet site, lines can check the distribution of locations in the aircraft.
If this connection travels in a year to the second year of life, “the child's icon” appears on a specific, reserved by parents or seats-holders.
The same person who uses the carrier services has the possibility of selecting the place remote from the acquired by a minor.
The BBC states that the lines have already been informed of the failure of this resolution.
‘the child’ does not appear when the ticket was reserved by a third person or if the aircraft change was recently made.
As you could expect, the idea shared the internautes.
Parts of Twitter's travellers indicate that the problem of traveling with the older children can be resolved by the listener that reduces the halas.
They're kids, and we've been sometimes.
"We have to learn tolerance, because in short, we start to need maps of places sitting for breathing mouths, dressing or drinking," said G Sundar.
Another of the interviews said that sometimes he had hurt his children in the aircraft, but he changed his opinion when he became a parent.
It also does not miss solutions introduced by Japan Airlines.

The ‘Cyste poë’ effects of the program are no, and the carbon pieces will cover this winter as if nothing,’ we read on the first page of today's ‘Cetchpopolite’.
“To this time, in the framework of the Chiste Po©e Programme, 82 thousand proposals for the finance of a total value of 2 billion wrongs, of which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
The requests accepted are summarized for more than 915 million evils, which gives "Rz" by the Deputy of the Ministry of the Environment.
As a newspaper, the program only returns part of the costs.
The reporter's reporter's reporter's reputation as "small".
The self-governmental authorities, quoted by “Rz”, are observed by the deficiencies of the “Christi Poõa” in a too large bureaucracy.

This would improve action," considers the Burmester of the Warminian Jacek Wiśniowski Lizbar.
Assets from the Polish Alarms are noticed that in the first year the action has been performed less than 1 per cent for the purpose of exchange of 3 million cocktails.

The manufacturer Barbie introduced a series of neutralitic lakes on the market
Besides Barbie with different colors of skin, figures or frishers, Mattel's company introduced to the sale of neutro-neutral lakes.
Travels from the "Creatable World" series have perucos.
Thus, children can see whether their Barbie has short hair or long.
Their garden is compared to from the bottom, as well as from the woods.
In the middle of the eye, the girl may become boys and turn back.
They are also available in the colours of skin and with different wheat.
It is also rejected from sharing of characteristics – gender lakes have no longer full mouths, long rows and rocks or, in the case of Kena, broad ramions.
The company believes that children don't like when their lakes have a standard, and some parents and feminists are convinced that funerals made with a particular thinking of girl ambitions and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"The new lakes will allow all children to be free," says Mattel.
The Barbie Lake, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a busy machine and bottles on a high-country town, was in excess critical for the propagation of "unusual female stereotypes", such as an unnatural proportion of these.
The concern reacted to a critical and already introduced the skin colors market, as well as the more surrounded forms.
There were also lakes in the hidgeby.

According to Zandberg, the left may have 60 to 80 staff.
“This may mean that around or club together will have a number of members.
But it depends on the Police and the Poland.
I'm not going to agree and say how it's going to happen," he said.
A question is whether the Lewica will have a separate round together, Zandberg answered: “We are agreed that we are different, and we will not believe that there is no differentity.
I think that the Poland's diversity was recompensed because we showed that differently, we were able to agree with the common programme."
A question, whether the biggest beneficiary of the common start is leader S -- Government of Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that his greatest beneficiaries are central and left electors.
In view of the fact that this S^ will receive the whole subvention, he replied that “the objective of the political party is to represent its electors”.
Zandberg admitted that in the elections to Seim he votes for himself.
In the case of the elections to the Senate, he was concerned.
“The offer is different, and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further,” he said.
"Instead, I say very honestly and that if I had been in the 44-senack circonstance, they would take the election statement and vote in another circuit," he underlined the policy.
“It was not trying to revoke a vote to the Ministry of Agency (Kandydata KO - PAP),” he added.
In this surrounding area, the leader of the RP Obhabitants is launched by Paul Kasprzak and Marek Rudnikki from PiS.
Dakar: Open the largest shot in West Africa
Tenths of those people from the Senegal were gathered on Friday in the throne on the instruction of a great beach, which was considered the greatest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by buses, cars and songs in Bopp, where a new shot was standing, which could place 30 thousand faithful.
The object was built by Mouride's brother, but to the Successful Islamic Society, which dominates in Senegal.
The work on the shot began ten years ago in the sub-sub-sector area of six hectares transferred by the Government.
The name of Massalicul Jinan (‘Roads to Paradise’) comes from the title of Ahmadou Baba Mbacke, the XIX-year-old brotherhood employer, honored by the representatives as holy.
It's a carriage marmor and has mineres.
The best of them has 78 meters.
The beach in the middle of the place of 15 thousand faithful, and the other can live in the outer esplanade.
In richly completed inners, you can surprise the broken cup, gigantic jerandols and decorations manually made by workers from Marokko.
Buildings say that the wall is the largest in Western Africa, but there is no comparison with the beaches in other regions.
In Marokko, Hassana II's shot in Casablance can place 105 thousand faithful.
The building of more than 30 million euros was financed from private gifts.
The Government, other than the earth, funded lighting, health devices and financed travel robots with values of EUR 10,5 million.
Trainer Smylla: Our problem isn't Sleep, only we're alone
The pass of eight liquor swords without winning Coronas are trying to break in the fifth meeting with the Sleuc Extreclass Vicelider.
"Our problem isn't recycling, only we, we must work on what we play," stressed the trainer of the nice Miroslav Smylla.
The last Korona pillars and the only victory in humans were noted in the first series when the outcome was completed at 1:0 a dynamic playing of Available Cancers.
Later, the kitchen recorded two remises and six divorces, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with the Lubin deep in 1/32 Pucharu Polski final.
"I feel optimistic that in the last seconds of the pucker sword, the pillars fighted for the door, they wanted to remise.
Their fall on the wall after the last wheel didn't result from breaking, but it was only a fall from -- because they were so close," said Smylla.
As he said, Slask has very strong glasses, so he will teach a team to play in the sides of the streets.
"We have the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," added the trainer.
In the fifth sword in Corona, it is certainly not going to play a pause for the over-dimensional cards of Firen Gnjatic, which will also be missed by the constraints of Jacob Žubrowski and Michael Gariscevski.
The building, however, is a report in the pucker sword of a few players with a desired game.
"We have a head, it wasn't seemed to be, and now it is," said Smylla.
The defenseman of the Corony Daniel Dünyel highlighted that Slash will not be an easy rival to break the eight liquor swords from a row without winning, rather, each can win with everyone in the extraclass.
“We're in the sleeve.
In the last weeks we may not show it on the boss, but this moment will come to win and we believe that it will be on Friday," said the pilgrim.
After nine rows of the Coron extraclass with five points in position 15.
The slider assembled 12 more and flooded on the other place.
The fifth sword in Kielcah is at 20:30 a.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
“42 per cent of the trees of Europe's trees are threatened” warns the International Union of Nature Protection (IUCN) in the fifth, published in the “Roue Trees”.
In the head of the list, there are castanics and jarabins.
IUCN, a organization sitting in Gland in Switzerland, publishs a list of dangerous trees in the first time.
It was designed by specialists who have come to the conclusion that from 454 types of trees in Europe (as well as in other parts of the world) 42 per cent is “in a high degree of threatened”.
In the middle of the Red toga, the rapid growth of the climate aglomeration and the global climate changes.
However, the most dangerous are these trees and trees that are only or mainly in our continent.
In the case of typically tree, IUCN specialists threatened are 58 per cent of species, and 15 per cent, namely 66 trees and blood species, the extinction.
Among the main deforestation Red toga refers to errors in the driving of the treestone, accelerated urbanization, too intensive trees, and in the next series of forest fires and changes in ecosystems.
According to the authors of the report, there is also a significant threat to the existence of many varieties of raw, mixture and growth.
"The effects of human activity lead to a gradual loss of plants and create a risk in Europe to lose important and unvaluable differences that constitute the foundation of ecosystems and affect our planet's health," recalled the Luc Bas report, which leads to the IUCN office.
Greeter Schetin: I don't promise 600+
"Today, PiS wants to buy Polands by offering them freedom for a credit that will have to pay for the future generation," Gregorz Schetin says in the outcome for the "Cetchpolite".
His statement, “all PiS policy is pipe”.
At the same time, the policy promises that “the data will not be prohibited”.
She's talking to Jack Ninkewicz that she's got the idea of dealing with the law and justice.
It's the mobilization of the electorate at the electoral urnes.
His opinion, the opposition has greater potential in this regard than the Kakinian party.
"The people today who want to be in a normal country are more than PiS, a party who has been convinced with preached values, such as humility, humility, transparency," says Schetin.
The leader of the Civil Coalition and the leader of the Civil Platform also constituted a fundamental KO electoral programme.
"For the first time, nothing of the data will be taken, but you need to specify the direction for the future, because PiS is only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for the Poland, even though it is dramaticly no investment," he said.
Secondly, it's about the "building of the Poland energy, assistance and investment in those who are rightly working - and those who are pre-generators".
The chairman of the KO has been found in the KO program, which is a project that gives at least 614 gold in the hand, and more workers – also after several hundred.
The politician also said he wouldn't want to go to the divorce.
As he said, he's doing so much he can do, but he doesn't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek warrant, where the Governors have been licensed with the opposition to the network until the finance of the country is finally fallen," he subscribed.
It also stated that Jaroslav Kakinski and Mateus Morawicki are afraid to discuss with him and the Malgorat Ki-Blanc.
"We'd use their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“Picha steps before falling.
Kakinian is a man of status like Banas is critical," he added.
Leader PO also said that he had not yet agreed whether it would be able to carry out Platform.
Argentine: Six Dead Condors
In the Portuguese province of Santa’z found six dead condors – informs TVN24.
Specialists believe that human activity has been to their deaths.
The big condors have probably been adequate with measures to kill scarlets such as pumps, lises or wild dogs.
The animals could eat a toxic fall.
Besides one young person, the rest of the dead condors was adult.
“It is a great loss for the environment, because the condore must reach 10 to 15 years to become adequate and ability to multiplie.
So we lose the protected species, the kind of threatened," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, of the argentinian organisation who cares for the protection of the environment.
"I think the use of toxicity is not only the type of danger, but all other forms of life, including human health," adds.

The Russian work on the granting of the head of the country of drugs.
The idea supported the Office of Andréy Dudy – we read in the "Reshpopolite".
As a magazine, it's about the golden lances of the Order of Orla Bia, the king's insygnium officially called during the intergovernmental lowliness of the Rzechipospolite.
The last time, the President Ignacy Misticki was probably using him.
The "Rz" suggests that the incidence of such bottles can get on the arm of Andréy Dudy.
The Commission of the Rights of the Members, of the Government and of the Petition has voted in the middle of a request to take action on the novelisation of the law of orders and derogations to restore it.
The journal writes that this is not the first trial to restore this boat to the country's head.
The Senate has proposed this amendment since 1992, but it has passed by one voice.
This time the work is brilliant.
At the beginning of August, the Senators dedicated this matter a few minutes, recognized that they would be able to assume the opinion of the President's office.
This came half September.
"I shall inform that the President of RP's office does not refer to the position presented in this petition," then the President Andrzej Der.
In the middle of the case, the Commission continued and repeatedly dedicated the matter a little time.
"Cancelaria President's answer we're shortly: it's about to restore it," said the Commissioner Robert Mamutow from PiS, quoted by "Rz".
He reported the proposal to take the legislative work which the Commission supported.
The police will teach drivers how to drive through crossing
Police action will be carried out, in particular, to cross Al. Ceeplin from al. Pilsudski.
Monetary activities have a little relationship with the unclean complaints of the town authorities on drivers who are not always able to keep properly on crossing.
On Friday, 27 September, the police shall report in the Preventive Action "Previous Crossing".
This is the elimination of pollution in the movement: running to crossing without the possibility of running, unjustifying light signals or travel signals.
"We often think that we are alone on crossing and so we really strengthen our lives with other drivers," said Marek Ustrobinski, vice-president of the city a few days ago.
His words were drawn up on the press mouse, on which the city authorities presented examples of an inadequate movement of cars after crossing, which makes steps.
The president then called to the travelers for a trip, including a faster movement on the lights or a non-written SMS during the road.
The theme has been taken by the police officers who have since discussed the action “Previous Crossings”.
What's going on?
The objective of the action is to eliminate the evidence of the limitation of transition on crossings by drivers who run on them without the possibility of continuing the vehicle.
This is the most common extent that is involved in strengthening disorders in the movement and creating steps.
It is threatened by the mandate of 300 evils and 2 penalties.
Moreover, the monarchs will take attention to the non-adjustment of light signals or travel signals and wrong parking in the crossing area.
They will also continue the lack of vehicles, the later movement under signalizers, the free movement of cross-borders and the left-off of too large distances after vehicles.
What crossings will be carried out?
M.in. to the ul. Lisa-Kuli from the ul. Jagiellońska; al. Ceplin from al. Pylsudski; Targê z al. Pylsudski; Place de Mirniavits from Dubrowski or the Hetmanian of Al. Warszawa.
This type of action in the subcarpace stole will be conducted in the next fifth of October.

Inspectors from the Romanian age conducted a control in the forests belonging to the Greenca.
The Private Company Handlowo-Transport “Dar-Trans”, through a 100-Trans contract, performs the management services with trailing waste.
"The installation's eye was made, and it was also requested to provide a documentation related to its activity," said Szyszko.
He added that the check report would be submitted to the Governing Board of the Environmental Protection Inspector in Warsaw.
The last control in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Leader of the Environment Protection Inspector in Warszawa during the period 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
It was then established that the company did not have downloaded the tests, measurements and underground water studies and did not have the results of stabilised communal stakeholders with the ‘Cayka’ stationary sticks.
After the control of the WHO Dariusz Sabbath, it was called to stop the violation of the conditions of decision.
The Private Company Handlowo-Transport “DAR-TRANS” Dariusz Sabbath is one of the receiving waste companies in the form of stabilised communal stations with the "Czajka".

As the asset Heynena Michal City Gogol, this time the main job was not the same execution of the elements of the seatkar.
"We went to the hall, but most of them it was time for a group.
It was about to get him more together than to train.
Talk, wonder how to rebuild all of this as a wheel," he related.
He confirmed that the half-final damage was a painful lesson compared to the leaders and to the school.
“We were brutally brought to the earth.
Without two opinions, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd be back to that sword.
We discussed the sword between us in the stage, the trainer talked a lot with the leaders.
As two main wounds, it indicates the inefficiency in the attack and much worse than with the racing of the stakeholders.
The Slovenians were so much better than we," he analyzed.
His report, "White-Red" has not become anxiety related to a statement against the voting and numerous publicity of the co-governmental tour.
He admitted that the world's masters could sleep a little hot road to the halffinal.
“It may be, if we had a deceit in a similar stage, we would soon examine this lesson, and then we would play in the next stage of tournament.
But it's just a shot," he shot.
Gogol hopes that the crime related to the quarter of Polacom can be put into an aggression in the bridge sword.
“I hope we will then show our true face.
There's something to worry about.
The last medal of ME we've been fighting in 2011," he reminded.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by the Poland during these masters.
At the group phase, they were rivalized in Rotterdame and Amsterdam, at the first two meetings of the group, to Appeldoorn, and moved to Lublana to the half-final.
Nick Kyrgios: Sugar pain, but in suspension
The tennisist was a 16-week starting prohibition and a rubber of $25 – in a half-year suspension – for appealing words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tours.
ATP World Tour today loses patience to Kyrgios, but they still give him the opportunity to improve.
The summary of the most uncircumcised tennis for the last years seems terrible – 16 weeks of interruption plus harmful, but both offences are injected for a half year – a period of trial in which the snow sporter will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios has only 24 years of age, but he has already developed and has reached his tennis record of the world – he had to pay the most worth in the history of the discipline a single financial penalty for the breaking of the rules of behavior in the court and near it.
Voice curses, strange gestures, unsported behavior, judges and visions, breaking two rackets during the lost sword with Karen Chačanov – for this all after the August ATP Masters 1000 in Cieininati payed 113 thousand dollars.
In US Open 2019, he also did not play, but was publicly told that the ATP operators were “superpowered”, which affected the authorities of the organization so much that they conducted the disciplinary research against Cyrgyz and after a few weeks had given a recorded quota of the breakdown of starts and other worrying.
However, the word of corruption was forgiven to him, after hearing the accused and knowledge of the context of the statement.
However, in the justification of tennis operators, the investigation showed that the behaviour of Cyrgiosa by ca. 12 men in many areas was a significant preservation and was almost a continuation of violation of the rules that the Ulgarian persons related to turkeys and visions without a stop.
However, the ATP gave him the days of revocation and once refused the execution of the sentence, ordering the fulfilment of a number of conditions in the nearest six: in the ATP Tour tourneys and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios, it can no longer distort the code of the procedure of professional tennisists, in particular it cannot curse, destroy the rackets, divorce with judges and publicity, nor can any other way be inappropriate and vulgary.
He also received a recommendation to search for "support" from mental trainers during tourneys, and also outside the season, he consulted persons specialised in resolving the problems of sporters who do not face their own behavior.
The first comment (in the medium media) was Nick Kyrgiosa to the jardin: “Hey, all of you, I can play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, he will have at least two-year breaks, since he had a consent of the ship in Puchar Lavera, so he had to refuse from the nearest starts in Peking (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the morning of the ATP Kyrgios at 27th place.
In this year, he wined two tours — in Washington and Acapulco, gained more than 1,3 million down, so even after the wounds it will be a lot.
GUS: In Poland, he lives better
From the report published in Friday by the GUS on the budgets of the households, it is evident that its material situation has been evaluated in ub.r. to 44 per cent of them.
In the year before, this percentage was 37.2 per cent, in 2016 33.5 per cent, and before – since 2009, when the statistical authority first examined the situations of the households – he never exceeded 30 per cent.
Its material situation was deemed to be wrong or more, including 8.1 per cent of households, compared to 11.2 per cent of the year before and more than 20 per cent in 2009.
The best is the situation of material businesses of people who work for their own accounts.
In this group, more than 70 per cent of respondents were considered good or more.
On the other hand, the households of retistors are at least 18 per cent of these replys.
The number of children has also a significant impact on the sub-valuation of the situation of the material households.
The worst is known to parents in the same nature, among which a good or more material situation is 32 per cent.
The weight (in dependence on the number of children) between 55 and 60 per cent of children with children is 48.8 per cent and between the unkind households is 48.8 per cent.
In these statistics, the effect of the program 500+ is clearly visible.
Before he was injured (in 2016) the worst of their material situation, parents evaluated their own experienced semen and multi-year families (with at least three children).
The improvement of the subsequent assessments of the Poland material situation is the repealing of the rapid growth of income, especially from the work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households, which consider their situation as good, increases faster than real incomes.
Moreover, at the level of leadership there is no clear dependence between income levels and the evaluation of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are formulated by the people of the opolous leader, where their situation is a good or nice 48.9 per cent of the investigated.
Furthermore, the leadership of the Lithuania (47.7 per cent), the sale (47.6 per cent), the Mawwski (47.3 per cent) and the Western Sea (47.1 per cent).
However, the regulatory income (e.g. after payment of taxes and contributions) in Opolsk was 94 per cent of the average national and in Lubusk 98 per cent.
The most important income of Mazovski residents (120 per cent of the average national) and Spanish (104 per cent).
In the meantime in Poland, the regulatory income for person was in 2018 1693.
In fact, it increased by 4,3 per cent in 2017 (with the correction of price changes) in 2017.
In the past years, the result is low enough.
In 2016, the income to person increased by 7 per cent, and the year later by 6,3 per cent.
Despite the growth of the income, it also reduces the growth of the expenditure.
These in the calculation of a person have occurred in ub.r. 1187 evil, which means that they have decreased by 0.7 per cent in the real rate.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017, expenses per person were actually increased by 1,9 per cent and in 2016 by 4,3 per cent.
The budgetary examination of the households suggests that the statistical economy currently issues 70.1 per cent of its regulatory incomes, while that share was more than 80 per cent in 2014 and over 90 per cent until 2006.

United States: Three suicide among the aircraft
Three mariners have done suicide on the USS George H. W. Bush ship last week – reported the American marinary.
In the last two years, five members of this ship have been killed.
Previous suicide was still in July that year, and previously in November 2017.

Each of the events arrived on the floor when the USS George H. W. Bush was buying at Virginia's station.
As soon as, the share of third parties has been excluded.

I want to submit that there is no gmatization or other effects related to the search of help," he was on Facebook Sean Bailey, the leader of the ship.
Nesiolovically critically about the paper.
John Paul II did nothing
In the conversation with Peter Lexish Stefan Niesiolovski, John Paul II was a great authority in 1981.
"In fact, his statement was accepted."
Later the criticism of his actions appeared.
“For me, that John Paul II was not able to defeat the damage of Ridji's activities, it is a great darkness on his pontification.
But this remptorist, the church and the Poland, has developed its media in the best for the life of Polaka's father, ".
The former Policy of the PO admitted: “There were uncomfortable deaths, the father said something, the Ridjic had never accepted, but he had authority and political authority, and he could just send him out of the Church or send him to a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the birds.
However, John Paul II did not do this, like his followers," explained Nesiolovski.
“In addition, this fatal case of pedofilia and the church’s actions, and in fact, their lack.
I've been a little away from thinking, but I wanted to give attention to the whole life of his life.
We know about the pedofilia scale in the Church of a relatively unclean.
There is a question of how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know of these abominable things," says the newspaper Nesiolovski.
In the evaluation of the former Policy of Poland the Church is a partner of PiS.
“We must admit that the church was our most important partner during the Solidarity period.
All the holidays began from the sanctuary, and all the cross were crossed everywhere.
Now these cross are written, they became a symbol of dictature — a sign of writing mode.
I repeat: One of the most unfriendly surprises is that such people like Ridjiz the third Poland Church that John Paul II did nothing about this and that the Church is a partner of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will come to pay his sun," Nesiolovski convinced.
"I hope that the Francisco's father's hurt of Yudrachew, Ridjika and some of these other types," he summoned.

Both names will be recorded in one line – first after Poland, and the following in the original, in the navigation.
This will be a great easier for people who do not know the writer names of foreign cities in the country in which they are.

After the divorce and visit to the veterinarian, somebody made a target from the animal — in his body found a wind-shirt.
“Information on the wounded bird has been from the inhabitants of the Medium of the Rehabilitation of the Devils in the New Soil.
The statement showed that the animal had broken glasses.
We went to the place.
It was once to see that something's wrong with him.
We did quickly and precisely so that we wouldn't hurt him and not put it on stress.
The lab was taken away, and he's getting to the veterinary.

Gowin: "We have to build a Poland, a small trade"
"The successful taxation of hypermarkets does not resolve the problem of a crucial trade, it will be necessary to wonder whether the country has some instruments to build the Poland trade," said Vicepremier, Minister for School and School, leader of the Jaroslav Gowin Agreement on Friday.
Gowin during the conversation in the “Signal Days” in the Radio Onece concluded that the trade is based on international networks that make the Poland producers so low margins that the Poland companies cannot actually develop.
Notice that this problem was very difficult to fight, vicepremier recalled that the Government of PiS was trying to meet it at the beginning of the mandate, but got a "contact from the KE".
"We have won before the court of justice and I hope that the United Law wins the nearest elections and forms the government, we will return to this issue," he said.
At the same time, he noted that “the successful taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the political problem, and thus crucial trade”.
"In addition, it will be necessary to wonder whether the Government, the State, has some instruments that allow the Poland trade to build," said Gowin.
In May, the EU court recognised that the European Commission had made a mistake in recognition of that the Poland tax from the sale of details is not allowed by public aid.
The provision of the tax from the sale of detailed investment is to introduce two tax rates from the market: 0.8 % from the income between 17 million and 170 million evil in the middle and 1.4 % from the income by 170 million.
The tax should be applied from September 2016.
KE in September 2016 started the process of violation of the Union law by Poland.
Brussels then argumented that the tax may be able to make smaller decisions, which may be recognised as public assistance.
She concluded that the Danin was in force in a manner incompatible with the law.
It also gave the order to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis was completed by the officers in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax price was suspended.
The EU Court's decision on the way to repeat the tax, but it did not end the matter.
On 24 July, the Commission made a revocation in the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSEU pressing service reported the PAP that the case is currently at a written stage in which the European Commission and the Polish Government represents their written arguments.

It needs a few to a few of the owners from the revoking to the sentence of the sentence.
"This procedure is a middle-year period," said the PAP in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How do you get a child to get baptized?
We submit a few practical solutions
Baptizing is an important delight in life of childhood and his parents.
It is often the first occasion in which the child is concentrating around the whole family, jointly celebrating his appearance in the world.
That's not surprising that my mother and dad wants their comfort to look as well on that day.
But before you take a final decision about the child’s machine, ask if it will be worth it.
For there are many machines that don't make a little comfort.
What, then, should we take attention?
The basic criteria for the baptism is a child’s age
Moreover, a few - hours - old little bottles were baptized in white teams and in the same beaches or big pools.
Today, children accessing to sacrament are often elderly: a number of years, even larger.
It's not difficult to realize that such a great comfort needs a little more to get baptized .
It is therefore your child on the day of baptism will have 3 to 4 months, probably a holiness in a car or in the hands of parents or baptized ones.
The best outcome will be shown to this equipment in a well-built, bathed spies or completes.
Although this element of the garden is recognised as a cool daily, it is enough to search for its holiday warrants, such as a falbank or a coronary.
For the perfect boy, points are shown with the pressure of the muscle and the wheel.
In the case of elderly children, you can be allowed to be more fantasy in the bathroom.
The girl's going to look slightly in a simple, tiulous cute
Many parents with disturbance look at the rich, falsuous battles of baptized baptism in the complex with the rocks, the rocks and the bottles.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers applies to their manufacture arts, incorruptible materials in which the child is simply inappropriate.
In searching for a suitable brake, you will be better looking at the Asanti for Kids magazine, which offers elegantic machines on the battled undergrounds.
Delicate, thiulous bathrooms, satynian kitchens, corners, and beautiful completes will make your corner look too much and feel comfortable.
Ideal chair for a gentleman: Battled garniture
Moreover, among the parents of the boys, the mode of the garniture was a copy of the "small" models.
Polyestrous mariners and below, steady council or caskets often made young elastings proof of their disappreciation.
Today, for happiness, they have been exposed by good, battled completes.
See the teams available in Asanti for Kids, or white, dress, and to this blue ozioned from forward to the pattern of a camel.
These machines seem to be awesome, and at the same time they do not break the moves of a small world.
Christin Pawlovic published a proper statement
The Christian Paul’s declaration for the end of the mandate.
It results from him that PiS's lawyer gathered 110 thousand insurance.
Let us remember that Pawlovic said that the political department.
At the end of the mandate, the amount of 110 thousand evils
As it results from a declaration from the sentence, it receives the emeryture about me values 4.7 thousand evil.
Pawlovic has a residence of a value of 570 thousand evils and a little less than it is, getting 880 evil in the middle.
The sentence also invests in industrial metals, evaluating the investment for 150 thousand evils.
In the past, Jaroslav Kakinski also published the proper statement.
Votting over the interruption in acts for the time of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentaries voted against the three-day interruption in the Gmin Eby's works at the time of the Conservative Party's programme, what the Government was dealt with.
289 votes were reported, contrary to 306.
Usually, Emba Gmin does not work at the time of the party, so that they should not be rejected or participated in them or at the meetings of the Parliament.
However, the opposite parties believed that the Parliament should not interrupt the deal in such a key time as the last weeks before planned on 31 October of the United Kingdom outcome from the European Union.
A proposal for the Government for a break was 289 votes, against 306.
Two opposition parties already after conventions
No interruption agreement may be taken as a political degree of opposition to Prime Minister Boris Johnsoni for his decision to suspend Parliament for a week (the decision was recognised by the Court of Justice as an incompatible with the law and non-conformity) and that, after the judges decided, he does not want to apologize for it.
After that decision, Isba Gmin repeated the session, and the most important issue of the day was Johnson's occurrence and followed by her burst debate.
Johnson's opposite to the blocking of brexit and uni pre-terminal elections.
“The time was not time to perform brexit.
It must be performed to respect the result of the referendum.
Brexit must be hoped that we can take into consideration the priorities of the citizens, health service, the costs of life.
Brexit must be performed so we can unit this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party's Conference must be discussed in Manchester in the next Sunday and stayed in the midst of October 2th.
Conferences of two major groups of opposition – the Working Party and Liberal Democrats – have already occurred.
One of the justifiations that Johnson gave by explaining the so long stop of the parliament was just partial.

Who's Banas, and what has he committed?
The ship was deemed to make a journalist discovery in the matrimonial declarations of Marian Banasia.
We're going to consider another business that shoots the rulers.
The Supervisor TVN journalists have shown that Marian Banas, president of the Most High Control, during the last years, did not write to a 400 meters of a category, which is located on the Krakovy Mountain.
Moreover, his owner had in the mentioned rock of sexbiznes (and then take rooms for hours).

"Rechpopolita": Ignoring the order of the police will be punished
As the journal says, the decline of the order of a specific behaviour issued by the police must be a new type of excretion, threatened injury, arrest or restriction of freedom.
This change will be made by politicians.
The idea came to the Commission's Section on Petition.
"The matter is important, because there is more than half a million cases every year to the courts," we read.
The "Reschopopolita" determined that the Petition that the Individual Country of Policies writes to the staff on the change of the extent code has a chance to succeed.
Petition authors shall propose a new amendment to Article 54a of the Code of Exception.
He would like to say: “Whoever is not subject to the request or order of a public officer issued in the border and under the law shall be subject to the charge of arrest, injury or restriction of freedom.”
“Participation 3 of this Regulation refers to an identical charge for those who do not exercise orders, prevent or deteriorate the performance of the service activities” shall provide the journal.
Sociolog Andréi Kowalski said "Rezchopopolitei" that, despite the primary submission of the proposal, it is afraid that if it is implemented, it can be devoted to political manifestations.
"In the situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be little and rather than to lay down the situation, instead of warning it," adds.
The statistics provided by the journal show that 86 per cent of the citizens have positively evaluated the police interventions in 2018 and that they take 1,5 million interventions on the city each month.
Buras cares about Europe
Jachym Topol writes in blood.
In his fronts, there are editors, writers.
The father, Joseph Topol, was one of the highest warrior dramatics of cze, mentioned in one row with Vaclav Havlem.
So, after the beginning, Jachim has taken a lot of talents that he is trying to earn.
After eight years, he returned with the "Freeful Man".
The herds are Buras and Sonja, together with two sons, but not the typical Czech family.
They're actors, they're traveling to Europe.
He's a lover of Szekspir and a ship, she's a single face that doesn't stand out with a wine bottle.
One of the boys from birth did not give a sound from himself, and for the second time, he stayed at the time of the little ones.
But they're not the heirs in this story.
Everyone is just a background to handle the world where there is no space for artificial carriers.
It's the world of the inflammated provincy, the cohesion of old, suspicious people, and the divorced youth.
The "faithful man" is replaced by places in a absurd teatry.
The Narration imitates the didaskalia, and the talks of heritage create this world.
The scene is a full concern for its future, but also for unusual questions about the past.
Entity: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 aircraft due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy

Nearly 40 thousand people had to go with the office to the end of the year.

However, the company's problems have grown since a few years, which was a long effect of 1,6 billion pounds.

Girlit in Germany offers free accommodation for opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for opinions – such an unfortunate offer was prepared for the future of German Görlitz.
Actions have to help fight with the falling of the number of cities.
It's the most removed to the east city of Germany.
A nice pastle shepherd comes to 140 thousand tours annually.
However, as the “The Guardian” says, the city has a significant problem.
The most lowest in Germany is in Görlitz.
The city also wins the permanent residence of the people.
After the wall of the Berlin wall in 1989, most of them went to the west of the country, which was transferred to the population of the city about 25 per cent.
In 2013, it took 54 thousand people.
In order to fight delicately, the officers fell on the idea to start offering free salaries in the city.
Until the program has been influenced by 150 proposals.
Two thirds of them laid down the inhabitants of large cities.
The programme was also interested in people from Hungary, Czech, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to go to Görlitz," said one of the participants of the project.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven free apartments, and the freedom is three times than the average in the country.
Although the town authorities hope that some of them are going to stand up, the main goal of the programme is to get the opinion of the participants.
The information collected from outputs and teachers must help to live in smaller German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need, and they decide to carry out what their motivation was," Robert Knippschild was responsible for the program.
Other cities have already experimented with the ideas of getting new inhabitants, offering them encouragement in the form of accommodation.
The first of them was Detroit, which introduced a program for the promising young specialists to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, these are solved in many places, from the Greek Antikythera Island after Candel, Italy, or in the United States of Oclahoma.
