28-year-old kitchen found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old kitchen, which was recently made to San Francisco, was found to be dead in a local house of purchase.
The brother of the victim said he could not imagine anyone who would like to hurt him, "It finally went back to him."
The body found in Westfield Mall in midweek was identified by the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the Medical Division in San Francisco.
The Department of San Francisco Police said the death was killed and the investigations were undertaken.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, shared the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco with that Frank, who had previously been cooked in Boston, had made his dream job as a cook in the Sons & Daughtersaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and shocked on the ground."
"We're a small team that is like a deep family and we'll miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and cohesions are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia indicated that Frank lived in Hostels, but that, "the things finally went up for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a friend," shared Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to hurt the younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His way of connecting to his family was to always cook us something to prepare us the dinner," Louis Gallicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of exemption.
He was the brother who was weakening the power.
"For all that is running in the world, he was this unleavened diamond that lighted every day," he said.
Everyone with information about the case will be requested to call the SFPD's phone under 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'll always be cut in shooting
Jennifer Aniston must not always be perfect or perfect.
This has made the Hollywood Star clear in an interview now unexpectedly.
"I'll always be cut into shooting or get up from outer label, which mostly have little to do with me and the reality."
"I don't want to be perfect and perfect."
"Really, these things are better to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about it as "Mus Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The most loved player is to pass their time home, forming televisions with locker dust and mexican food, it is in the magazine.
"We must not be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In its new movie "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" is Aniston to see as a mother of two sons all tracting.
The film runs with us from 25 August.
Golfer Longer gets the sport piramide
His experiences on the horse are overviewable.
At the end of a golfturner in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little difference with an outset on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premier.
CHIO: "Goldne Sport Piramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses were reminded of their feedingstuff, and they followed in the fast gap home to the feeds.
A kilometer at this time, I've gone.
"It wasn't experience," says Langer.
And that's what the loopcar ended again.
On Saturday, Germany was the best golfer all times - 101 tourniers - again near horses.
He and his family led over the installation of the ALRV, on a horse, he didn't even weaken to photos.
More longer was the first time in Aachen and that was also in the CHIO.
The reason was convinced.
The German sports aid delivered the man from houses within a small gala to the golden sport piramide.
It doesn't miss the sympathic sporter.
Bundesver Service Cruz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already shared him.
More long is the 18th pricemaker of the sport piramide.
In Aachen, he met the first pricemaker Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This expression means me very much," says Langer, "want it will be forgiven not only for sports success, but also for social commitment."
Since years, longer promotes the adults.
And thus he also gave the price payment of EUR 25,000.
With 15 more exciting sporters, the U.S. Masters were twofold on Saturday in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports".
The exhibitors belong to the light athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the feet of Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring Rider Alwin Schock Meal and the posthum of the handballer Erhard wonderful.
Some of these sports members came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustre society returned to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza price was running.
Bernhard Langer kept away from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that wants both Clinton and Trump.
However, the two US presidential applicants are in tax and energy policy and in a principle.
The difference in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, highly philosophical distinction.
The one, over the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep it more small in doubt and warns how the State can damage the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants the economy to kill and to regulate death, he says.
However, he would be very different, claimed Trump.
He will resume massive regulations and make it strong for a broadly tax reform with lower tax rates - for owners and for companies.
However, Clinton says: The State has taken certain tasks, he has given opportunities to open and give money to it.
Therefore, the taxes for the rich would have increased, she said.
Interestingly, both are very close to the infrastructure issue.
Trump and Clinton are almost likely to be invested in the muscles.
The Democratic applicant has noted the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic and are strictly rejected by the state critical teaparty flights of the Republic.
Thus, on Trump, there could be still internally discussed discussions.
The subsequences of energy and climate policies are more fair.
Trump wants to build coal powers and resume cold promotion into the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in areas which have been exposed to the Paris climate protection agreement.
However, Clinton, with its investment programme, wants expressly to build the renewable energy and calls: "A country will be the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"I think it'll be China, Germany or America -- I want us to be."
However, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the transpasive trade agreement, does not want both to be undertaken.
At the same time, but the United States do not want to isolate from the international trade - but simply make a better job.
They should be paid better, as well as Clinton.
The current minimum loan of $7.25 is a hunger.
He wants to raise her up to 15 hours per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not completely clear: Once he says, the minimum loan must be taken up, then he says he must not be changed.
However, the great debate in the coming months should be better developed about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump is going to deploy the economy and the citizens to cover growth.
His criticians believe that he is in order that the budget should be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the riches to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution.
Flight: "Every worst woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who fly alone, almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a big kitchen.
Everyone has a baby, which is at least one year old.
One put her little son in his arm.
He looks with great eyes newly in the room.
His mother looks at the table.
Until she realizes she's watched.
She's laughing soon and kissing the kids.
The scene is normal.
Until you're talking to Katrin Bahr.
She is a regional business leader of Condrobis, a traveler for social assistance offers in Bayern, and inter alia works with the subject of women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the North Mounchner in one of the few decentral accommodations for single-founded women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobis took up the establishment with Pro Familia and the Münchner women assistance.
It was recently opened or opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There's no men - not even as a supper.
The exception is a guardian at the door.
"It's not translated to say, "Every woman who comes here has made her flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr.
"Man flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are tortured or death, or because their families sent them as a hopeman to Europe," she said.
In women, other reasons for fleeing are overwhelmed: "Multiers steal secretly because they don't see any other way."
In their home they have made experience with sexual violence, victory, honest death, slavery or prostitution.
Three of them continue.
It's going to go on the flight.
"The slepper, for example, requests a sexual action for a flash water, is not a rareness," says Bahr.
And women are alone, they will not be slaughtered by their families.
Whoever believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, tells Bahr.
Moreover, only women in refugee communities would often be considered as minor and injured at least.
This leads to traumatising about 90% of women living in the North Münchner.
"Some of the children have certainly not been voluntary."
Women were so habitually that they didn't say anything.
Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too large.
Since she often didn't know how to help, she needs more accommodations only for her, Barr requests.
In Bayern, the seven district governments are responsible for the delivery of refugees.
The question if they knew of a similar project as in monkeys in their field of competence, some answer no.
In the surfaces and surfaces, there is no such thing in governments' subconsciences.
Even in swimming women are not subjected only, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Presse speaker of the Government.
In surbayers, sub- and medium-sized farms, there are in some community businesses or homes only for single women and their children.
The exception is Nederbayern, there are two central meetings outside for women.
In the European Parliament, the Committee on the Rights of the Women and the Equality of the Seminars calls for women to be undertaken by men.
In a position published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be protected."
"If men and women are invoked together, it can come to - increasingly - violence against women."
In particular, weakening rooms should be easily accessible for women.
How much women expect this protection need, you can write to Andrang that is on the house in München.
"Despite speaking that we have, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You can easily open a second house.
Assistants: Requirements for new workshops
Assistance officers have invited their association to approve new working fightings in their conflicts with regard to a new Treaty.
The Juneor Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Propertyation (BMA) has requested his entire Council to authorize more work fightings since the beginning of September.
The JDC claimed that the Minister would have dismissed to enter into the concerns of the Treaty.
In July, assistant and medical students agreed on the delay of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted on elections.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the President of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the Government would remain "duely hard" to problems, which resulted in rejecting the Treaty.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC has agreed to reject the proposed new Treaty fully and requests of new negotiations for all your concerns."
As a response to the government's weakness, JDC's proposal today has made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of work fighting at the beginning of September.
The conflicts resulted in six times this year, the first total events in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA assistant Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the choice to deal with the agreements recommended by the BMA.
He shared the BMA members during the meetings, which were still in place before voting by 54.000 assistants and medical students, with the adoption of the Treaty.
After voting, Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty for Medicines in England would be introduced urgently.
Russia and Turkey: A "Alliance of Foreigners"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Thursday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight months of the war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposers in the refrigerated salon of St. Petersburger Palastes, I can't deceive the impression that Ankara wants this exhibition mostly.
There was the handboat, yeah.
But Putin's laughs worked smally and he stretched a little warm, even for his retaining conditions.
Recept Tayyip Erdogan went down again by "loyal friend" Putin - says a report for five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that the relationships with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improved.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have assumed that something bad would never happen.
I looked like his enthusiasm was to determine the opposite.
But one of Putin's exciting, sustainable coal showed that the Governing Boss of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Moreover, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction: the release of a Russian campaign at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow reaction at the time was wounded.
Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall Russia back.
The past was even greater, since it was done by a disgusting friend.
Weather rebuilding is difficult if it is not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has walked since November.
For months, the state-controlled media have made a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
Once it seemed as if the Turks were the guilty for everything.
In the most serious case, the accusations of leading officers were that Erdogan's own family would benefit from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the islamic state.
He has done this very hardly.
But in St.Petersburg the official message sounded that it was time to look forward.
This meeting was only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to buy a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a weapon station are clear.
Erdogan first needs all friends that he can get after his last month at a disappeared state street of his office almost dismissed.
Repetitive terrorist attacks on Turkey have also supported him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring millions of Russian tourists every year to the Turkish coast.
The number has fallen around 90%.
In Russia, travellers and charter companies will be easier when the flights are recovered.
They are counting on a later aisonale anesture at the Mediterranean.
This week was prognozed by the state TV of billiged fruit and vegetables, where the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemati stated: "Tourists are there long, tomates here long."
But the chairman had a common political value for Moscow.
Ankara is on the western whee, since it considers its response to the requested power overtake as a weak answer.
This is the persistent role of the EU access negotiations and Putin, which is encouraging to benefit from the cold vote and to reduce the relation of Turkey to the western.
The Russian State Boss in Ankara wins a bonus in order to request support for the selected State agencies according to the requested State aid.
This is evident for Moscow, a self-conscience that even has a deep seat before regime changes.
The meeting in this lucky palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an analytical "Alliance of External Sites" as two countries who feel the west and feel badly treated and are now connected.
Yet, despite the public exposure, there are still great differences between both.
The greatest difference is where Moscow has recently been the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey are subject to other sides.
It may be urgent that after almost three hours at the first talks both presidents at the press conference, they would not even have signed the subject.
The President of Turkey avoided replying to a question of their differences, while Putin dismissed them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found.
But after months of open enemies - and faced the potential for a perfect disaster, when the NATO-Mitglied Turkey abschosed the Russian battle - it is certainly better that the two government leaders at least again talk to each other.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The RBS mark is to be reduced by the Bank's representative only to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the RBS marks were connected to the global ambitions of the bank.
Since eight years ago, the Bank has been distorted when it has to be almost collapsed and rescued.
At this time, marking strategy "RBS" has been used to make other end consumer finance marks.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds to sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Sieger Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to reject more national marks in the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentral main seat and the bridge notation to NatWest will be changed.
The Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and North Ireland.
There are other smaller marks for the skills that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's military bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a survey tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He shared the BBC Scotland with: "The RSB mark will be to our investors mark and to the mark under which our employees will be employed, since we will now become more to a market bank."
When the bank himself became a global mark, the RBS became a global mark.
Now I say we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these marks will be in their own communities for something else perfect and our workers will work under these marks with the customers.
RBS has already said that his six-National Sponsoring will no longer continue and that it will increase the probability of the different marks in sport-sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop to the Marks Bank, because how can we get inside (we've asked) to do this to a better customer bank?" said the chairman.
It would have been very cyclical three years ago if we had said that we would be a good bank for our customers and would have launched these marks.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you'll see many changes.
We can restart these marks, so I think the time is coming.
Frankie Dettori reached its 3000 wins at Newmarket
Dettori shoots champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings 3000 wins to him
Jockey Frankie Dettori assured his 3000 British winning on Friday at Newmarket.
He set a pre-lection trained by John Gosden on his local ring streak with second winning of the night a milenstein.
The 45-year Italian is the sixth Jockey, which reaches the milenstein in the floor.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Dougith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dector who wined in Ghayar said, "It's something good."
I'm very emotional because my family is here.
I'm very happy that it happened in Newmarket because I've been born here for 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 200,000 people.
I'm easier and very humble.
Detori takes the jubel when he takes the vengeance on predilection
Two Jockeys reached the Milenstein in the barriers - Jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-small winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4.300 wins in a recording car.
Lester Piggott, who had nine-minded derbysians 4.493 Karéesiege
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the moderns and it is not surprised that he has reached this milenstein, which has just reached a few before him.
He has a style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellectual that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic newsman for running, his enthusiasm and Charisma enjoyed Fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6.000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournyerjockey!
Frankie has already run about 30 years of winners in GB, which is beautiful.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British round, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the Milenstein with a typical flight dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the exhibition of the British Flash River since two years.
It was nervous.
A whole range of big tournament wins, his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a flight abuse and had a prohibition.
Three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed a impressive characteristic strength to despise his doubles and return to his best form.
And he's not long at the end - Dector said before that he wanted to continue in competition until at least 50th year of life.
Russian Putin Febschef Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his officer Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the most confidential circle of Putin for many years.
The 63-year agency was appointed as a special officer for environmental and transport matters.
In a opinion of the Kreml, Putin, without indication of reasons, "the release of Ivanovs from his obligations as the president of the Russian Presidential Administration".
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's officer since 2012, was called followers.
Vano, 44, is a former diplomat.
In 1972, he was born in the Estonia's capital Tallinn, he concluded the renamed Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and ↓e in the message in Tokyo.
On the Kreml website it is (in Russia) that he was later the head of the register and head of the Government staff.
About his name he said to Putin: "This is for your trust."
I think it is the main task of the Government to undertake your activities as a Government's head of law and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin shared the Russian TV Sender on Friday that Ivanov requested to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his followers.
Do you convince the laughing faces?
This step has made Moscow secrets.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time for one of the most trusted Vladimir Putins and 日 for the Soviet secret service, KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men of the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was stretched in television, both men claimed that the boss returned to his own desire.
But despite the laughing for the cameras, there are only few convinced that, especially now, shortly before Parliament's elections.
So here is the result of a kind of power fight?
No one knows that now.
But the official appointment - that a man, who was approved as a potential president, wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy once again - was on a great scepsia.
In his comments on Putin, quoted on the creml site, Ivanov said "is true that I have asked you in an appointment in 2012 to trust me these very complicated posts - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
I have been president of the Russian presidential administration since four years and eight months ago.
Ivanov adopted the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was President of the Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin formerly member of the KGB State Safety Service.
In the latest 1990s, Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to officers.
As Putin obtained power, he called Ivanov as one of the five people whom he trusted in most of them.
On the other hand, Ivanov could be president of Russia after Putin's second official period, since a period of office Putins would have dismissed the Constitution.
But these posts were taken by another, nearby United States Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became the President before he returned to the President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson eures after he struck products
Gibson was assigned to a corporate exhibition at the seat of the series in Los Angeles.
ABCées and CBS Televisions, producing the series, announced their announcement in a common opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hoøjner, excused himself on Thursday before his announcement.
In Seth, there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I'm proud of the case," he said in a message.
The details of how the Gibson character is published from the series followed by a FBI agent team will be published at a later time, according to the opinion of the ABC日os and CBS Television.
The 54-year-old playing in Sitcom Dharma & Greg was with the first staff of the series in 2005.
"I love criminal Minds and I have entered my whole heart blood in the past 12 years," said Gibson in a publicationd message on Friday.
I had hoped to be at the end of it, but it will not be possible anymore.
I would just like to thank myself with the authors, producers, showers, our wonderful crew, and especially the best fans you can only want for a series.
The planned emission of the twelve staff shall be used on 28 September.
Assessment for fish landing in jardins in Banff
An inhabitant of Banff invited the fishing assistance to be performed inside the garden of Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 sandal fish could be exposed from a spring source.
Mr. Bain, who approximately 500 meters from the Sea le日, published on Periscope a video of the speech in the hope that someone could put a light on the appearance of the two tonnes of long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bry now connected to fife
The £ 1,35 billion tender project will be completed until May 2017
Engineers have connected the north cock of Queensferry Crossings to the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four exhibitions of the "decked blades", which draw close to each of the three doors of the bridges.
The brain section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weights 30,000 tonnes.
He split over 100,000 tonnes of steel and 200,000 tons of Beton and 46 stairs.
The £ 1,35 billion tender project will be completed until May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown has made the building today a cluster and was one of the first ones that went from the country to the bridges.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a real episode in this project with more than 30,000 tons of beton and steel used only for this part of the bridges.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the viadukt and the breach end is a heavy activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passion.
In total, almost 79% of the whole bridge end in their place and the last section of the deck today gets a betonus for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be thrown on the bridge at his place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Brie, Constructors said: "The first closure is a significant milenstein for each draft.
This fantastic project represents the closure of future high and deep buildings.
After the installation of the last road depth and its connection to the northern turm cover in the building, we had to close the still existing lamps on the north or country side.
This has been reached by dragging the northern supplier bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very heavy activity.
Massiv, since the viadukt is 222 metres long, about 6.000 tonnes weight and must be thrown up in an increase of approximately 3 %.
Hekel, since the tolerants to which the team was winning - on each side they only struggle a few millimeters.
Happy, everything was very good.
Rescue in the Moelfree Bay: Three men have "lucky to be still in life"
Three men have "lucky to be still alive" after they were made by their fisherboat beforelesey.
The Moelfree RNLI Saving Station shot on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their ship was moved from their own power.
"We saw the boat turning around her and presenting us the worst," said the leader of Moelfree Vince Jones' salvation station.
"Freely, the strong winds have already weakened the ship outside their ritual west until we left water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the man was created at age of 60 and was found on a boat with no salvation western.
They all came to the board of the coast ship and were brought back to the salvation station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were put into water have happiness to be unleavened and still alive.
Although the boot engine was over a not-stopplein, however, it solved himself at the centre of the boat from the person who managed the ship.
Someone has waited for these men today.
Severe damage - man approaches his ex-friend
A man attacked his ex-friend in Hamburg-Harburg with a meat and harshly hurt.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead of this, the alcoholized teasers are mixed by the clothes of his ex-friend.
When this came to the apartment, he arose on them twice.
The 44-year-old was hurt on the hand and on the body.
The police was able to catch the tattoo.
When the 50-year-old was clothing his ex-friend, he called his mother.
She warned her sister.
Along with her friends of life, the 45-year-olds wanted to strengthen their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her lifemates.
On the street, they met the ex-life companion of the man.
When the two women reacted to the apartment, the 50 - year - old sister shot his sister on the side and attacked her ex-friend.
Who builds Braunschweig's enjoyable apartments?
The SPDs and Green think that investors must be binding in the obligation to be more stronger.
How do you respond to the bad message that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 enjoyable apartments in the next years?
The SPD proposes to the next Council meeting a "Administrational concept of residence".
But the fight is planned.
First of all, the question is: Who will build the favorable apartments?
A scheme is missing until now.
Christoph Bratmann, President of the SPD Fraction, says: "We agree with the Green: Whoever wants to build on the state areas must show 20 pro of all apartments as social apartments."
However, the favourable apartments can also be found in the stock.
However, the great fighting point in Rathaus is, as Bratmann said, "What are you doing with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10% on such areas, but at least 20% of the apartments as social apartments."
A new state-based building programme, which will be costed and need to be financed, should be provided for encouragements.
The problem, such as Bratmann, "There is no agreement between the groups yet."
The CDU wants investors to make a few rules as soon as possible.
The Links wants to be broken for investors.
Unless regarding that, so Bratmann, the situation is distorted on the apartment.
If the action concept is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the building management.
More staff are needed.
It's unexpected whether we'll get the experts.
However, the programme is not completely: for about 1260 new apartments that should be built without it.
How, though, is the loss of more about 1300 favorable apartments that will be helped in the next years?
Only until 2020, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, as the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm, the town should now be acquired of exiting connections.
✔ It should be followed to get apartments back to the price binding.
This is possible in the West City.
On a shock, the problem was resolved.
Because in the West City they run to the annual terms.
During 1800 apartments, you could get back to the price binding for enjoyable apartments.
Only: It doesn't want the owners, the building companies.
Because the number of social apartments in the West City will be drasticly increased, it will be removed from the aim of the so-called mixture.
A concurrence of social weaknesses in only few cities should not be anymore.
The Green considers that there will be still a move in the debate.
Group President Holger Herlitschke says, "For a wide majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
Even though they could build on more buildings for infancy houses.
But it doesn't mean that a compromise can't be found yet.
Pokemon Go, a jail for health and happiness that rewards
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
That teenagers and children are not going out to play, but much more prefer to carry out their free time to watch on screens in the last year, it was accused of many.
In Pokemon Go, it is to leave people from the sofa and become more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV viewer, then on video games and recently on artphones.
Therefore, it is awesome to see that technology and Actions are not excluded in freedom.
I am obviously concerned about the Pokemon Go-Wahn, an applet on the characters that were created before for video games in the 1990s (after there was a series of characteristics, game cards and other spinners).
How many phénomènes of the Popkulture were interested before the game was published in the United States, Property and New Zealand begin July.
The market introduction in other countries was moved by the massive request that the server overloaded.
In the midst of few days, Pokemon Go had more users than tinders and almost so many as Twitter.
How does it work?
Shortly said, players are going out with their artphones and search for pokemons followed by a GPS and, as soon as they were found, can be taken "foto" (with a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when she was still younger, fell on the shot and running for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that returned the "medium" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that follows 35.000 users, the Washington Post recently shared that within two days after the marketing of the game, the number of followed people who trained 30 minutes each day, was 45 Pro · to 53 Pro.
The company doesn't know who is playing Pokemon Go - it's just seeing the RAW data to increase the performance.
Public discovery campaigns for health, people want to take "so 30 minutes of time", "to come to sofa" and "to be active every day" put on baptism ears, because many public messages of health are long-term and come from people who look worried.
However, the importance of sport cannot be over-estimated.
Whoever regularly sports trees, reduces his chances to disturb cancer or depression.
Organic treatment helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to make them here.
But the wonderful of Pokemon Go is that it leads people to do something in freedom that makes them fun.
Three columns of health are therefore covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight and enjoyment.
Some people end up on the jail even new friendships.
Like always, there are married players who always need to be charged about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's going on?
It has been a break.
Even if artphone apps such as Fitbit had already been able to follow our A.A., they didn't give us any reason to train sports as this game does.
The new will lose his trip and the use will be left with time.
As a result of Pokemons success, however, there will be more games to join apps and reality with the activity in the real world and to help many people on the jail to be active, fitting and sinful.

Simone Biles creates gold in the Damenture
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is all the immune.
Dynamic on the sprung horse.
Unfortunately on the panel.
Atmosphere on the ground.
On the whole line.
And now, finally, the Olympics.
The 19-year-year-old tournerin revealed on Thursday the additional fighting title and increased the light between himself and the world in front of all eyes under the olympical games.
The total result of 62.1998 was clearly before the silver medical winner and the "Final Five" human cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze Media winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the swimming bar during the single sea campaign of women in the Olympical Sommers in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Billes is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a additional battle title and all the fifth, while she claims to be the best of their generation or even at all.
She was in trees when her final result was shown and her long travel at this moment ended.
This success represents it in the same Liga as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, which have brought her sports types to new heights:
Billes has dominated her sports art in the last three years, 15 worldmasters metals - > 10 gold medals - with such a wonderful practice that includes a mixture of honesty and precision that the Olympiaian of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best tourner that I have ever seen."
It expected her a last trial in Brazil, a competition that did not so much between the Biles and the athletes, but much more between her and a burden of overdimensionated expectations.
Not with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be viewed as a divorce.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, after they have won each gold and silver in the single maritime campaigns of women in the Olympical Sommer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Billes took the first medaille on Thursday, while she served as a vocational sign at the breakfast of the home co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Billes was about, while their long way on the top, never planned the future, it is not really true.
A part of their earthquake - which contains their typical tumbling pass - is agreed to Latin American music that would pass home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a case.
This girl, adopted by their grandparents as a child and discovered by Trainerin Aimee Boorman's mother during a school flight in the tournale, trained in the Boorman.
She has no longer lost additional bathroom competition since summer 2013, a serial that will stop as long as it wants Biles.
Even when Mustafina led easily through two rotations, drag the picture.
Sweet bars and bottles - where the cars hold the world master title.
She recovered with 15.433 on the swimming board and set up another 15.933 on the ground.
Raisman surrounded her very well when they expected her end - a pure formality - and trees flowed on the cars blue red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision that she had once described in her collective book was real.
The performance of Raismans was a race for the last time four years ago, when she struck the space, but the Bronzemedaille went in a Tiebrake in Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old community, called "Oma" Americans, had an advance.
After its earthquake, she gave to the public a cousin, overwhelmed by a comback that sometimes occurred doubtfully.
As regards Biles, the quick spreading twot of the 19th years from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial murder when listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the most deadly attacks since one year in the first case of Phoenix's death, while they interviewed and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter of Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entry, the authorities said.
The teater feed eight shots from a handwarm, while he stood on the side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, it is read in the report.
The police shared that the three-fold murder seemed not to have been the result of a raw accident, because the counterpart did not take the hands or $2.900, which were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt Jonathan Howard said that the shooter led the investigators to become a closer box on whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
In general, in Spanish residents, seven persons were killed within four months in nine attacks and two other victims.
"It happens in a residence before a house," shared Howard of the KHPO, a daughter company of CBS, the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the conscious has used several vehicles, a green nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and led by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and died later because of her damage.
Liner, 31th, and Ellis daughter Maleah died still in place.
A witness shared the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also publish a police report on the shooting that targeted a half hours before the three-fold murder, and that it was the work of the serial murderer.
Experts found patrons and secured a bowl from the seat and cow fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with a microsephalie: "It's gonna be better"
Like most of the 6 years of age, Edmund Pi日uto the song, players and, of course, his mother.
But as the least of his older ones, Edmund Microsephalie, the result of a genetic squeeking, about which his mother Elizabeth Pi月uto did not know anything during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first idea was, I didn't get it.
I can't do that.
That's what I didn't leave.
What's not right -- of course, you've been allowed to do it," she said.
Your husband and Vincent were told her that Edmund could never recognize her in circumstances and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutionalise him.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know that people were still doing,' said Pi日uto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund could not sit down or crab until the year of life, and he can't still speak.
But he makes quiet progress.
He can run with support and drive.
He also wants to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the characters, which Edmund has exposed for "Bitte sing something before me".
"We're bringing him a sign," said Pi日uto CBS News.
But it's not a typical character -- she says. Edmund found some signs alone.
Microsephalie has a number of causes: genetic as in Edmund and infections with virus such as mass or cycavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognoses can vary strongly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of the cikavirus In.
Pi日uto recalls the emotional price of an unknown future.
I always asked what would happen?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know it.
I have no longer asked for the prognose because I don't expect her to tell me someone really.
But Pi日uto has a hopeful advice for mothers of kids with births caused by the Zikavirus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain cases, overflowing provides opportunity to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Great rainfalls and greater overcomes in Louisiana are forced by the Governor to call the need on Friday. It will be calculated over the whole Saturday with more rainfalls.
Many rivers in the south - east Louisianas and the south of the Mississippis overflowed their villages and dropped with extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards shared that State officers are in constant contact with the local authorities and assisted to the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, shared that the requests for highwater vehicles, boats and sandshops were multiplied.
Steele said that only the Tangipahoa community would have requested thousands of sands.
A surface warning system is used over large parts of South Louisianas to Saturday.
The Weather Service allowed that in this area, 3 to 5 pounds could fall into rain.
In South Alabama, a flight warning system was used on Friday while it continued to rain in the mobile area.
The Fluss Committee at the nearby Baton Rouges and the Fluss Amite near Denham Springs, both of them in Louisiana, will reach all probabilities after the weekly recording speed.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both flights could overcome many houses in the predicted nearby Baton Rouge.
He also said that a streamwart-oriented survival in Ascension Parish represents a section, since these flows will only flow quietly into the Maurepas Lake.
The Fluss Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest position ever held on Friday at 09:00.
Rescue teams have still spent people from the flight water in the areas of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his son were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the water of Beaver Creek, which usually is remote of more than 400 feet from house, has grown strong over night.
He said he would have warned him another son of silver who lived nearly.
"We're wakened and the water stretched and stretched in," said Hansford.
It reached my size.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a stream level in the 48 years in which she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members had all obstacles and he was the only one who could wear.
Hansford said that the emergency helpers would have saved all three in a large military LKW and would have brought them to the next firewagen in Gloster, where they were undertaken until Friday.
Krautmann said that the survival had "expanded rapidly" because there were still serious rainfalls and that the authorities were taking into account evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a watchman reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday tomorrow of 13,75 tonnes of rain.
Krautmann said that the ground has been significantly completed through the rainfalls since the middle-week.
The authorities indicated that severe rain and road transmissions caused the salvation of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and educational accidents in five school districts.
The CBS daughter senter WWL reported that there was 200 overwhelming homes in Tangipahoa.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches that now have been overcome.
The chief of the assembly of Robby Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven households who were covered by the highwater.
In the towns of Amite and Hammond, newspapers were established to attend the evacuated.
"When the water begins to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town Hammond of the Tangipahoa community, nearly two thousand streets were closed on the basis of the highwater and provided sandshops for the residents who hoped to keep the water from their homes and businesses.
"The last big overcome we had was in the market," Lacy Landrum said from the city manager.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countis said that it continued to rain on the golf coast.
According to his information, a main householder should be reported on Thursday as overwhelming, but on Friday they have not been reported until now.
Keith Townson, Manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, le Â € 40 years ago in the area.
"I have seen water in places where I never saw it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "from bottles" overleague shooter in Philadelowe
The police shares that the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelia, this week already the second time a six-year-old child will be shot.
The elders of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelbia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents suggested that Brown had a number of shoes, in the boat, in the feet, in the arm, and in the bow, but he was at the transport to the hospital at the consciousness.
"His grandmother Delores Meldenz shared the sender.
I can't believe that.
The status of the boy was critical in a hospital, and he had to undertake several operations.
The child's family shared the sender that he would probably be cured again.
He should have started the first class in a local basic school.
Brown was one of four persons shot in Germantown.
Similarly, three men were shot: two in the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical state; the other two victims are said CBS Philadelia in stable state.
The boy was found at the president of a car together with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, reported by the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police just realized whether there could be one of the hurt men of the teasers.
Experts shared the CBS Philadelia that it seemed to have come to a crossfear between several scepters.
Patrons for storm weights that were followed to different storm weights have overseen the tatort.
It seems that it has been clearly to be an increasing battle.
On the street, on both sides of the road, there were streets.
So there seems to have given several armed fighters that were very actively shared," shared police hairman Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelowe to the sender.
There were also several houses and vehicles in the area.
There were no decisions and the police is currently checking reports according to the monitoring video.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old girl was met by a arm-master when she played before her house in the residence of West Oak Lane.
She's getting back, and the police's still looking for a contemporary.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I imagine under the women's olimpianship in the tour, and this is for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I have been with each sommerolympiade and the United States have never been so dominant.
And secondly, this community has three tourners, Simone Billes, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Hernandez, which were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this community, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish, and abrupt Madison Kocian, the Catholic, makes every surprise.
This community finally reflects the United States.
It has fed the black and Spanish women's presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one under the women's tourners was an afro-amer.
The last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the last olympical games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising olympical winner and America.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world master Simone Billes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but mostly loved Gymstic rutines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won in a individual multi-conflict event for women Gold.
Aly Raisman wins Silber.
We experience the top of this sport species, but this does not look like tour classs throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie shot all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the olympical team.
They are the "Latest five" because the next Olympia community will only have four tourners in the community. Â It's the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainerin.
But the reality seems that the tourns are a furious sport and turners are in the first line in private tours, which will be held by parents, which can continue for training, establishment, travelling, competition and hotels (for the tree and their tourners and families). The list can continue.
The majority of these tours are located in well-hashing forests that can undertake the business.
In these United States, the tourners receive their whole training, and this is a close and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer from Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they have started with the tour.
We need to enable the communities even innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to facilitate and easier tourning.
I've found my tournship for 20 years.
In my events, we have offered free and urgent tours in Harlem for more than 15.000 citizens (in particular black and spanish) and trained national and international victories.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality tours that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this beautiful olympical sports art.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, dissipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination provides long-term benefits for health as well as for educational and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this community that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the tournament and that's beautiful.
It's so important to share in sport, especially for girls.
That's a so tired time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" through the gain of the Olympical Family Gold and thanks, if so many young girls are motivated with different backgrounds to start their way, become healthy, strong and young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further streets after they have rejected Jeremy Hunts' proposal
The Ministers had hoped to end the fight against the changes by adopting a reformed Treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Property, but 58 Pro of the 37,000 assistants who voted on a choice rejected him.
In July, Hunt planned to introduce the contract urgently and said that the NHS was located in a "nobody" country and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful.
The first assistant will receive a new contract containing amendments to night and week work in order to improve the care of unbusting hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Assistant Committee last night, shared in a communication with: "Assistents have the proposed treaty to the proposed Treaty, in particular that it is stressed by the current statement crisis and will require it to treat all doctors right."
Only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty must be made progress and the time is running.
Efforts from the BMA to solve conflicts through interviews were to share the Government on the opposite and sometimes on the weakness of ears.
That happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made the last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, resume the force and respond to the concerns of the assistant."
If he doesn't do this, the assistant has made it clear that they are ready to make further work fightings.
The last streek end of April saw an exhibition of approximately 13.000 routine operations and 100.000 dates, since hospitals and experts were included to provide doctors on the streek post cover.
The Ministers had hoped to end the fight against the amendments by adopting the reformed Treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Handling.
The BMA wants a better weekly department for the 54,000 assistants to be undertaken to the Treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Workers, invited the assistant to end the stream.
Mortimer said, "The work fighting measures are not only a little but are charged by the already overbeared teams and services leaders and prepare the patients, the divorce and their families only concerns, pain and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of the Assistance Force and have answered positively with the Ministry of Health and other Ministers to think about the pre-much and whistleblowing.
The employees hoped that the continuing positive commitment to other important issues - such as sending, flexibility in schools, additional training for those who returned from a fair time, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational plan, training facilities and the generally specific payment cases in the medicine - were a sign for how serious it was the employer, health education in England and the Ministry of Health on the compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medication that can reduce the heart infarct risk
Thousands of heart infarct patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities recommended to leave this more people for a longer period.
The Remembering Medicinal Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repetitive heart incidence in persons with a heart disease.
The medicinal product has been administered for 12 months after a cardiac infarct, which reduces the risk of a slaughterfall or another heart infarct.
The regulatory NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year receipt to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The regulatory NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year receipt to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
140,000 people suffer a heart infarct every year and a fourth of it lead to another heart infarct or a slaughterfall.
Heart infarcts and sleegan cases are caused by collections of fat holding materials in the artificial walls that are designed.
If the plague turns out, it can cause a blood infection that stops the blood fluid to the heart and causes a heart infarct.
If the blood injection is l’, it can flow through the blood stream and hide the blood flow to the brain, which causes a slaughter accident.
Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to another risk.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British AstraZeneca and is exploded under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the education of blood insules unlikely.
The NICE guide design, published today, recommends a 12-month adoption of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a two-day adoption of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Evaluation area, said: "With the availability of secondary prevention, a fourth of those who have experienced a heart infarct, another heart infarct or a accident - often with desperate effects."
It may have significant negative effects on the life quality of a person before a renewable heart infection.
The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heart incidences and injuries in people who have already had a heart infection.
By a temporary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are glad that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficiency and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of blooding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guide is not recommended to be treated over this period.
Culture of the Political Correctness allows election in Muslim areas
The former citizen master of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the transmission of a government report on corruption from the office
A culture of the Political Correctness has led to a widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is evidently ignored as a devastating government report today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles takes the police, electoral observators and advisers to ignore the evidence of choice misuse due to "incompatience with Ethnie and Religion".
The former Ministry for Integration and Communal Government, who is now a King of Anticorruption, said that the ensuring of electors from religious motives would be so bad that the police should have been allowed to set off blocks out of election cabines to slay protected electors.
He recommends the electors to bring a statement with them to demonstrate their integrity in elections.
At the time, a chooser must only call his name and address.
The report proposes to put non-remote tends on the finger of a person when it gives their election to prevent someone chooses twice.
Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
He requests that the press should have more access to Community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only against election failure, but also to sße the communal government before the larger corruption and financial pollution culture that is involved in it," he said.
The report was assigned by the Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election Channel in East London.
Last year, a special election court was decided that the official citizen Lutfur Rahman after a Lithania should be rejected in corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The Court showed that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in cyclic way and that he would have made his critics with racism and islamophobia's accusations weak.
Rahman would "have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 voices were doubtful or the result of a follow-up, when one person was chosen other than someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of disturbance throughout the country.
He expressed himself particularly alarming towards the disturbing letter choice - in the elderly members of the Muslim community would have pressed people to choose a candidate of their election.
Sir Eric, imagined, made several recommendations to clean the election system, to the leader of demonstrations to demonstrate the efficiency
The report states: "If there were evidence that the pressure of some ethnic minorities was performed, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elders, especially the communities with Pakistan or Bangladesh background.
"There was a reminder that... State institutions had wisely ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" superficialities regarding ethni and religion."
Sir Eric expressed 50 recommendations to clean the system, to prohibit that political activists edit letter choices to stop "waveers".
The report that Theresa May has been recorded also requires stronger registration checks to prevent the use of the election list of immigration and social disorders.
Draw options to ask choosers before choosing your display.
Use non-remote tint on a person's finger as long as she has given her voice to prevent someone chooses twice.
Make systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limitation to requests to a automatic letter selection.
It prohibits political activists to edit full letter cars and exchanges of letter cars.
The police gives the ability to set up blocks for choice.
A amendment to facilitate an accusation of insurance in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Republication of the People Act of 1983).
Photography prohibited in Wahlst.
Request that only English can be used in the choice (excluding Wales).
Intensive training in order to ensure that the employees apply the rule that electors are going alone to the election cabin.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan police and finds it "excellent" that after the Tower Hamlet's case, there was no penalty.
"The election court explained Lutfur Rahman and his representative for a Lithania's cause of corrupt and illegal practices as unfairly," he said.
It was due to a number of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings - responsibility.
He also criticizes the ineffective "afact controls" of the election register sections of the Council Houses.
Sir Eric said, "The court in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as Parliament's mother, is a proud inheritance, but the concernful and covered spread of election fraud and lie of some authorities threatened this good call.

Thank you for.
The Chinese Swimerin Ai Yanhan, 14, weeps the second stage of the wheat staff 1:57,79 - 1,61 seconds lateer than Canada Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to lock the lamps to China.
Viewers in the entire Canada quickly responded online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane twice, "Has the CBC commenter just said that the 14-year-old whisper from China was dead?"??
The idiot doesn't understand that they were still on sending."

The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and heavy, while many talked to him
Twitter users didn't stay back when they heard how unsensibly Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #Byron MacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly afterward, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC sentence, lived for the comment of MacDonald and said, "We are sorry for the comment on a swimming force."
It was an unfortunately chosen formula, I'm sorry that it's been handled."
CBC apologize over 90 times at the end of the people who responded to the comment on Twitter
The commentary college Scott Russel had to apologize in the name of MacDonald
CBC copied and invoked his excuses in more than 90 other Twitter users who were accused of the comments of MacDonald
The network also was quickly excused and gave a message out.
We are promptly sustaining that these statements were made and that they were enabled to be extruded.
We apologize quickly last night at our viewers on sending and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments relate to the performance of the swimming and not to it as a person.
However, they were unconscious and an unfortunately selected formulation. Byron does what he said, very sorry.
On Thursday after midnight, MacDonald apologize in the sending and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to be expressed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I had made after the female olympics in the CBC Olympics extension, he said.
"I've been on the use of the swimming and not on them as a person."
Of course, no disappointment was observed, and I am so sorry."
Buyers in Primark are charged by women who are trying in the middle of the business without shamless subways
The purchasers didn't know where they should look when a woman went out their clothes in a prize to try underhose.
In order to hurt the situation, she had to look out of it, she went out and restored her to the rulership.
She continued and tried four subhoses in a business in Bouverie Place Incoops space in peoplestone,
The Primark Business in Bouverie Place Incoups room in Popestone, where the woman asked the underhose before she left her back to the regal
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried the underground, " she turned back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the marketing area, she took a couple of underhoses from the exhibition, threw out her own shops and horses and tried them.
"He didn't even try to find a little more discreet place to do it-- she just stood there, fresh like Oskar."

A speaker of Primark said, "Primark is aware of the event that occurred on Thursday, on 9 August, in our peoplestone."
All products in question were made from the sale.
How to get with Kκε Maga before weapons attacks
The world outside is an awesome place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it something more safe for you.
We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a grand master of Kκε Maga Verbandes in New York, to find out how to run with weapons to nearly distance with weapons.
Independent of whether you are close to you from front or behind, this video will show you how you turn your shooter.
If you approach you from behind, you should turn to first, so that you can see your chairman and "build you out of the shoes", Mizrachi says.
Then take the weapon between your front arm and your wallet before you shoot him with your free elbogen.
Then shoot him with the knee into the bed and turn away, while the guard is combined before pain, the weapons from his hands. Shoot him with the wall into his face and move back, while they put the weapons on him.
The technology is similar to those in front of the team - move your body out of the shot, take the weapons and turn them back, so the royal officer can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the weapon and switch the roof on the bridge, then turn the weapon outside Griff before they move back and put the weapon on it.
Sounds hard?
Look at the video to see exactly how it forms Mizrachi.
But remember that it's the most safe for a roof to give your money - if you're not a KCa Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright shooks his tongue for a traveler in the most deceased places of Europe
A British traveler submitted his immune system and wirgerflex to a serious test - by rejecting some of the most disturbable and famous places of Europe.
The Moderator and Traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, shaped his travels on a Euro-scain, a land at Piccadilly Circus, a shopping button and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistability of his immune system.
Before all objects were cut off, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he would be put on.
But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was some surprising results in the daylight.
The idea to cut off the button of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be absolutely abstract, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen powder.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical experts about the support of Darbacteria and his own health.
Happyly, he left nothing that he rejected, more than a bad deceit in his mouth.
Mr. Wright has been testing the opposition of his darm through his traveling through the world and his own and wonderful things.
From public lands at trains to to the tops of toilets, the task of his immune system definitively under a test
In the film he said, "I was relatively uninquired about my health and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and smokewater."
In the movie, he was justified in any case.
The only thing he refused was a wounding toilet in Russia.
His test range showed a number of Luminometers of more than 4000 units.
In comparison with this, the number of luminometers is freshly weakened hands less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to delay after its number of luminometers exceeded 4000 units, while freshly weakened hands show one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the road movie "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie he says, "This is the worst thing I've cut in a toilet near."
There's nothing more crazy than that!
I'm not going to do anything in here because it's fair here.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company refers to Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains milk acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to undermine the promotion of darbacteria and immune systems.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Business and New Category Niko-Renmaa said, "We really wanted to offer a new thing to the consumer.
Something is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We conducted foolish brainstormings that ended that we said, "Let us call Ian."
They claim that the interest in the health of darm health will be a global phenomenon
Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of freedom health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in the darm health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary film, we could provide more information to the consumer in a interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the region of the film, added: "Let me say that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had deceived some of the things I had commanded him to lift, like the famous Russian toilet shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to the laughing, and others, with which this was very difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these sorrowful leckeries on the movie."
In a survey carried out by Valio from 2015, 84% of all requested milk acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of magnes and darm and 58%, stated that they used at least occasionally products containing accessible milk acid bacteria.
Associal family resorted before deloging social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A associated family left her social apartment after a deloging with a damage of £500,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were subjected to a long list of complaints of their presence in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their presence, shocked staff of the apartment company found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls show lower walls up, wood deals were drawn up, Mâ was spread on the bottom of the foot, and the graffiti was mixed on the walls.
The family has been broken and it is assumed that it is now in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, who for the house manager at Cornwall Housing, said she cared that the apartment was not to be restored anymore.
She said, "It was a absolute albumry for people here, and I think people don't need to live in this way.
There are many things to be considered, since this presence is probably not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is based on it, and her call is also.
The couple had three sons who lived intermediately in the apartment and the police said that the terror, which had been assigned to the family, included streets fights with baseball travellers, hosts of residents, disturbances, trafficking and excessive crying, fights and flights.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the contract, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which will be cut in circumstances, old was found
It was in the presence in which the wood parts were treated in the past
Neighbors said they looked at them on the street and had to be called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partners this week violently from the present after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.
The deloging was pleased by easier neighbors who said that their life was made for hae.
One said, "They're not too much."
We lived 20 years near them, and it was always bad.
The innumerable times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Tomorrow we couldn't sleep."
We arose because it was so hard here - that's not usual!
Now where they're finally gone, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have committed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police was called regularly for 20 years
On the overwhelming side of the community house, Mâ and old games were undergone
He adds:"It's a shame that the citizen's dismissed, every responsibility for her behavior and her family, because a delogation is always the last step that the Cornwall Housing takes into account.
That was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extremely and their actions were to be terriblely viewed for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as the members of the community, who have deeply accessed to us and allowed us to get the information.
I hope that this development will be comforted by some neighbors and gives the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but they were all over 20.
A wormful matrix left in one of the sleep rooms of the house after deloging on the ground
Workers of the house manager will now need to space Mâmbers that surround the house
2014, the police carried a race in the house and found more than 70 g Cannabis and Waagen, Paraphernalia and Barry payment of £700.
Skeldon received a money penalty after she had a responsibility for the possession of a drug of class B in trade.
She claimed that the money for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, which came to a car accident in 2013.
After they were without obdach, Tanya and her partner will now live in a private apartment in Plymouth.
Room walls of the house were shaded with Graffiti.
The police says she's going to deloge a member who doesn't keep on the household rule.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall's police shared that deloging is a clear warning to the other members who do not follow the household rule.
"This is for those who think that they can take themselves without self-sufficiency, and for those who were charged by such a behavior," she said.
The Police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviors that will continue to cooperate with partners to break our communities.

Donald Trump runs ′′ powerful problems in the choice fight
The leaders of the United States are increased by massive concerns, including in traditional conservative States of the United States.
The presidential candidate Donald Trump now gave the weakness of his election campaign in the present Republic of Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the multimillioner, usually great and self-certain, expressed something like thoughts, as the correspondents reported.
After he has made 16 rivals inside his own Republican camps out of the round, the doubts are now growing in success in the battle around the White House.
"We have a lot of problems in Utah," Trump said before evangelical Christians who he asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
If he was guilty of false reports about his candidate, he took his medium sheet again.
Republican Hochburgen wakchling
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a question from SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitiveness of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same side.
Other institutions see Trump before, however, not with the distance of the Republican candidates in the Federal State.
It also applies to Arõna and Georgia.
In an interview of the Sender CNBC, the Trump answered the question how he wanted to stop the forest Clintons again, "When, as I did until now."
And the back: this will be "or be," or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation.
He does nothing else but "to tell the truth".
If it doesn't be rich for him at the end of political correction, if it's okay, Trump continued.
Then I'll return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Partie should have threatened Trump to put money to support its election fight, it should not be able to present better investigation values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress will want to be stronger under the arms.
Olympia: Triister disorder at Do-Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenia's light athletes travel after the second Do® business at the Olympics games in Rio de Janeiro Ungeach.
After a trial of disturbance at a do-control in the Olympics village, Kenia sent a tra's home.
The International Olympical Committee shared in establishing immediately a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Chinese functionary had notified that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village, had issued an urin test under the name of the 800-meter driver Ferguson Rotich.
This is the Team Leader Kenias reported by the DoÂ controllers.
The IAAF worldwide association requested the IOC information on the case to enhance own investigations, and a IAAF speaker shared.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, IAAF will take an evaluation," it said in a IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to Do ́ control station and has been issued as Ferguson Rotich, tested and signed," Kenia's Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the atlete, which was on the list of training controls of the World Anti-Do Agency.
Ferguson Rotich became more than 800 meters in Peking WM.
Four days ago, the Chinese Leichtathletic Delegation Chief Michael Rotich was removed from the Rio Games.
He must have informed his country's Sportler's money payments about the existing Do-Tests.
According to media reports, he must have been established at the airport of Nairobi at his back.
Kenia has been under special observation in the IOC after a number of Do-Transports since longer.
In the announcement of more than 2000 Do Objective Controls before the Rio games, it was unusually noted that special atletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into visa.
The World Anti Do Agency had a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-do-law and a functioning control system.
The law has been dismissed a few weeks before the beginning of Olympia.
As a result, the WADA Kenia took the list of countries whose controls are in accordance with the rules of WADA.
Kenia applies as a large Lücher nation.
The light athletes of the country won most medals at the WM 2015 in Peking.
In a series of ARD television reports, it has always been suggested that there is easy to be accessible in Kenia Do > center and that there should be a significant mentality of sports disturbance.
IOC-Mitglied Richard Pound requested a similar investigation in Kenia, as he made it in the Russian light athletic.
It could be demonstrated that this sport type was broken and systematicly baptized.
Russian light athletes were thus excluded from the sommer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburger Festival games present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic loving couple, like Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical reobbeds Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's Masterwork.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the music into the temple of the classics and fulfilled the role of Mary’s youth dream.
In the orchester grave, the Simón Bolívar Orchester under the leadership of the Venezonal Director Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of Rhythmus," he warms.
We always say it is very latin American.
There are many Latin American suits in their time and their melodie.
It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recept for our orchester.
I would say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this inscenation, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She reminds her love with Tony, while the youngest Mary is playing and dancing.
Mary's role has always fascinated me.
First, because she's musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very suffering.
"You like me very, my Italian character, which I have as Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the oper singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such a honour to work with us with her.
She's an unhealthing man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment, "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very triumph!"
Direction is a need for him.
You see it in every movement, in his chair, it's his life!
It's a big chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have an earlier southern temperament, a fire, a suffering, and a happy approach to life, which is very important!
For the Roman Governor Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" high-actual: "In this part it's about prejudices and fanatism."
Today, we have the refugees, then the Portorialians went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
They are the same subjects, and they are today as exhaustive as at that time.
59 years later, the track is still relevant.
London Schoolmade, who joined the IS, was killed in †en

Reid says Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of a choice in Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential agenda of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's activity since his nomination by Barack Obama in the market.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McCon日 believes that the next president will call the follower of the dead judge at the Master Court of Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a phone conference that he expected Garland to choose "with a certain measure of conscience".
A speaker of Reid later said he hadn't yet spoken with Clinton if she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't take care of injury with a new candidate.
Garland is the main judge for the US Appeal Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that the Republicans blocked the Garland Nomination, such as Lakaien and assistant of the Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump.
He also concluded that Donald Trump was inappropriate to the President's office.
Treats wants naked calendar for "women and men"
The Treats Magazin → with the photograph David Bellemere to produce a 1970-yearly inspired Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The Chef of Treats Steve Shaw told us the beginning of this year that his naked magazine was different from Oldschool Playboys, since "Playboy for men".
I'm doing this for women.
It seems that he thinks that the calendar is doing it too.
"We must return to the presentation of an untimely and classic nakedness, where both women and men are still feeling inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press communication on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful artwork.
Models can access their images online or personally at open Casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community calculates mass flight
"Whoever doesn't adapt and Erdogan lamentates, sits on packed coffees," says the president of the Gulden-Nearby Station Dialog and World, Ercan Kar日yun.
The Kurdish community of Germany recalls shortly with thousands of protectors who fled from Turkey to Germany.
In the meantime, it could even be "a hundred thousand", believes the chairman Ali Toprak.
The Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan, after the putsch trial, expects the Kurdish community of Germany to flee to Germany.
"I consider shortly with thousands, medium-termly with some hundred thousand protectors from Turkey in Germany when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Foreign President Ali Toprak of "Welt" on Friday.
Since the Government has already been in Kurdish Hochburgs for months ago, 500,000 Kurden were in Turkey to flee.
After the rubbered putch, the rubbers still adds s­ulary and oppositional ethnic turkeys.
In Europe, they will be restarted if they continue to be undertaken in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes refugees himself produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak.
The defense manager complained the goal of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Albanian cities.
This is how Erdogan wants to increase the output pressure on the remaining curds.
"You are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greece have already been destroyed or destroyed in the past hundreds of years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The Defense Boss requested that the Federal Government "so low as Austria against Erdogan and his attachers".
Also in Germany, there is a "Hexenjagd" against Erdogan criticist.
I don't feel safe in Germany in the last months.
The German border of the Gulen Motion also protects the fleeting of many Turks to foreign.
More Turks will look for Asyl in Germany, especially Kurden and Oppositional.
The brand marking as gilean attachers destroys teachers and other academics the famous existence.
"Whoever doesn't adapt and Erdogan lamentates, sits on packed coffees, and also the kemalists and süllulars," Ercan Kar日yun, president of the Gulden-Nearby Station Dialog and Education, said "Welt".
As reported by the report on numbers of the Federal Ministry, Turkey has already set before Putsch the largest group of asylum authors recognised for political persecution in Germany.
On Thursday 30 June, this was 11,386 people, and so almost 29% of all were asylum-appreciated recognized (39.625).
This highlight does not find refugees before war, poverty or inspectiveness.
Asylum rights in accordance with the basic law are political, so by State side, individual persecutors.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it is bad"
Wonderful Mecklenburg Prepommers: The homes do not receive anything from the Sommer election battle with - and the northern Rhein westfalens will not be able to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg's predominants, they understanded.
2021, the country's choice will not be replaced directly at the end of the summer festivals, and the Parliament has already concluded the beginning of the year.
Because there's no blacker than so far: the summer, the hot and the country's choice - that's the way.
The homes to be convinced by the electoral officers are in the vacation.
The most vacants that are in the country are on Usedom, Rounds or Hiddensee on the road are not homeless, so they cannot choose the landday.
It comes to practical problems: In the flights, there are helpers to join the places, to flash airballons, to distribute flights and to count voices at the end, just to slow up.
By 4 September 2016, the election and last vacation day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommers have to make a choice war once again in the people.
The heavy phase, if you can say that, it's just started.
And it is also about: President Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in question clear behind the CDU.
It will be spending how strong newling declines and what remains at the end of coalitions.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 the Governing Boss, has made a almost unexpected choice fight, looking out from his large places.
He travels through the country, splits roses and splits a little with people, as it has already done his legendary prosecutor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Seeling has received cold foots and gives Canzler Merkel the responsibility of the afD.
Your refuge policy, "We create this" has decreased the growth of the legalists, which will now probably cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its captain candidate, the inner Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already learned how it is when you make a choice fight at the right place in the wrong time.
She invited the officer Angela Merkel two times to Grand County; Markel Bundesday election is in North East.
But the target group did not agree that there were more northern westfels, Berliners and Sachsen than Mecklenburgers and prepommers.
"The majority of other federal countries were probably there," claimed Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg, recently in NDR.
But there was no damage to listen to Angela Merkel once from other eckens of Germany.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU broadcasts the usual choice campaigns on market sites and before purchasing with solar screens and airballons.
That, like cokert, just play a "subordinated" role.
The Union has also noted that you're throwing the base on the country that she has to strive to find a road to people again.
You go like the left, the SPD, the Green: there is nowhere in the whites of the country.
However, the Council of the CDU electoral Cokert to his partners is also self-dead: "You must go where it is bad, namely where people are: villages, golden feasts, every birthday feast must be satisfied."
Because many are on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a specially engaged choice fight.
In question, the social democrats were tolerated with 22 Pro · behind the CDU partner (25) and only before the Department (19).
At the election of 2011, the SPD was still clear with 35.6 Pro± before the CDU (22).
The Green, the small party with seven pro inquiry, could create the sprung in the land.
They make a modern tugend from the vacation note and put their choice fight largely on the Internet.
"Online election fight", it is called the President of the country, Mämer.
On the other hand, green electors are looking for traces for domestic voting citizens among the vacants.
Silke Gajek, the Spitzen Kandidatin, just curve with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Sea and finds it beautiful.
Their impression: "Wowlcoming in Mecklenburg is not punishing."
B27-Sanation: Guests suffer under sper
The difficulty with which the B 27 is cured is nothing to mecker.
For the construction workers starting at 5.30 a.m. tomorrow and ending at 20 a.m., there are all praise.
"They have done everything quite sack," Elvira Tetzlaff said from the Jet Dancing.
That's a super team.
There's no delay too.
The building office was able to be placed planfully to South at the beginning of the week until the end of October has been completed.
The results of the building work will also be responsible, as well as when it is about the establishment of aid.
Since the building site has been converted to the south in Montenegro and has also been rejected by the aspergstray in Ofterdingen, and so that the connection to Rottenburg has been replaced, the departures have been disappointed within the place.
Now the citizens can react both sides from the B 27.
It seems to go back through the location.
" There were partly significant complaints," says the chief officer Florian King responsible for the criminal management of the sanation.
The residents of Bachsatz Streets, Steinless Streets, Hafner Streets and Weiherrain had to fight with more insights, because many swimming roads were swift and rather trusted their naviest than the insultation.
What resulted in some Lkw in residence areas.
Since the speed limits were also not complied, the community requested to strengthen the vehicle from mixtures.
"There were significant overcasts," says King, who told himself once before the place about the situation.
There have been two to three per minute.
The highest was on the road with 77 hours kilometres in the time-30-zone.
Since the building is continued, it has become stronger.
For businessmen at B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg is now the street open again.
Looking in the cards, businessmen do not want to.
But that the B 27-sanation has led to transmission inputs, let everyone who asks perceive.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Whoever has less to do with the "Endpoint" so produces for other companies, the sanction has no effect.
Thus Sulz says also at the car house of Maier of a "master easily back", but it also admits that "the news is missing".
The most powerful is the locals at the street.
J. Albert Göhner, Inhaber of Steakhouse, formal crown, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existing.
Not only him, but all guests have found it "hart".
The customers were missing from heaching, balling and redweil.
We need to be happy for every euro transmission.
The inputs are "for more than 50 Pro.".
The road-traveling has returned his operation for two years.
He had to leave the help of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and the help would have been released, it would have reacted differently.
Instead, the Governing President Jörg Schmidt has asked a request of Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation with the statement that the guests would benefit from the benefits of the situation in B 27. Now it must also be the advantages of the sanction.
Göner knows of other country circles, where such a greater thing has been handled.
At all appeals, Göners are sure that his guests will continue.
Since 1715, the family management has been assigned here, he refers to the long history.
That other staff guests now are less often previewed because of the complicated processing, he can understand.
If you can't get out, it's also beautiful.
That his staff client returns after the end of the sanction work, the Göner has no doubt.
Despite the crisis with BSE and bird influenza, Göners maintain the impact of B 27 building works on its knowledge of the greatest crisis that has taken his guests in their long-term history.
Six months of building, that's brutal.
In the name of the terrorist control, the laws are continually invoked.
After the latest requests, the Internal Minister de Maizière now provides a deep security package.
But what does a sustainable status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all of this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Foreigner.
All its proposals are "politically advisable to the coalition partner," says the Federal Ministry in the presentation of his new security package.
They don't convince anyone.
Other, continued points would be discussed inside the parties.
I also share it.
As a minister of the Interior, however, he was able to find out the results and a "accessible consensus" within the coalition.
The Maizière has laid down a little time after the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting its conclusions for security in the Republic.
But now, they are far more important to this.
Some things are already, announced, shared: that a new security staff should take care of the knife of encrypted communication is not new.
Not even the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU rules on flight data and weapons rights.
The call for more video monitoring and security participants is also not surprising.
In part, the Maizière starts a second approach for proposals that have not been made with the SPD: He wants to put a sympathia for terrorist groups under punishing and dschhihadists with double state citizenship the German pass buttons.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man calls.
However, he thinks that it is worthwhile and does not require anything that does not have any chances in the coalition partner.
A few new ideas also present the Maizière.
They have it partly in themselves: he has planned procedures for discharges and more opportunities to capture humans before delay.
Refugees that are obtained to the country shall earlier check their artphones and open social media accounts for a security check.
In the duration of refused asyl applicants, he wants to make some more worse than until a long time - including those who commit criminals or who reject their papers in order to decrease their integrity.
Some of these are political and legally heavy.
Some are still unexpected and make questions open.
And in some points, for example, in the inequality of patients, the question is: What does it have to do with security and terror?
Yes, the Maizière says it is important to distinguish between the subjects of refugees and terror.
But it can't be said that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Many people were concerned about security in view of the high refuge numbers.
And things that were most deeply employed, haven't been explained in choice times.
The internal security is extremely focused.
First in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussel, Nizza.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is big.
And yes, there's choice fights.
Therefore, the Union and the SPD are strictly in position on the issue of internal security.
In the past days, it went up between the two parties.
In the first case of a close fight on the exemption of the Federal Policy, the security policy collection of some Union internal ministers, in which the leaders also request a Burka prohibition and a derogation from the Duplicate State.
The Maizière is also attracted to a disgraceful tongue.
From a dual pass, he didn't keep anything.
We have satisfied the debate in Germany.
To re-open her, don't be sensible.
And in a Burka prohibition, he has constitutional reasons.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "motive" for the coalition partners, it must be shown.
There are some things inside which might take care of war.
However, the SPD is currently trying to profile internal security.
Partchef Sigmar Gabriel only signals carefully and says, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhance security."
People's cars are still lying.
Despite diel channels, the delivery numbers increase worldwide.
But not in all markets it runs around.
In the revocation action there is a term.
Pops cars start in the second half-year-old delivery.
Although Europe’s largest car builder can continue to be more like this, despite its many marks and some well-reaching markets.
However, in July, the Nuclear Mark VW was increasingly in Western Europe, and it reloaded the total extent, as it noted in Dax.
Worldwide, the VW mark was in July with 449100 cars 1,8 Pro > less than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, to China, the second important market, the sales were 14 Pro > under the previous month.
In the homemate of Germany, the deliveries cut off at almost a sixth.
Marker Manufacturer Jürgen Stackmann brought the weakest numbers from July in particular less than two days in Europe.
Moreover, in some nuclear markets, "modified economic framework conditions" have provided a holding of the purchase.
In addition to the situation in Turkey, the British vote has also been charged by a speaker from the EU.
In the United States, where the gas was first scaled, there is also a minus for books.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Generally, the mainly affected housemarks of the Netherlands are still lying through the Dash Channel: After the first seven months, only a delivery min of 0.9 Pro ± 3,37 million vehicles are booked.
Concern management officer Fred Kappler could continue to show a salesplus from January to July.
1,3 Pro ́ more vehicles offered people's cars at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Pops cars had manipulated with a software output tests.
Only in Germany VW calls about 2,5 million cars for recycling into the workshops.
In turn, VW confirmed that the construction of cars has no negative effect.
Following the recycling of vehicles, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine service did not cause any disorders.
The autobuilding provides the customers a "garantie equal" certificate after the replacement, but does not speak of a "garantie", as it was called in business circuits on Friday.
The reason is to be legal fines.
The "Focus" had reported that peoples cars would give his German customers a warranty for environmental design models.
This would have been working in the Federal Transport Ministry on the past Monday.
The Ministry of Department has been informed that there was a meeting.
"VW has completely fulfilled my Commission of investigation and the KBA's orders."
"The differences are not accepted," stated the Federal Transport Minister Alexander Doubindt (CSU).
The VW has assumed that in the consumption of fuel, CO2 emissions or engine service after recycling, there are no deficiencies and that all type-approval vehicles are unchanged.
Peoples cars themselves use the term "garantie" but not as it was called in business circuits.
For example, in the meaning "Garantie", people's cars see the possibility that customers come to a half year after the recycling of an engine damage - and that could return to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In addition to customer interest, it is important to avoid any other damage that does not have anything to do with the gas channel, to ensure the possibility of guarantee schemes, as it was called.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "garantie".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee requires rich Sparren future criminals - as the second institute in Germany.
Chief Joseph Paul said on Thursday, "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily pay accounts."
The Bundesband of German Banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it: normal sparers should not be protected for their spargrosy punishment.
Reserving the banks money on night at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to bear 0.4 Pro’s penalty.
This tax is required by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September of firm- and business documents for income over 100 000 euros on giro or daily payment accounts.
"The first 1000,000 euros are free."
"The next 1000,000 costs 400 euros per year," said Paul.
He has been guarding 40 million euros since a period of time, which could be removed from one day to the other and which he cannot conscious.
"They lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 Pro ́ costs," said the bank head.
"I can't put 4000 euros for each million."
The costs he continued after the caused prize.
The payment simply lies in the tresors of the bank of raifeises would be too careful: "I have already received four overfalls, I don't like the fifth!", said the bank advice.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of installation.
Just a few of them went to other banks.
"The extreme monetary currency of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks."
They are too alone, "building economically not permanently possible".
Therefore, some German banks have increased their taxes for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalties for income from three million euros, the Türinger of the peoples and raiffeisenbank of Altenburg with their tax bank offices 2014 had made a shopping line.
Michael Kemmer, the main business leader of the banking band, said: "We do not expect employment ability to pay pay payments for investments, the competition in Germany between banks and sparcasses is too strong."
A banker said that at the Tegernsee there was "a customer that has been evacuated by the power."
"This can be a problem for a small bank," if she keeps free money.
The Society Bank of Gmund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region there are players, sporters and undertakers.
"No other banks are currently calculating a summary for institutions of customs," said speaker Ernst.
The President of the Federation of the German Peoples Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Happy, said, "The weakness to go to the negative point is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it threatens the immigration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not be worth it.
Destination Places: Who buys Stocks?
Single men in the middle of the age love plates.
Before you get to the comment part to translate it under the Pseudonym NonAlleAssumenMandeMittlerenAlters with raw practices, this statement leads to the current data.
YouGov says that the many-specific rebuilding of shields is not on a tree in Millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but to return to Midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently buyed a plate are all the previews of the age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely purchase group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has a emotional importance: older plates buyers keep their feelings better for themselves (56 % in 53 %) and enjoy it to take time only (69 % in 66 %).
But are the results of YouGov?
If this blog would have a news report in television, the camera would follow me while I was running in a busy street in Soho, weakening a slight green joke and gesture before I stay, hold my hands and say something significant as, "Thus, let us go a closer to it."
So let's get us a cut on it.
Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly invoked to ✔ Charme - Hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which one independent sales were located - it is like a handful fantastic platform special business.
I would probably ask the cameraman to disable the camera for the next part in which I stand directly close to different men in such businesses and try to evaluate their age and treasure by watching.
Stuart from Glassgow, 55, which I follow by Sister Ray (date number: two young women, three men in the middle age) in the Reckless Records (date number: eight men in the middle age, a woman, probably about the 20) is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector?
"I appreciate it," he said.
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.
These shields, pictured above (he sent me the snippet by email, I didn't follow him home), dressed the walls of his room.
The reason why he has so significant number of albums and Singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he couldn't be allowed to buy when they appeared and bought items that he bought when he was young and played.
"Multiple things I bought are from the late 60s, early 70s that occurred when I was 11 or 12s. things where I probably was too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are more introverted and like to take time alone, and f·to add: "I don't fuck and I don't try very much.
That's my charge.
Wez, 25, who is at Sister Ray , also believes that many customers he met to the YouGov profile.
However, he also noted a new whale of people who are influenced by the mediahpe, people who have heard about the comback and have been allowed to buy their old plates again.
From the talks I've conducted, people have usually conducted their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once made their disks to buy CDs, now exhaust their CDs to buy their disks again," he says.
This would declare the tree to the attorneys of a certain age.
But what about the emotional importance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business such as Phonica to recognize that platform businesses offer a strong community of equals.
According to Wez, some of the elderly customers took anxiety to the uncontakt payment system.
Some platforms feel overwhelming from the digital world and want to turn back to the stability of trusted skin plates, from the subjects that rise to happy youth records.
"I think, sometimes it can be the F's feed of an empty or the property of material owners than a sort of comfort," says Wez.
It's me as a collector, and I think it's the way for many people.
It's a simple way to work spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" A worker runs out from a platform staple.
A question of the ICM in April enth replied that almost 50% of the people who have purchased a table last month have not yet heard.
The investigation also discovered that 41% of a disk player they never used, while 7% of those who buy a plate doesn't have a disc player.
At this time of the message report, I would probably look very worried while I bleeded through a stapel on Bossa Nova Compil.
Jonny, 42, who has observed a "tropheen attitude" of the Revival in Sounds of the Universe.
"Nobody came here soon and said, "I don't want to play a player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead screen plate so I can put it in the regulation," he said.
This is not a big progress, but it is definitive.
More productless, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a player."
They're younger people, not elderly, who's just lately entered.
Fopp, which has almost a whole etage of the skin disk, has a greater public when I come in.
There are couples around the 70, tourists, making photos, teenages and women in the middle of age.
Even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previous businesses - Wild Beast's latest synthesis and sexually packaging pop instead of experimental Jazz - it is good to see such diversity in customers.
No one of them looks solely, but increasing psychic traumata is difficult to be found when you stand for about 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, runs in the business for a few minutes and considers the variation of the plates to sell.
She's just making a screen-screen bubble as a big cup.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs much.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the niceness of plates is..." it's treated with a loved sepper.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last hold is a business, which is said that a new generation of plate-friends must have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
As I was given the appearance of the Jeans-Hotpants, I watched a group of young teaage kids who were grouping for a moment for pollaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decided to buy a Crosley plate player.
To the left, there is a travelhouse, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of modern genetic music and classics, the essential plates for a average collection.
No one looks at it - maybe because they're just clean decorative, some are so far up that it's impossible to take it.
It's a clean plastic art.
But in view of that every attraction for these objects would mean more money for the breach and could send some customers to the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is not surprised that a population group who has more time and money than others is also the one who is mostly exposed to luxe events such as plates.
Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov are voting, they, at least in plates businesses in Soho, allow the large number of women's collectors and players who exist in reality, plates and online fores.
These people probably work hard in school or offices.
They don't take their Thursday tomorrow with safeness with the bowling by the Berwick Street and the brochure through plates, while they feed the staring cock of an in secret, 30-year-old wrong modernator, which does not take any extraordinary men of the middle age over the schools.
The Greenlandhai is the latest lived wild animal - Video report
Increasingly, Greenlandhai has the longest level of life of all emblems on the planet.

The French Court refuses to dismiss businesses in Dschungel refugee campaign
A French court has rejected a boat of the authorities in Calais to reduce thousands of provisional businesses and restaurants in the district of Calais, in the end of thousands of refugees.
In a court negotiation this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be authorised to reduce 72 provisional businesses in which persons in the store of goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, offer friction services or tee for 50 cents (40 pens) or simple feed time for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture Calais argumented that these places should be reduced because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no tax would be paid, and they would have a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants were important because the free foods offered by the State supported union and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also concluded that the provisional business and restaurants often would offer free food for people in need.
A court in Lille discovered that there is no legal basis for the exhibition of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but claimed that the thoughts of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely "complete."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food businesses, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than eating only people who live in extremely expensive conditions.
He said that the areas offer adequate meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened by the Netherlands was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the stock, which is remotely driven and offers 200 feeds on the day, English and French classs, as well as a advice to asyl cases for hundreds of protective, uncommitted minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have understood the petition to keep the kids' cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure was "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the latest eight years of age."
The two assistant organizations Help refugees and L'Auberges of the Migrant estimated on Friday that the number of lives in the Dschungellare were increased to over 9.000 people - the maximum number until now - after a steady increase of new campaigns during the summer.
Despite Olympia dilution: Martin remains spectacular
Despite his disturbing occurrence in the Olympical Times, Radprofi Tony Martin will not be understood.
"I'm keeping the WM in ́ck, staying confident and fighting," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his abbreviation from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
A clothing for his miserable 12 places on the sugarhout he doesn't have.
"I feel honestly saying it's hard to comment the time of yesterday," said Martin.
He needs to analyze in silence what reasons would have led to the debate.
At the timeway-WM in October in Katar, Martin wanted to fight the title.
"I'll look at everything that we have changed in the last time."
"This also counts my position," wrote the three-time wheelmaster, who had lost the middle-week at 54.5 km more than three minutes on the Olympian Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).

Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
German Raser must be set up to the next generation of speed masters: in different federal countries, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new access devices are tested that the temperaments should be transferred particularly effectively.
For example, the future efficient Enforcement Trailer of the Vitronic firm from Wesbaden can be used to accidents where it would be too appropriate for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no needed infrastructure to ensure that with a stationary facility to comply with the speed limit.
However, a permanent mobile building can be too appropriate or external.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: His battery holds five days on uninterrupted mixture, and the fall data will be encrypted over a Property.
In addition, with Laser mechanism, all vehicles can be taken via several tracks simultaneously.
Variable speed limits and transition prohibitions after time, vehicle trails and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In a highly dangerous state, the attacher can be moved by the manufacturer with each car with an attachment copper.
In order to not simply be closed, he is semied in the mixture, so that the roads will disappear in the painted and otherwise safe outside.
 a recorded alarm facility should make the most of the vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by Vitronic information in various aliens countries and also been used in the meantime.
Along with the new technology, foreign authorities: Youngest France has ordered 100 pieces, after order of 150 pieces in the past year.
United Kingdom takes silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of the Great Britain at the 7th Rugby came to the final on Thursday evening at a breakfast at the last hole in the form of Fijis when they were shot with a result of 43-7 in the Deidoro stadium here in Rio.
Fiji distributed a master class in the action, side-stopping, backs, line run and red power to win gold - their first olympia media of each colour.
The download was delivered by the not too bad comfort price of the silver medaille - British fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear download of the box, 7-5 in half final on the same day could fall back on them at the end.
But if it were so, Fiji would have made a 15-man team best in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medaille around his hair: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former leader for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a weak way behind.
Eight years ago, they lost each game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here she just lost one.
This sleep will be hurt, but the progress is surprising.
Fiji started marvelous and left the attacks of GBs from spass.
It felt to Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. like to run in running buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau was overtooked in the corner.
With four minutes more game time, Jerry Tuwai made another attack from the right corner he converted.
12-0 and GB haven't reached the ball.
An amazing tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a gate, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua moved a touchdown in the right corner and was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa feed a new one since the repeat and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou preached by further weak tacklings of the GB team and smoked up to the line to make a gate.
The conversion was a 29-0 to pause.
It's like Fiji was born to play 7 while GB still learned.
That's it.
GB led basic changes to half time and ended the Fijian lunch... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova passed after a constant middleplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started a trial for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long for the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, feed and danced on the tribe.
It wasn't hard to wonder the player approach Fijis.
Mata Viliame put the i-depth with another trial in the last seconds.
The Pfiff felt that Fijis was insulted and GB kicked devastating in the races.
Before that day, Fiji Japan had seen in the half finish with 20-5 and the United Kingdom pressed South Africa into a half-final math button from the United Kingdom conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown faced the box in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate under the posts in the second half.
A recent tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the 15-Aside teams, protected the win - and thus the silver medaille.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the tree to Rudersieg
There will be no emotional gold than these games, and that wants something to be called.
From the first rude up to the last, 220 hard wheeves that enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a common importance in their golden moment at Stacio da Lagoa.
Even if there were only the two who were sitting on the road, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the Tra's Robin Williams, was alive when they rolled to the second olympiagold in two without tax wife, the first women in the history of the British sport, which put such a measure.
Her dominance was absolutely, still its 39th unprecedented use, which is also without example.
What we see is two ≥iantian atletins that go over the surface with the elegancy of wheat, which doesn't reflect the type of triumph.
At the back of every gold in the wheat, a battlelon stands on voluntary helpers, to the incredible progress that makes the subsequence, and it was no more helper than the tree, who didn't know if he would survive this day in general than cancer.
Like he said he was something risking.
I had blue cancer that was operable and they did that.
If you don't do that, he's going to go throughout.
It would have been a very bad situation.
It's a little changed the view.
Williams was enhanced in December 2013.
The Trio had the happiness that he was treating the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could begin what the interruption held at a minimum, if this is in such circumstances the right term.
I needed money, so I had to go back soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and went to the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rudering is already a challenge, but it makes it more.
In the immediate victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who made something more than otherwise to speak and so try to process his own enemy.
Stanning, who was a main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a use in Afghanistan, said, "I was this week a emotional wrack. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much it means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have made.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thanks to him, he's the best tree of the world.
I couldn't want a better person to train or a better tragedy.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't been lost in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythmus with which their enemies couldn't keep.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to be locked, Stanning and Glover had too much reserves.
We were very arrested at the moment.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to let it be dismissed.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't going to do something great.
We wanted no firework today, we just wanted to get a result, go out and win the run that we did.
The couple will take a time for a year before decisions about his future.
Glover needs to appear next week at a holiday, her own with the TV advocate Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last run.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it was about six months to understand that I was a olympian.
It was all new for me, and I was so scared.
Here was about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 Years for example provided for clearness
The Business Director of the Water Stone Group, Ruppert G Tweeer, is going to the rest.
The link applies as "exemplely".
A small French drinking water band as an example for the big water product.
So it was called in the original tone sometimes in a contribution of the Bayerische d́s.
Soon afterward, the water forum of the Government of subfractions deserved the destination.
The work of the Veteran Steel Group was "for example".
After all, Rupert G.G.E., who was 31 years in the aim of the employee, is 28 years of business leader.
Now he was disappointed in the rest of 65 years.
The drinking water connection of the Vetenstone group with Sitz in Kottendorf, Community Breitbrunn, promotes around 150000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and whistlers with about 5500 inhabitants.
Members are the Communities of Kirchla, Breitbrunn, La日, Ebelsbach and the city Baunach.
For other cities and communities there are water supply contracts.
The current president, the Breitbrunns citizen Gertrud Bühl (FW), noted that Rupert Gjumar 1985 was established as a water waiting and was already called as a business manager of the destination.
"Their tasks have been very high and have been excited from the water management and maintenance work on Office and organizational activities, the creation of budgetary, calculation of taxes and contributions until week-end needs," said the Chairman.
As a wonderful event, she called the introduction and enhancement of the new sources (1994), basic sales in the field of new sources (1998) and the refund of agricultors, the sanation of high-containers (1999), the regeneration of a central computer management (2004) and the shared renewals of water guides.
It has not given any silence and you have always recorded news because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio, she praised Gipers faithful, trusted and correct service over 31 years.
He used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water flowing band and he regularly made the water-wide band as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, he has been able to present the successful concept of the Veterinary Steel Group for nitrate depreciation before the water forum of the area underfractions.
That is why he has received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Gěer, praised waterwater Alfons Griebel, who has joined 28 years with him.
He's the best water waiting and he was a faithful boy.
And together, we were an insuper team.
As high points from his view, he covered the source building and restructuring of the target band.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, but the breath of the roof was at the top of the Kirchla's coast on 3 January.
Here you have to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night in order to provide the areas with water.
In addition, the supply of Neubrun can only be maintained because you have found the Pett city's high-container with slippers.
The business management of the drinking water band was delivered to Daniel Stürmer from La日, which approaches the follow-up of Rupert G.
The sopranistinity of Netrebko is open with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other concerned parents: "You must have the courage to talk about."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian magazine "Core della Sera".
When the disease was recognized with her son, she believed she had to die.
The eight-year Tiago, however, was well advanced and now learn private in New York, where the best therapeutes were given.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that returns two years when I sing at the Mayland Scala, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he's the most happy man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection to the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She's now married with Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relational status in Bargedade - Man shoots on life-free
A 35-year-old man shot on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multiple family house in Bargethede (Kreis Stormarn) on his partner and killed her.
"The man himself called with us and indicated that he had shot his lifemates," said a police speaker.
The teater is on the flight, after him it will be publicly added.
The middle of the middle, because Sven S. could be with the car on the road.
The man is about 1,80 metres large, muscleless, burning and having a glass.
In the meantime, the police published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
In the middle of the man, the man has a glass.
The man shouldn't be invited directly.
He's still able to get the weapons with him, so the police.
Whoever sees Sven S. will call the 110.
The police speaks of a "related state".
The victim is the year 1988, the teater of 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the tattoo or the relationship between the tattoos and the victims; but she realized that a man was killed.
"It's a murder dealer."
"We're not talking anymore," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eye witnesses, a special adjustment command (SEK) was at the Tatort.
Steel - Light View for German steel industry
The crucial and energy-intensive German steel industry remains adequate costs in millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the broadcast from the promotion of Ö≤rom are from the table.
In the release of the renewable energy environment in the substances for the so-called own flow production in the German steel industry, the Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) said "WAZ, Friday issue".
"I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of close negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gas from the cotton for electrical production for its own consumption.
The steel industry, according to the information of the German Branch Connection, costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year were costed.
Gabriel said WAZ, there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission in accordance with the Commission of the Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, a EEC environment of 20 Pro.
But they will not be highlighted in the steel industry.
The IG metal welcomed the agreement of Germany with the Commission of the European Union on the production of own flows.
This will be extended to the status Quo of the current scheme.
The effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is significant.
"In view of our campaign 'Stale is the future', this is the first step."
"There must be followed."
"And in the reform of the Emissions Rights, climate and employment objectives are to be rejected," IG Metal Chairman Jörg Hofmann said in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
In the past year, the situation continued when the worldwide producerland China was cut off in the light of the weaking home request of massive steel in the world.
European producers propose Chinese steel concerns Price.
During this early year, the situation has disappointed something.
In order to demonstrate the effect of import tariff, the economic perspectives in China have been achieved.
It is unexpected how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German Branchen Prince Thyssenkrup remained careful on Thursday.
The prices would have been stagnized again.
The branch reacts to the difficult situation with further cost rates.
Thyssenkrupp would not be allowed to exclude the closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, about 86000 people were employed in the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite increased prices and orders.
They produced with 3,4 million tonnes well six per rubber steel less than in the previous month, as the economy unit reported on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the manufactured amount went back in the second month.
From the beginning of the year, the production is under the previous year.
The link calculates in the coming months, thanks to a improved job with an increased expenditure.
Community, Spirit, Health: Songs do good
The song has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: When a young girl was in school, she was in the teacher studio, and today the 78-year-old songs are in a 78-year-old currency.
"Sing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, happy and all more alive, she says.
Besides, she does something good with her health and her mind.
Because Singen is just a great hobby for the elderly, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorliga.
Most of the elders sang in Chor and shared the joy in music with similar sensors, described Hackler.
By regular combination, elders can contact and manage social contacts.
Because often social and social structures are resolved in the age, a chor is then an ideal opportunity to take time with others.
This experience also made Ursel Kipp in his chor: "I'm going to talk and organize, to leave and learn from others - a Chor is a very special form of cohesion."
Songs can be in a positive sense stressing, says Hackler.
Because the elders train a deep and controlled breath.
Whoever regularly requests his longs, doesn't make all day so quick out of the puzzle.
Even if it is to receive the sound of the voice in the age, songs are a optimal hobby.
The older men often have a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Community of the former organizations.
In the elderly generation, the common song had a lot of place value, which belonged to every day, both in school and in free time, she explained.
Lenz often observes that the song or hearing of songs in elderly people wake many memories, often related to positive feelings of their youth.
Through song texts and particularly melodies, demenzers are being deceived in long-reverse events.
In Singen, the head will also be requiring a special performance, explaining Lenz.
At the same time, can you conceive your own voice and a given rhythmus and adapt to the other songs - that is a great cognitive challenge.
The elderly people who live alone practice not only to be able to be on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition of the song in Chor, Hackler.
A gentle public is a great praise.
Moreover, the self-value feeling we through singing in Chor.
See yourself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow out - this experience strengthens.
So good reasons to start with the song are enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not swim - even if he thinks to have a little talent, race Lenz.
You don't sing alone - 50 songs, who hears when a sound goes?
On the search for the employment boat, elders have different opportunities, says Hackler.
If someone from the acquainted circle in a senior cross, you can simply join yourself.
In addition, cities offer reviews about the hearing in the environment.
Whoever wants to sing in a church Chor can turn directly to the congregation or to the church leader.
You are also found on the Internet.
Whoever doesn't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the Internet search.
Whoever has a pleasure to sing should be attached to a chor, advise Hackler.
Sing makes the soul good and has something free -- that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than the cater on the cries of the young animals
Biologists have examined in Hannover what effect the calling of catch babys on adult animals has.
Their surprise also did not leave the men cold - but they always stayed in the subsequence of women.
Women's cats can recognize the degree of catch babies at the miau of the little ones.
They react about → Pro ́ more rapidly on the sound of cats that are in great trouble, how animal high schools and the medical school Hannover (MHH) have discovered.
Although Catherine also reacts to the call of cattle - however, it is always the same.
"Offently, the acustic differences between the milk of less and strongly identified boys for men are not acceptable or not significant," said the biologist Wiebke Conerding from the MHH.
She is the first one published at this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research had already discovered that the duration and tone of the cotch chain was distinguished with the difficulty of their need for help.
Overall, nine grown caters and eight cates from the MHH animal maintenance were observed.
They were played for a call of little ones who were taken out of the Wurfbox for three minutes and beared by mother and sisters.
In other cases, they were confronted with cries of stronger injured kitchens that were regularly highlighted.
The researchers maintain their results despite the low test of exhaustive tests.
"All women, even those who had no own adults, responded differently to the cry," Conerding said.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call was played by the very highlighted boxes.
This ability may be born or developed with the sex.
"It was a surprise that the men had reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, people have already studied the reactions of women and men on childhood.
In addition, some of them showed that women were more sensitive to young people, just as they had been mothers or not, the biologist Marina Schumann reported.
Podolski goes with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sukur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, the only football star Hakan Sukkür has been adopted.
He's going to be a member of a terrorist group.
First after the puzzle trial, Turkey will find a important football game again.
Before the duell of the errivals between Besichtas Istanbul and Luke Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly indicated: "Business as ’al".
In the event of the exceptional state after the trial in July, the Government decreased that the entire day of normal citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are deceived to listen to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, responsible for the temptation of the puzzle.
It will also not be kept before the football.
In contrast with the former Starkicker Hakan Sukur, the State advocate made a detention order.
Therefore, the middletime of America's live sugar will be a member of a terrorist group.
Sukur shall be the attachers of the Preacher Fethullah Gülen, responsible by Recept Tayyip Erdogan for the trial.
If the exemption state for 90 days is applied until October, it actually has the lives of most Turkish but does not have any effect.
The nightly "Democracy-Wachen" on public places throughout the country explained that Erdogan was completed at the middle-week.
The sport is - like the whole country - split in the enemies and enemies of Erdogan.
The Fans of the Worker Club Besichtas are traditionally not the friends of the President.
What the Great of Turkeys, however, in view of dramatic experiences in the history, is the strike delay of military pounds.
There are even the fans themselves agree - not whether their heart is broken for Galatasaray or faces.
In Pokalsieger 'Gala', it will return to Luke Podolski.
His sports value was evident at the past season: with 17 tours and nine models in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first game time as a topscore of his union.
At the end of the game against Phenerbace, he reached the 1:0 search match.
The magazine "Fanatic" loved him, "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in excellent way and secured his community the pocal.
Thanks "Poldi" found the disturbing season for the recordmaster an extraordinary conclusion.
After the pre-rounding C.o in the Champions League, the "Lives" also separated early in Europe League.
In the Süper Lig, it's just six rows.
The season wasn't good.
The pocal was the only way to win something.
"This is what we have created and this is the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besichtas, the game year was better.
In particular, thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 season officers as the King of Süper-Lig-Tors, sets the base for the title 14.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope back of the 31th year.
In this context, the Florence under the Treaty and on the Beachtas only provided a gomez after the puzzle trial because of the political situation in the country after EM licence.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just needs to say it," the "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman cited.
But it should be ready to deal with a third of its annual salaries estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman explained: "We can't kill its content in Florence."
Despite Do日: These athletes have still medal Chance at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked two times due to Do©s (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa cannot start in Rio.
Other translated light athletic singers can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medalans.
The Theme Do ́ determines as before the lines of the Olympics games in Rio.
The Russian swimming girl Julia Jefimowa, who had accused her start right shortly before the games, was gnadened and exploded at its start (100 meters of Brust).
There was a sharry scene: With a set lake she was still stolen in the hall and had caused her income.
As it found that it wouldn't get gold, it would be the public in a jubel storm.
However, there are still many other sporters who, despite the past, go to the Olympics games in Rio to start.
Here's a review:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m staff/USA): The 34-year-old belongs to the most restricted figures in the light athletic.
He was already locked two times due to Do©s (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since the Bann is running the olympionist of 2004 and the ex-Welt Master even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one of the world and is applied as the greatest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100,4x100-m-staffel/Jamaica): The two-time olympionist and seven-wide world master had to stay in 2010 a six-month lock after it was demonstrated that the oxycodon pain was taken.
After a operation, she had strong dental pain, she defended the 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): 2011 was tested by the Olympiager of 2012, the World Master of 2013 and the European Master from 2010 to 2016 positively on the prohibited methylhexanamin middle.
Perkovic addresses the scientific receipt and has been locked six months.
The four most important worries this year go to the account of the large gold favoritin.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staffel/USA): The Peking olympics and two-mill world masters were tested over 400 m, 2010 was positively tested and was locked 21 months.
A fund for penis size was responsible, charged Merritt.
In this year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man of the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hamerwurf, white-russland): Nearly one athlete was so many medals soon known.
Thus Tichon lost his WM title of 2005 nine years later after he was found with testosteron-Do.
The average 40-year-old Olympia silver in 2004 was also required for the Steroid Do©s and the EM Title 2006 for testosteron misuse.
The obtained Bronzemedaile of the Olympical Games 2008 has also received the return on the basis of a sentence of the International Sport Court of CAS.
With 80.04 m he lies on the range two of the world range lists.
Liu Hong (20 km Go, China): The well-tree ordeer and gold favoritin were tested only in May, but can be started in Rio.
At the 29-year World Master, indications were found to take a prohibited neighborhood complementary means, the lock of the World Anti Do Agency WADA fell mildly out and went out on 13 July.
Bombentherror in Thailand - Austrian Zaled
The Austrian message in Thailand stands in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Foreign Minister, Thomas Schn日, Friday morning.
You have suffered interruption and have been treated in the hospital, but you have already been able to leave it again.
Her home travel has planned her for the beginning of September.
If the other explosions are affected on the vacancy island of Phuket, as well as in the Southern towns Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, it is not clear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities such as Sn.
In about 200 miles south of the capital city of Bangkok, Hua Hin was exploded in two bombs on Thursday.
In this case, police were killed by a Thailand and were killed about 20 people, including Austrian, three Germans, three Netherlands and three Italians.
Friday morning, two spendings went up again, and another person was killed by the authorities.
Furthermore, Phuket was reported a bomb explosion before.
At the detonation near the bathroom border of Patong in the nearby of the vacancies, a taxi-factor was deceived according to police data.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, there then exploded another bomb that killed a local employee.
The extent is due to the authorities in a flower beach before the coast police river.
S日 still requested the Detonity in Phang Nga and Trang at the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast.
A connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.
"The Bombbenattentate 日 the same manuscript," said Armageddonal Danai Kritmethavee Friday Friday before journalists.
"We're determining that it's a coordinated attack."
It's too early to express a positive motive - but it's probably about the acts of muslimous rebels.
Thailand media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police claimed that the attentates were not related to the islamist movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local Sabotage, which limits to restricted areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Moreover, the bombs were placed by enemies of the Governing Military Junta.
In the past days, the authorities would have received secretal indications on previous attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places.
Anyway, be unexpected what group should be put behind the attacks.
The police encouraged their employees in the whole country to strengthen security around the major government buildings and airports, trains, tourist attractions, restaurants and enjoyment quarters.
In Thailand there are still smaller bombs, but mostly they are not against tourists.
In Hua Hin there is a palace used for years by King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.
According to the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Minister recommends on his homepage to submit the indications of the Thai security participants.
High Safety risk (Security level 3) gained for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and environment.
After interactions between security forces and muslim population parts, there will be no needed travel in these provinces.
Increased security risk (Security level 2) is payable for the country's.
The proposals on Thursday and Friday have been made a few days after a conflicted referendum on a constitution of the military Junta.
This is also a great influence to the military in the coming years.
Junta-Cheef and Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were a trial to strike chaos while the country moved towards stability, a improvement of the economies and tourism.
The military unit, which after a phase of bleeding injuries, had taken the power of 2014, seems likely to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military officer has not been able to get the murmural rebellious rebellion in the outer south of the country since years.
More than 6500 people were killed in the conflict.
There were also 20 people killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular hindu-screen - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the youngest history of the country.
The right "Idential Movement" is set into the Vision of the Federation of Constitutional Protection Authority.
According to several country members, the Constitutional authorities also observed the group.
"We see the "Idential Movement" points for efforts against the free democratic basis," said the Constitutional Protection Boss Hans-Georg Maasen of the German Presse Agency in Berlin.
So immigrants of islamic faith or from the Near East are distributed in extremist way.
That is why we are watching the movement now.
The "Idential Movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "the loss of its own efficiency through overbreak".
Constitutions more in nine countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Netherlands, Sachsen and Thüringen - are already watching the "Identitaries".
Maasen said that his authority voted closely with the country members in the decision.
"Groups like the "Idential Movement" are trying to remove their target group where it is," said the Constitutional Protection Chair.
Generally, Extremistes are trying to talk to younger language, often with poppy music.
It eats islamists as well as legal extremistes.
This is not a significant publicity for the own thing.
The Propaganda will respond to the people emotionally.
Young people are especially attacked there.
That's an anniversary.
ZuletProperty had given reports from several federal countries on contacts of the "Identitarians" to AfD policies.
Maasen said he had no knowledge of it.
For the protection of the Constitution, such contacts may be relevant only from a certain point.
It refers to whether the relevant party, in this case, changes their objective direction and becomes so extremistic by certain persons who are extremists.
It is, therefore, exhaustive whether such persons have influence on the party.
This is not recognisable.
With a view to the clear increase of legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum applicants and refugees, Maases said that he would not yet speak of a new right terrorism.
But in the past years, we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the "Old School Society" group or the Freetal Group.
There may be further legal terrorism groups or smallest groups that plan attacks against asyl seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-extremeistic motives.
However, a German or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognisable.
The current groups are at the regional level or in social networks.
Many mistakes came to the account of people who had not occurred before in the right scene.
That's the threatening.
In the case of the fact-remembering attacks on asylum meetings, they were not previously criminal, politically motivated criminals or appealers of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that have never had any right-extremistes before, which may have been politically indifferent or, for example, selected CDU, SPD or links, which have then radicalized themselves by the right-extremistic voting method."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte will be online
The Olympics or World Records do not always determine the lines of the Olympical Games.
This shows the courageous adventure of Robel Kiros had at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the easily overweight weights of Ethiopians were so quiet that he was not more to see in the TV images.
He disappeared simply - no matter how far the outset was chosen.
In the social networks, then, the viral Internet hit was held.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended with a 48-second rest, and the 59th place of 59 starters.
However, it was not just his sports figure, which moved to the attention of international media.
Why, though, the 24-year-old shares in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian has received a special starting right from the international swimming band.
This is distributed to make swimming in subrepresentated countries.
Since most sporters run in Ethiopia, they just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is finished for the great run.
The first names made the winds.
Some mediums made him a "Robel of the Wales".
In the case of a "Wollow-stock" the English Boulevard sheet "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made it fun over him.
His time, he shot only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of free style, did not play a role there.
Similarly, comparisons with "E日 the Eel" were also made.
In the olympical games 2000 in Sydney, Eric Moussambani provided median attention.
Unforgettable, the surrounding of the swimming from the Equatorial Guinea, when he had to arrive alone in a period of more than 100 meters of free style.
Freneticly, Moussambani was at that time packed.
At that time, the 22-year-old learned eight months before Olympia and had never solved a long distance before the fight.

Trump doesn't seem so hard
The Republican presidential calendar Donald Trump refers to a election campaign in Florida.
If it doesn't take the choice to the US President, Donald Trump has already an alternative.
Then he's getting into the vacation.
Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, it would be relatively unintentional to him: "I'm finally going to go, or I have a very, very beautiful, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the CNBC TV.
If it doesn't rule for him at the end of political correction, if it's okay, Trump said.
Thus he approved the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the leader of the terrorism of the Islamic State (IS).
Inside his party, there was a more recent opposition.
Post increases in trade with electronic transporters
A electro-country vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is apparently large.
The post plants to overflow its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
In Kürze, the concern wants to start trade with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electronic transporters from the next year also on the free car.
"We want to enter the sale of thirds," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has examined whether it should be delivered with letters and packages for months to be overcome to other operations.
Post-representation Jürgen Gerdes had said that it was always asked again, about handworkers.
According to the information of the "The Spiegel" news store, the bonner concern in Kürze will enter the mass production of vehicles.
In the post-determined manufacture, the company plans to build up up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the concerns wanted clearly to increase its float of electric cars and to peil a long-term completion to the environmental friendships.
"We will make a very, very strong step toward 2020," he said end of July.
I can imagine we're converting the complete float.
The StreetScooter has been active on German streets since 2014.
GfK-führer declines after dismissing business numbers
The GfK Consumer Research Company exchanges his Chef Matthias Hartmann.
Even so, the returns came suddenly, but not very surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research undertaking GfK noted that the chairman Matthias Hartmann's stole would be more uncertain, as longer the success that he had been pronounced.
Turbulence at the top of the Nürnberger Market Research Company GfK: After renewable business payments and the return of the business management, the world number Five of the Branche is before a personal new start.
GfK Presidency Chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The President of the GfK Supervisory Council, Arno Mahlert, has already been separated from the supervisory framework until 12 September.
The headquarters already adopted the former member Gerhard Hausruckinger until 1 September, the company shared.
He must officially take the function of a "president speaker" until a follower for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the retractions, the company called a long-term business policy orientation.
The details would not be called a business speaker on Friday.
Whoever will promptly lead the market research undertaking is currently unexpected.
In investors' circles, on Friday, the actors were called to be late for the distortion of the remaining success of the restructuring beginning years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK hospital since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after five years," he said.
In view of the recent bad GfK employment payments, each shareholder will sometimes be insufficient.
"If that was in BMW the case, that would also do the events like that," he said.
The company could not stop his loss carriage in the previous quarters in the second quarter of 2016.
With 361,2 million euros, the conversion was 6,1 Pro > under the level of the comparable annual quarter.
In the first half year, the rate of EUR 721,2 million was decreased by EUR 3,4 per.
The winning in the second quarter of the company has charged, in particular, the deep value of the company in view of its weak economic situation.
The business records of 139 million euros in the business area of consumer experience protected the concern under the stream a loss of 148,2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK was acquired of 19.7 million.
Incidences - Bus washing in crops in graves: Eight Losses
In an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were lost on Thursday in CrommmCurnes (Aurich Circles).
Two of the insects suffered serious damage, the police shared.
The 66 years old carrier of the bus of a traveling company from the Icenack had to disclose its information as a result of a laster that was part of the railway.
The bus went from the street right and went into a grave, as reported a police speaker of Aurich/Wittmund.
"From the situation of the bus, people couldn't leave the bus independently," she said.
The firewall delivers the insects.
Six saving cars and a note car came to the accident site on the road 2.
The unseen travelers were brought back from a line bus to the city part of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the traveling company.
The investigators invited the laster driver and possible Witnesses to report to the police.
The taxes per cubik meter waste are used from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welchenkahl 3.44; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lop 3,36 euros (by 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (to 2.18 euros).
In the installation in Azendorf, the waste rate will be increased at the latest, if appropriate improvements are required.
After a excessive calculation, the waste price in Azendorf will be 4,37 euros per cubic meter.
As citizen Bernd Steinhauser (CSU) reported, the Court of Agriculture Kulbach authorised that the undercovers for these wastewater facilities were covered.
The Casendorf market is binding on the basis of legal basis to carry out the facilities costly.
Since 1 October 2016, the citizens and the warehouse and industries of well-scale, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take the deeper in the money bullets.
The tax increases are between 48 and 67 Pro.
As the Governing Board Herbert Schmidt showed the Gremium, a new calculation of taxes was necessary for the wastewater facilities of the market.
In the period of October 2016-September 2020, over-related coverages from the previous calculation period are also to be compared.
The severe tax increases founded by Schmidt that all three wastewater installations were related to relatively small plants with a very small waste attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
This would, for example, affect the low distribution basis of applications for the necessary repairs of several thousands of euros.
Furthermore, the water waste in all three installations is easily delayed.
For all three installations, in the latest calculation period, they have not been added to a significant amount due to their age of sanction and reparation applications.
The installation in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for welkenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical aircraft was to be altered in the Azendorf waste installed on the basis of a damage.
In the pumpwork Welschenkahl, nearly 20 years of age were required to be recovered, and Lopp had to be able to be able to carry out the operation of the first glass box after approximately 20 years of age, providing the clear lamp and building an additional flexibility in order to comply with the water-right conditions.
Schmidt: "To these exceptional applications, the continued maintenance and preservation costs were to be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity, which remained clearly under the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhouse showed that, in the short fall of water in the three installations, the applications for the operation and entertainment were "complete".
In this case, additional Schmidt, the market shareholder of large interview costs remained in the last 20 years.
The situation for those installations will continue to be deteriorated, as the view of stone houses, even if the area of supply of the wasteband is not able to extend these installations because it is the internal institutions.
Bulgaria is first exploded in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that the inflation in Bulgaria was based on a monthly basis in July 1%.
This is the maximum value (from June 2012) and the first more than zero since October last year, as a positive 0,2 %.
The average average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) resulted in CPI-0.8 %.
The consumer price index compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation compared to July 2016 to -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase in the following groups of consumers was observed in July 2016: food and non-alcohol trees (1,7 %); transport (1,8 %); free time and culture (6,3 %); restaurants and hotels (1,2 %); different goods and services (0,3 %).
The prices fell on clothing and clothing (2.2 %); mobile, budgetary devices and rounding expectations (0.5 %); health (0.1 %).
The prices remained as for months in alcoholic drinks and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuel; communication; as well as education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as asiatic career
Snapchat says that this filter is inspired by Anime, but some observers say that it is unseenable to race.
Filter Tool allows Snapchat around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with efficiency in such a way that is already limited to absurdity.
You can transform yourself into ananas, a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Lightenstein feet.
The filters are inflammable, property-reverse tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All deficiencies reached the public.
Snapchat filters in the past have criticized themselves, where they were accused that the App Blackface would promote or white skin as a beautiful ideal.
When this week a few users suggested a filter that had a slider, false teeth and opened wheels, some critics called a racial career of Asians - "Galb view".
They wondered whether these repeated counterparts showed a greater problem that the company had diversity.
The news and the companion were broadcasts in the middle of the week, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat reported that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered a excuse: the filter was like a hommage of animal characters and not a career of Asians.
But foreigners who have taken the racists have noticed that the filter was a deceitful closure.
Others refused to determine the comparison of animals.
In a e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American artist, whose twot was broadcast over the photos that the filter was "injured and disappointed."
It is difficult to argument the contraception of a very reflective Asian career and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not cool, but that the yellow view was chaired in the extreme extrem.
Snapchat is not the only company that overcomes this cultural stomach.
The culture seems to be developed in an endless war of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchats of the great public of young people - which in the race things are different than their elderly opposers - could be better out of expecting sensibility.
When one of Snapchats filters makes a picture that is prominent for a user, "that is much more weak that such things remain unobserved than before it was the case," said the 25-year Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who as a product manager and engineer for the media to remove its Snapchat account, requested others to do the same.
In an attachment to media and in a phone interview she said that she believed that racial conflicters reflected the lack of diversity in the position of Snapchat labels.
Zhu criticized the white, only men's leadership and ended their approach with a hashday: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Out they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their holding, so they can take such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there, but they are not in positions where they are safe or well to say anything."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that mostly has left Snapchat unresponsibility.
The company does not publish numbers for the diversity of its company and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his workers, but, according to a speaker, the company recently set a personal responsible for subrepresented population groups and for internal integration efforts.
Zhu said on her side that she would leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not OK."
Military management wrongs ISIS secret service information, establishes the Congress Committee
The United States Central Command military citizens changed post-service information in order to make a more optimistic picture of the war against the islamic state in Iraq and in ́em as they would have allowed the real states in place, a Congress investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, established by a Task Force of the Republican members of the District Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Budget Committee, reported of a great incompatibleness under Central Command Secret Service Analysis, which reported how their assessments were changed on the efforts of combating the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military main quarter in Tampa, Florida, which controls the military operations in the Near East and Central Asia.
"Information of newspapers, which were typically denied by high-range Centcom committees, regularly had a positiveer picture of the Ananian efforts against terrorism than the actual states were allowed and were more positive than the analysis of other news services," a periodic article cited the report.
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, the Republican member of the representative House, stated.
The leader errors in Centcom are to the top of the organization.
The lateral report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the Iraqian efforts in the training of the Iraqian conflict forces.
Although there is no direct indication of the fact that governments under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how the analysts seemed to look forward to the pressure of their proposals, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, including ISIS or ISIL.
"In the first half year 2015, many Central Command Press-Seminars, opinions and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts." The report stated.
For example, a Centcom official said that a military rearrangement Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"Near months of investigation, it is so clear." Mike Pompeo, the Republican Congress Deputy from Kansas, said in a opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the heads of the Central Command changed the post-service reports to play the ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were joined that the analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed recognitions while the investigations are continued.
Additionally, further Centcom's reviews are reported by the General Inspector of the Defence Minister in the past.
The Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own recognition on Thursday, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a excessive restricted process for the creation of post-service assessments on ISIL and the Iraq security services," said the highest democracy in the committee, member of the representative House Adam B.ship, in a opinion.
This process, as Mr. ship, "after the publication of post-service reports," hurt the moral under analysts and "increasingly few spaces for different opinions."
But Mr. ship and the democrats have not found any evidence of the accession of the White House to the Centcom Analysts on a "determined political opinion".
The provisional results of the congress investigations were published on Sunday by the Daily Beast.
In the last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which were recorded after Centcom Analysts.
Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in a opinion that the Defence Minister would not comment on the Congress reports while the investigations of the General Inspector were still in the past.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have different opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Defence Minister welcome a controversal debate of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have effects on the issue of an aircraft campaign in Iraq and besides the Iraq (a claim made between a growing number of members of the Defence Minister).
However, the accusations of the past year have been addressed to the question how President Obama can leave the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State refers to sciences of more than a year ago, when a Centcom Anal, Gregory Hooker, was a letter about how the Government under George W. Bush received the recommendations of many analysts in Iraq and had a little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in resisting the current report on the Islamic State.
In the past year, Mr. Hooker's team stated by government institutions that the statements of the Government against the raffiners held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the funding of the terrorist group, since these provisional raffiners had been operated in order to overcome oil on the black.
However, this recognition was not published, reported by the Times in September.
Centcom's then commanded officer, Mr. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of its excessive positive assessment of wars in a hearing before the senate.
General Austin went to the rest in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
The United States win the fourth match in the fieldhockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain is before
One day after she had shot three doors during a 6-1-year-bye over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the Ananian fieldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five Tore in two games should represent a thoughtful performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember what they had ever done.
"I don't know." She said.
I don't belong to those who keep their gates in memory.
However, they know that the Americans lie at 4-0 in the Olympical Wet War and are at the same time in their group with the British in the first place that remains insulted after their 2-0 winning against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first parties.
Both communities have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will be decided which two in their group of six teams will reach the first and second place.
The first place is going to take the strong neighbourhood a little longer out of the way that leads the other group.
As well as the game may come on Saturday, the Americans have solved a surprising wire through their success, four years after they landed at the past London Games on the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time three years of hockeys in hands (their two elderly sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), 16 years old, she became the US National Player, the youngest in the history of the team.
She lost the olympiade in 2008, since she couldn't qualify for the frame.
Then the year 2012, where everything was shifted for her and her team.
In the next year, Parnham, an English, Tra > the National Team, began to turn the things to be better.
"A culture change, a mental exchange and a body exchange," said Bam.
We didn't have the workshop in London that we had now.
We've been able to run the ruder completely.
In the morning, Bam opened the towers in the first half of the game with a backup from the neighborhood.
India was going to the game without victory, but the team showed himself surprisingly tears and held the game state from 1-0 to the fourth, until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flat, then moved to the middle and sprinkled the ball into the gate to make the Americans a 2-0 flight.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tourner for the United States tourist, Jackie Briggs, who had to buy a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position", said Parnham, but how well it will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
Meanwhile the Olympical Games, the Zen of Trampolis
Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inevitable, a racial staff run between competition and efforts.
It is like the olympical fakkel himself would be a burning stab that is reached by the brainbrust to the swimming to the tourner to the triathlet.
You can't enable the televisor to read a magazine or talk to your neighbor in the coffee shot, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley still.
Dooley, who is the first time in the Olympics games and is a female weight with grapes, could be through these names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-faith TV work if he was a swimming, tourner or even a feet.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in olympic trampolin tours for gold.
The olympical flame does not light any event equal.
Moreover, partly in the shadow, the sports types are not generally recognised: air pistolen shots, bowling shots, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the brush and let's rule it for a long time.
But if I have to make senseless arguments for my loved one, let me take attention to the discrete charm of the trampolis.
Although the trampolin springs have been a olympical event since 2000, when it had his debt in Sydney, the last 16 years were so carefully realized that many of the people I asked didn't know that it was a olympian port.
This may also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent Athletes to the fight, it has never won a medaille in the trampolin pools and has had a atlete that has created it until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians are concerned to share the prices for men and Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will protect their gold medaille from London this year.
The trampolin spring has a certain external charm, partly because it is more suitable for the unexpected ear for a clown school than for the Olympics Games.
In this place, I should admit that I am not a expert but only an enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonable tissue of his never desired appreciation - but also the thanks to the tour and touchance, the two sports types that are essentially united.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much as "Sp'brett".
Strengthening winners run on a gigantic trampolin, shoot almost 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements (three, feet and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They will be evaluated as official olympia program after execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Twenty-third atletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will attack one another in Rio.
The most common olympical vector is just out.
Median hopes have to continue to go to gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes go and back, up and down on the game.
They follow not only the target line or the output wall, but also in television transfer another homosexual goal: the world's or the olympical corner.
The target-oriented stress is noble, amazing, even fanatic - and it's enough to even touch a viewer to trees.
But that's also what I feel like when looking at these games as something embarrassing.
That's what the trampolin offers an atmosphere.
The vector of the trampolin camper is upstairs.
A preliminary movement is not the objective.
He or she goes out, it seems unfortunately like a astronaut, goes up, then down, then slowly back up.
There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wildness in the remote, only the dreaming, elegant decline of time and gravity.
It is just like Zen like competition in the Olympics games.
The women's qualifications and enduring will be placed on Friday after midnight, in the streaming at 13.00 East Time; the men also on Saturday at 13.00.
NBC will strike the ends as part of a afternoon block at two days from 14.00.
Meanwhile, they promise a hard, good moment, one who will probably be reviewed in the general tumult.
If the increasing consciousness can only be achieved by the advice and objection of men's athletes - as the men of the US tourner suggested the Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his calling for air, new prisoners.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long a United States
Violent active protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators who request political changes in Ethiopia have stripped against the government's violent opposition.
The Witnesses say that 10 protestants were killed during the meeting with the police in switch.
Is Ethiopia just to break together?
In recent years, it was one of the most stable African countries, a solid west associate with a fast growing economy.
But in the past months, protests against the Government supported the country, and they were increasingly in more areas.
Last week, thousands of people struck on the streets and requested fundamental political changes.
The response of the Government was obviously unbarmable for human rights organizations.
The Witnesses showed that the police shot and killed zig unarmed demonstrators.
In the course of videos about the protests that are probably from the beginning of this year, show how youths have been shot with stones, while they were forced to make a handstock against a wall.
The Chief of the United Nations Auditors for Human Rights now requires an incoming investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and futurely will be more weak," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the African Horn of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populating country of Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by Western.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, in general, receive so much western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy expanded in a significant time.
His infrastructure has been drasticly improved - there is a new pendler travel in the main city Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually slow, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was all other than an example of democracy - human rights organizations have continued to be stressed by the Government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, where dissidents have been effectively weak.
They were sent to the exil or to the prison, killed or cast into the winters of the wilderness.
But that could change.
"If you press people and these options have no other options except to protest," said Seyoum Teshome, a dog in Central Ethiapies.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are many challenges that cover everything from the land-use to the dealing with regard to the power of the regional coalition.
After a long-termly criticized choice last year, the Governing Party and its associates received the last seat of opposition and now checked up 100% of Parliament.
At the same time, the spendings increased near the border to Eritrea; a battle for this sack-conflicted line requested hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts ensure that separatists such as the Oroma-free front or the national release front of Ogaden, who have been more or less convinced, could use the turbulences and weapons again.
Several people explain why the feelings of destruction are exploded after years of the prejudice under the surface.
The first seems harmless: artphones.
In the past years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, since billiger artphones were always more frequent and the Internet services improved.
Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does in regular circumstances, especially in protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxys that hide where they stop.
Many young Ethiopians suggested that they were assembled to protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between the Ormos and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia.
The Oromas and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Yeones, the Amharas, coming from Ethiopia, prospered in the area and economic, while exploiting the Oromos from which many muslims are and live in flachland areas.
But that's just changed.
"We are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromas.
The largest protests were located in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is inevitably dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which are approximately 6% of the population and are dominant in military, secret services, trade, and.
The reason for the injuries is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, an ancient rebellious leader, was until too death at a non-publicated disease in 2012 17 years of the Ethiopian Prime Minister.
He was seen as a tactic genius, a man who could think of the ears.
Analysts say that he was especially deceived in maintaining early signs of uncomfortableness and using special agents to edit enemies and make them unfair.
"The current regime fails to this basic chick," said Mr. Abdi, a conflicttanalytic.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively untransparent reasons to introduce Mr Meles' position.
Otherwise than Mr Meles, coming from the North-Ethiopy region, Mr Hayelemariam from the south.
Analysers say he doesn't enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.
See that the result will be more blood loss.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a rebellion was 2005, after thousands of people protested against elections, which seemed to have been cut down by the government and then slaughtered.
In the following divisions, many protestants were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of disasters was relatively quick.
Ethiopia's experts praised their visional infrastructure planning, such as the new penalty course, and their measureable progress in poverty.
But this, obviously, has not prevented the intensification of the internal misfortune of the Ethiopic Government.
And she takes an equivalent ethnic form.
Last month Protestants attacked businesses conducted by Tigray in Gondar, a Amharian city, and the hatred against Tigray becomes more usual in the social media.
Analysers say that the protests bring the United States and other western associates into a own position.
The Government of the Ethiopians used as a base for drone flights over the neighbouring Somalia, even though she recently informed that she had closed this base.
When westerns are clearly want to submit the democracy, he does not want his associates to join in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very dark graduation."
Donald Trump explains his appreciation Obama has created ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to spread the last controversy around his campaign on Friday, indicating that his multiple repeated opinion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been seriously the "grounds" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
This clarification raised new issues on the ability to communicate with the President's agenda of the Republicans whether it is able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the public.
It also brings his partners who strive to protect him during an eventual phase, in the own position, to declare statements that he could not have made.
After he had made the exemption in a middlewovening campaign, Mr Trump returned to the statement on Thursday and was in interviews that he really did not consider that the President and Mrs Clinton would have created ISIS.
But in a early morning twice on Friday, Mr. Trump said he's just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr Trump said in a series of interviews he thought the accusation was completely serious.
When the Conservative Radio Moderator Hugh Hewitt Trump wanted to help Mr. Trump reject the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama ISIS wanted to break out, the Republican presidential candidate would not know anything about it.
The last storm of the critical storm is running down on Mr Trump while he tried to focus his campaign because of the falling inquiry values to the economic sets.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about economies in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Looking on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to taxes and that he had long-termly found their talks.
Mr. Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defence.
The end of July he took strong criticisms when he thought the Russian should hack Ms. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I mean the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the language limits in the area and then to go back after need.
"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans will be recorded, as they come, and then, where appropriate, "claim" after the reaction occurs." Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is smart enough to keep his statements fair enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of disturbing the sound for the presidential elections, Mr Trump adopted a more eating sound, since its values have continued to be returned.
A new question of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leader with a great prespect in the North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-and-heading rounds in Florida.
Since Mr. Trump is generally trying to not excuse for his provocated expressions, he often accuses his critics to disappoint his statements or to understand his humor wrong.
But while he is focusing on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Sherze has brought his loyal fellow members into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, independent of how to be caused by his statements.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former citizen master of New York and one of the Trumps prominent speakers, was a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the rightness of Mr. Trumps' statements whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton would have found the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS, he was almost unknown, small organization, he called her interbinkers, perfectly wrong, and it happened because he dropped the people out of Iraq.
Most stream Republicers try to argument that the government under Obama, who served as a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by providing the situation aggressively under control in the Near East.
Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and foretold them to run on each of his words and to be predicted against him.
He prevented the "poor, worrying" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the democrates disputed Mr Trump's excuses as only another evidence that he was inappropriate to the President's office.
Once wearing the price from the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shadow coffee in Williamsburg, where only a bar could be paid, which had no Wi-Fi, but for 15 years a good coffee.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were distracted.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the verb in Sommer 2014, replaced Sife in the form of Cupcakes.
Inheimians believed that it was the last loss in a gentle town.
Artist Molly's bapple wrote on Twitter, "I know that New York is a change, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead, except the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a shift business."
But if New York is a change, it's a new finding.
A repeated Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than one milk northly of originating place.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but has still some of the same employees and a similar painful atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-year worker of the old cafés, the owner and business leader of the new cafés.
He started working at Verb 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outside, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, had a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bags to buy the same expressomachine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new addictions.
On the food card there are sandwiches with speck and chess and there are garnations such as coppers and salted birds.
There are natural travel shoes.
The coffee doesn't serve beer anymore, there are fresh shirts.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a permanent power at old tribe points.
"Several old customers were also distracted by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived early in Williamsburg and regularly visited the Verb.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I was aware that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb which I had," she said.
Now she drinks again coffee, even though she has ordered a blankend Chai Tea, which is another new added on this day instead of her habitual Iced coffee.
Tom Rosenthal has been a more long-year and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before the work, and always commanded the same.
"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss taschenhour and they prepare my everything bottle with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new additions into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bag with speck, eggs and cakes.
Rodriguez said he didn't believe that the business had taken the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie were invited to make a special seif for verb with the cold coffee of the coffee.
"I think we're still going on her boat," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional, Poland inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the food card to the Polish and Rodriguez said he intended to make it quickly so that his new neighbors would be welcomed.
The location also has further advantages.
A local saft-local wants to fill and surface the cold coffee in the flash.
There is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building.
For many customers, there is a new verb to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a tribe and said he was broken on the ground when the coffee finished.
When the new coffee opened, Whitt said that the presentation of the local and order of a new coffee felt like a home.
"I had to ride it," he said.
The depressive eating of the economic crisis in "a rich food"
In March 1933, shortly after the chairman was raised, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his summer in the Oval Office.
As a fine mecker, President Roosevelt had a low for raffined delicts of the Fifth Avenue like Pâte de fue gras and Maryland water-shirt supper.
His menu on this day was something wise: Eggs in Tomatesauce, Cartofels and as desert a plant pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
"Their husband Andrew Coe was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The marriage is in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" worked by the Chinese kitchen in the United States, while Zegelman said in his book "97 Orchard" about life in a wellhouse at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest co-operation, "A strict feeding time", which will appear on Thursday in Harper Travel, illustrates the story of the cuisine of the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter in Iisenberg's Sandwich Shop at the evening, a small, scarceless imbiss in the Flatiron District, which is already in business since Börsencrash 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordained a fresh-sessweech with olive sticks, while Coe, 57, eating the cup with cartoffles and mealing.
When reporter Hackbraten commanded, this couple found a discussion on food in the time of the great depression.
"The rich foods were very poor," said Zegelman.
There were earth's bread, liver boxes and bohnen bread.
They were prepared from a sustate and a little bit that stretched the soat.
Imagine to eat so many earthquakes that they serve them as dinners.
Coe's gone.
"It must have been put into the magic like bleed," he said.
In the years before the great depression, the table was in a household, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can Eat Buffet.
Women's families cooked for men's field workers, and it was served freshly backed past for breakfast, breakfast and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" opens the ways that the country went through.
"It was a time in which the eating for the Americans became a central, relaxed topic," Coe claimed why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was also stressed: secret foods such as bread and casseroles were made to the basic feeds, the casseroles as "wonderful species, revaluation of food residues", noted the cooking, since the cook was able to hide unpetitive additives under a creaming sauce.
The fresh fruit was replaced by a big smoking fruit.
Meat, which was the center of the cuisine in the year, became a rare serving luxus.
Certain mixtures have been tested because a caloriesian and nutrient satisfaction had a priority for the swimming or even healthy kitchen understanding.
In the interest of their search for the book, which also includes recipients, the bottleman prepared a court from this epoch, backed doubles with earthbutters.
"There was no popular addiction in the middle," said Coe.
"It was surreal."
Earth butters and backed dubbles do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recepts.
As never before or since, budgetary economys, including Louise Stanley, leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943, thus followed the country's habits.
By publishing receptions and articles in magazines and magazines, they encouraged women to become "coherent policies" and to be justified by the challenge of converting pamps like creamed spaghetti with carotes into cocktail feeds.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical leckers.
The reports on the response of the Government to the hungry citizens such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-Mich Kuchen Essen-Health.
Since he praised the simple Iowa Bauerhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he enjoyed as the millions of people of the world to whom he has become.
"He loved continental kitchen like fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe.
He was eating in a almost coated food room and wearing a smoking.
He was a glorious reality foreigner.
President Roosevelt may have made the same error if his wife Eleanor had not invited him to set an example with magen.
As described in the book, a householder with no interest in smiling directions by Mrs. Roosevelt made the White House the longest food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortable prepared."
Property of the species from the era of the great depression, to run with food, was disrupted as soon as the country returned to the feet.
The consciousness is on our continued focus on the calories and Nah, said the bottleman, as well as on how the use of the nutrition was applied to Nah food.
The couple had better understanding the food habits of the Greekman's mother - for example, how she couldn't remove food.
"You had a real rate before the disorder of food," said Coe.
Zegelman warned, "You actually made people sick."
There's been the wind-building accident.
After the Talers at Iceenberg's was released, they and Coe showed a dessert that they had prepared home: the plant engineer, which President Roosevelt eat at midnight.
"It's called Prune Whip," said the guyman and fêe to add that it was a usual trick to adjust a famous recept to a sending name.
There was no slaughtered thing, only plants, something meal, sugar, water and circles.
Everyone put something contrary to a lobster in the wheat, green glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn't hurt badly.
Coe took a trip three times.
Like a Can-Do Budgetier, he said to his wife, "A few hacked whales would help."
He was the Held of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the Held of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old himself died at a fassbomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, who was aware of the picture-setting of almost 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own lives on the game to take people out of broken houses and help first in the war area.
You're the heirs of the war.
Omar was the vision of the group: A video of the civilian, showing him in a 11-hour salvation of a childhood from the dreams of a house, went around the world.
It made the Syrian a lighting symbol in the grid of the war.
But when he had never seen himself, he said: "This is the real Jihad for me."
"If I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself had attacked the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks.
The helicopters had four fass bombs over the Alzadia Bezirk, one with Chlorgas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer atmosphere.
"We now remove the toxic residues of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the image quotes his last words before he died.
The dead bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest wild animal is almost 400 years old
That's a rare look.
Greenland hairs are mostly in the winter to the top area.
This hair returned to the sea after an investigation on the board of the Sanna Research Board.
He was born 1624 and weeped with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland hairs are born only with 150 years of adults.
The Greenlandhai is swimming at the ground of the North Atlantic, in one hour he comes in the average of 20 metres away.
Only when it comes, the five meters long the animal is set on 2.6 km/h and is half as fast as a robot.
This long-term lifestyle, however, seems to be a patentercept for a high age.
Julius Nilsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the Scientific magazine "Science" at any time by a Greenlandhai which could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck Institute for Demography Research in Rostock, this lifestyle, which means a well-treeword for animals.
So the evolution biologist thought that Greenland has been stoned for a long time.
They just missed the evidence.
Greenland hairs are difficult to be observed, and they live in the isismers, especially before the coasts of Canadian, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergs.
Because they prefer water temperatures about the six degrees Celsius, they are mostly in the winter.
The Greenland's lifestyle does not know the researchers accordingly.
They measured their time time when they placed six animals before Spitzbergs with a sender.
However, these hairs do: In the magic of a animal, researchers found the rest of a robbe, another had cut off the kitchen bones of a young iron.
Perhaps they can go sleeping animals or patrol on the basis of the iceman and search for Kadaver, which turn down from water looks.
Julius Nilsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenlandhai, which took the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergs as a contribution from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest hair was just 81 centimeters long, while the maximum 502 centimeter was measured.
To discover the age of animals, they analyzed the hair linsectors with the 14-metode.
This centre of the eyelines is already occurred before the birth of the hae, which contains proteins, will not be renewed later.
The two smallest hairs had a lot of carbon 14 in the linsean.
Therefore, their birth should be followed after the early 1960s, as atomic weapons trials, increased amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the 220 centimetres longest animal, however, the Linsenkers contained a small overview of carbon 14 from the atomic weapons trials, so it had to have been made its 50th birthday during its study in 2012.
However, all larger greenland hairs in their linsean corners had normal carbon 14 miles, which occurred by cosmical radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 hours for a 493 centimetres long greenlandhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record hashi with 502 centimeters of 392 years of age.
The Greenlandhai women were born only when they were longer than four meters.
Now the longer researchers could arrange an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters had been on the wheel and his age was determined by 156 years, Greenland has apparently increased at least one half centuries.
It must also be well-treeord for animals today.
It is not a case that such mosaic salmons live, especially in the needed warriors.
In addition, the current recorder, a 211-year-old Greenlandwal, in which a 120-year-old harpunence has been arrested before Alaska.
The low temperatures often also run the organism of the living animals in there.
So they're riding later, and older.
To keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often especially large.
Because the volume is much faster than its surface, which includes the animal warm.
Therefore, the warm loss of a gram of mouse is much greater than a gram of elefant.
Another advantage: You have less enemies.
"A smaller animal, so, should be able to make it possible to have many offspring as soon as possible," explains the evolution biologist Schuerlein.
However, a very large animal should invest his resources in a long life.
Double Pack Background
With the subjects around the building, the community's investment at the latest session has severely seen.
With easierness, the Gremium adopted the communication of citizens Robert Putz that "endly the construction of recently designed residence areas can be started".
After claiming the baselines, partitional and solvency issues and allowed to be met, the sale of the basic pieces in the areas of the "strashlweg" and "Sconau-West" (Area Binderstraße - Education Section 1) is not more in the way of interesters.
The community is convinced that the building areas in the rurally designed and solid residents are equal to young families and famous elders.
As it said, building volunteers can report immediately in Rathaus, the community is probably advised at its September session.
In order to be able to comply with additional workshops related to the creation of workplaces, the Community investment decided to change the plan for renewable use in part areas first in the early year of this year.
In the field of submarines, the area of ships already assigned to two parts of State road 2112 is thus extended.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city am ́ then has the best opportunities to bring jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very probably that Frankfurt benefits most of Brexit-Votum," says Michael Voigt countries, leader of the Competitive Field Financial Markets and Immobility Markets of IW.
After the Brexit Referencendum, it is uncertain that money houses can continue from London from financial businesses throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU pass, they have sufficient authorisation in the United Kingdom.
It's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced to reduce jobs.
The Lobby unit "Frankfurt­ Finance" calculates 10000 new jobs within five years.
For Frankfurt, such as the IW, the Site of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for money policy and the supervision of the largest banks of the Eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as EIOPA and the risk Council.
In Paris, the organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) has its main seat, but it is less important for the financial industry than the ECB.
"The approach to the note bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the attention," says IW Vogue Country Professor.
Although Luxembourg has a large fund industry, it is also a degree of the Dublin in the infrastructure.
Frankfurt is very easier to achieve the great airport.
Also points the city with easily available carriers.
"In Paris it isn't so easy to find free high-valuable offices," says the Watchtower.
On his own, the premises for first-classic warehouse mobiles were also 50 Pro日 than am.
Frankfurt offers a long quality of life as competition thanks to good health and infrastructure as well as less criminality.
In a ranking of Mercer's business advice, the city stands in place seven, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 37.
Even if life quality is a question of the preliminary, "with its already strong position as a financial position for the Property," Frankfurt could take additional banks and investors," follows the IW.
But, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial area in Europe as the economic researchers.
For this reason, the powers are also stated: in London, according to the numbers of the Helaba Bank, about 144,000 people in the bank industry, in Frankfurt were 62500.
Gilead receives rights from the hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
A US officer discovered that Gilead Sciences Inc has an advice on the restitution of the laws which have occurred from the Hepatitis C legal fight with the Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a damage payment of $200 million for the damage of two patents of Merck, which were related to the Blockbuster medicals Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US leader discovered a pattern of misbehavior from Mercks, \ Myeides and other unethical actions.
At the exhibition of the complaint on Thursday, U.S. Deputy officer Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has an appropriation of the costs that have occurred during the defence of the case.
Merck tries to equivalent to Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90% of patients with lever disease.
The case returns to 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained each other and took property on lab work, based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
The United States supported troops say that they have restored complete control on Manby from the Islamic State
The United States supported troops returned the full control over the north town Manby near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city left them, a speaker of the group said on Friday.
The Democratic forces (DKS) are running after the resting group of battles who have entered the city are currently buried.
They delivered more than 2.000 civilians held by the battles as prisoners, Sharfan Darwish shared the Manby Military Council Re¤s associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we're just running through cleaning," he said Reʹs.
Clintons deserve 10,75 million in 2015 and pay 34,2% of the taxes of the bank
Hillary Clinton published its tax clothes for 2015, which granted an income of USD 10,75 million and an effective rate of 34,2% for the presidential agenda of the Democrats and their husband.
In 2015, Clinton's USDs spent 1 million for well-being purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton developed almost 5,3 million USD in Redehonorers; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the Company Simon & Schuster for her book about their office in the outer ministerial.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published together with his wife Anne Holton his tax declarations in the last years.
They paid an effective rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to put standards on financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a opinion.
In a crazy contrast, Donald Trump is hidden behind false exposures and backwards in relation to its promises before public his tax declarations.
It is usually to publish their tax declarations for US presidential candidates, although they are not committed by law.
Trump, a New Yorker businessman, and his advocates have given as a reason for refusing a tax check by the tax officers.
"You're on the move," wrote Clinton's election campaign Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential calendar of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Advisers, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to make something too public before tax checks are completed.
Trumps Critiker, including the Republican presidential agenda of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made aware that his refusal of abilities, its S ́s for well-being organizations, its businessable and different connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already publised a video on the Internet on Friday, where the high-ranging Republican Trump invites his taxing clothes to publish.
On Thursday, she also spoke to the subject during a talk about the economic in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last years and to publish its tax declarations." she said to the multitude.
Politico reported that Trump has not paid any or only very few taxes during the 1990s, and a new York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax advocates and tax advisers that indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the choice fight.
Clinton supports a scheme called after the billion and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that persons who are more than 1 million USD deserve a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
In the last week of the week in Omaha, Nebraska requested buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Industrie Conglomerate here has his seat to turn the Trump to a meeting to their tax declarations.
Buffett said he had also been undergone a tax check of the IRS and Trump had "angst" before the electors and not before the tax members.
Clinton's campaign has published taxer clothes back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid in the average an effective federal taxation of approximately 32% between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective combination of approximately 40.5%.
The fiscal clothes of the Clintons of 2015 showed that they only used USD 100 of their income as a loan, other than the majority of all Americans.
Its main money facility was a free index fund, from which the Clinton's dividends and rents of USD 109.000 were charged.

Condoms with Chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzanias Elefanten protection
Natural in Tanzania uses an unorthodox nature to stop the elefants from going into people's dwellings - they throw condoms on them that are with Chilipuder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which has been the idea for years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the US natural protection by training volunteers in northern Tanzanias to use a violent quarter-situation method to protect their homes and herds without preventing animals.
Before, many speeds have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is the world's living day, which is designed to protect animals.
"Several since we have developed this ... Toolkit, we could see a change in these communities, whereas they are much more convinced that they can stop the elephants from their fields without hurting the elephants," said the business leader of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include the light of the elephant with a fashion and blassing in a corner.
If he is not scared, a so-called "Chiliwolke" will be made.
Chilipuder mixed with the earth is packed together with a firework body in a condom with its end to the bleeding.
When it is burned, the condom is placed up with a cloud and sprinkles fine smoke on chilipuders into the air.
A hook is usually already out to hurt the elefants.
One of the last opportunities represents a prosecutor who shoots a golden round firework in the air and causes a sound, light explosion.
City Council concludes only: No kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinfer
Normally, the St. Goarer takes investment projects from carriers with cousshand - but the individual trade in the nuclear city is clearly developable.
The request for the rebuilding of a purchases at the rainfer in the nearby of the Rhein Ballon in the building has now rejected the city Council.
"We welcome new drivers, but in this place in exposed position on the rock, this kiosk does not match," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
The Jewish Governor broke Berliner Hotel because the Israelite preference was removed by "Arabic" request - RT News
A French Governor with Jewish worth determined a medium upstairs after he had delivered that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israelian preference, since the Arabian guests would have been "requested."
Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah", released his distress in Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing a open letter to the German magazine FAZ.
With his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the country pre-elect list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible for Israel to be eliminated and removed in 2016 in Berlin, the capital city of the new Germany?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel through a own call center.
Following a clothing, the ruler turned to the hotel receipt.
The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employer said that the measure was a "absolute decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels".
The reason that was behind was more wounded in the ruler.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the preference be deleted," was quoted by Lanzmann's employee.
The Israeli messenger in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the South German journal.
We were disappointed and fair of this event.
This is really very confusing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a greater shame.
It doesn't need any clothes.
We expect the hotel "the right conclusions," said the officer.
The incident solved a pretty large resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole scandal.
Some submit to Kempinski Hotel that it would have "invited" the famous requests of Arab guests.
"Shomme Euch," it said in another contribution, in which it was indicated that the hotel, located at the noble Kurourstendamm, is near a synagoge.
The hotel quickly showed all the accusations of himself and called the case a "proof" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reported the Spiegel.
"It was never a direct instruction," Israel did not enter the choice list," quoted the South German magazine a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It is the fact that the country's pre-selection is now given.
Police includes Gas & Gummichoses against protesting Brazilian students
Students gathered together on Thursday in the Brazilian city Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered themselves to demonstrate the reforms of the Government for the public education system.
The police placed train gas and rubbers against the demonstrators.

With the derogation of the sanctions, the Russian messenger in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade summary between Moscow and Teheran in comparison with 70.9 Pro.
Since international sanctions have been rejected against Iran, the interest in Russian companies has grown strongly in business in the country, the proclaimer shared.
Russian companies take existing connections to Iran while new companies are ready to provide access to the market.
Of course, the next trade building is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that the trade summary between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 Pro · compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In addition, the Russian imports to Iran increased up to 91.5 Pro¤pro¤score and covered $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 Pro > 158 million dollars.
Trade upbuilding has been reached by delivery of machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the proclaimer.
Dzhagaryan is a record of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
The last year, the Russian foreign refund was approximately 35.000 visas, in the first line, to the Iranian citizens.
Moreover, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries, regarding the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the records of Iranian tourists in Russia have been breaked last year, " he said.

Searched Witnesses: Greenhouse in Waldbreol
A raw transition has been carried out on the tree of Rewe XXL on the woods on the wooden road.
Under the preservation of a shot weapons, three darkly clothed persons who had conceived their faces requested the exemption of money from the employee of the tree and then fled to the foot and then with a silver colored VW-golf.
How much money was used, the police doesn't share.
The tissues must have been between 1,60 and 1,70 metres large, so relatively small.
The tree is directly accessible and wrongly equivalent from the park of the Rewe market.
The tissues must be drawn in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and the shotter park place with the silver colored car, possibly in direction B 256 (scaderring).
He who has made observations relating to the raw accident (on 19.45 hours) must be reported urgently to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer free time

Haggerloch: Arrows for the pit of mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St.
Jointly, four steps were established.
In order to overcome the time to the next rowal of all ministers in probably two years, the Superminister Round of St.

16 The ministers of the pool, the green, the hairlock, and the sanctuary came on the way.
In the evening before, Pfarrer Storost sent the pilgrims in a small festival in St.日, blessed the arrow cross and distributed the pilgrim.
From Horb was driven by train at the beginning point of Villingen, where also a Münster Our loved woman is and so the pilgrim was attacked by the Münster.

The deserved recompense was a common grill at the badweer evening.
After the morning impuls on the fourth pilgrim of St. Peter's implanted Closter Church, it went to the clusset cappe to Freeburg.
Seeingly easier and happy, the Minis entered the Friburger Münster later afternoon and progressed in the poet of mercy.

Shotte Callum Skinner shoots home when Brite Gold reached for Radsports
Scotland Callum Skinner was last night in the man team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself own. The young man made the legend stolt when he struck home to win a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
In England, four years ago, a shocking winning, while today got the fifth of six olympiagold metals.
They repeated the trick after they had only a small sixth place in the travel townships in London, despite the retreat.
The problem between Peking and London was the substitution of the leader Jamie Staff.
They did this rightly as an hind.
Today's silence produced a luck to try to close Kian Emadi and Matt mpton.
Skinner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the shot, which has now occurred.
Hindes, Kenny, who were seen with today four years ago - and skinners put a olympical order in the qualification areas, but in the standard areas, the new countries pointed out in the first part.
And the British Trio won the duell with gold.
Hindes was nearly back after his wedding, but Kenny followed the team before and Skinner held it.
A change in the process made a large part of the transformation, at which the hinde went into a rough course to relent him and allow it to Keny and, especially, to keep the time.
Today he looked out of his position as a BBC expert and fell skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they went up to the potest.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glassgow said, "It's a smileful comparison."
I'm just here to do my chair and make me a name.
We have set up a olympical corner in the end, and we have seen the world masters.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at Kennys and Hoys, Hindes told that after a weak start, he fell to the train.
He returned this statement later, and there was no engaging in England's rivals.
In such a surprising victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels with all the GB flags on the tribe like London."
We've been together in the last three months as a team.
We had so many world titles so bad that it was incredible to win again in the Olympiade.
This is a event, a golden medaille for the nation, which has been won seven of 10 titles both in Peking and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect five days in the velodrum.
With the form of Kennys, it is possible that he wins today of three olympical gold metals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - which is exactly 12 years older than today, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for the British Sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister was born) - an extent of six gold medals and a silver medaille.
It's the same thing of today.
Kenny takes the next part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old of Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
Something feels simple to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two other golden meals, he should be shot to the rider."
It was the only medical requirement of the day, but there were more news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed ́ncy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualities had the fastest performance in the four-four-km rounds.
They arrived at 3:51,942 at the goal.
The well-tree word won in London Gold in 2012 was at 3:51,659.
The first and final (22.42) is located today on the second day of the competitor, where Wiggins will be focused.
He had passed with officers yesterday before the qualification when he was calling functionary to measure his body size.
In the corresponding female legislation, which is continued and completed tomorrow, advanced Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie at 4:13,260.
The GB team leaves his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics games and get a scar on medalans.
After a real exceptional presentation of absolute domination in Peking and London, the expectations for Rio were lost.
The dramas were played in the background, thus the return of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexism and mobbing and the rest of sizes such as today and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it seems like the current legendary call of GBs, which has reached its higher point at the perfect moment, would be repeated.
The future of Portland's smeltery will be questioned due to the derogation of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland's Aluminium breakfast in Victoria - and hundreds of workplaces of employees - are on the game because the investment operators declare the energy supplier contract and will thus revoke all delivery contracts, as reported by the underlying energy enterprises.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to forgive any further subsidies for the operation of the installation.
A subsidie set for 20 years shall be executed in November.
Up to 2000 workplaces in the Alcoa facility in Portland are on the game.
Not less than 2000 workplaces - direct and indirect - could be able to be closed.
Moreover, it could be the effects of the Dominie, since the smelzery consumes about 10% of the entire electricity production of Victorias.
2014 Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzerie, which led last year to a closement of the powerwork.
Alcoa's smiley in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the annual speculate regarding the future of the installation, originally as a result of the strong equacy and adequately due to the electricity price for the installation.
AGL, who delivers the large Alumi’s cup with Loy Yang A powerwork in Latrobe Valley, shared that it seemed that three other owners would be announced to their contracts.
The installation is in the majority of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp holds smaller shares.
"AGL suggests that the installation in Portland will continue to be carried out, which means a further physical request for electricity through the smelzery," the company shared.
AGL continued to explain that the contracts as such as "backup businesses" were to enter into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month announcement period, so they will end 2017.
"The AGL therefore determines that the contracts in the 17th business year will be taken into account for the income," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on the income on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the prognoses of the strong term markets for high-treatment prices.
AGL shared that the value of the contracts has already been recorded in the annual end of $187 million in the " expectation of an announcement".
Alcoa said that the decision to buy the contracts, "Alcoas ability to operate the shadow or to ensure electricity supply" does not affect.
The US undertaking said that it had concluded a 20-year-old contract with Loy Yang which would have been in force since November this year, even if it was still eligible for the reasons that it had been revoked from the Treaty.
Analytics warn because of the bad economic conditions of the branch before the possible closing of the Portland Schmelzerie in Victoria and the Tomago installation near Newcastle.
With regard to the statements of the analytical beginning of the week, the head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 Megawatt and Tomago every year around 900 Megawatt.
If both installations disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction of the application on the [strom ·].
And it wouldn't be good for us as electrical producers," he said.
More than only a Kardashian Reality-TV-Star, Kendall is on the cover of the output of September of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Manager and mother of Kardashian Jenner Cris is on the cover of the requested September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the Marken Bootsman of Estee Lauder and walked on the Fashion Weeks in Mayland, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I loved, I was looking at this covers to wine," Kendall wrote.
The enth holding of the Covers followed a bizarre (or simply Kee Upp with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video, which shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (excluding the problems of Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz-oncles and products of Kee-up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends with a classic change: they have all planned a surprising party.
This constitutes the clues captured action nearly every birthday episode of a child's sentence (Seacrest said, "You thought we had forgotten you?", with the honestity of a graphical cancer on a sender at 8 hours tomorrow), but Kris had to let her other girls share any way in this publicity.
With regard to the output of September of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun with certainty.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes what the Vogue-Cover said ( she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a ligue for herself.
The issue of September is for Vogue die am most acquired of the year.
With a range that is earlier compared to an imageband than a periodic magazine, the big number of public operators (Laut Fashionists were from the 832 pages of the waller 615 pages of publicity).
The enthing of his Coverstars is so sensitive that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine were checked before the official notification.
Women already on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In the past years, it was obvious that more "experiences, models" were than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar-prise officer and Dior-Marker Bootsman Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even in the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "Durchbruch model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These famousnesses are not associated with famous persons or reality Stars or youths today who know how to rotate a snapchat video (and if all of it fits on Jenner).
They're really talented women who're in the chat industry.
Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had published Lemonade one of the most recent years of their care.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV stories, Jenner's position was always stressed in the world.
In June, the only Victoria's secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the mistake of the moment".
These feelings cooked again when the message with the Jenner's appearance came out on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to pass on the crime.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue issue of September.
She is a super model in the real sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes publicity for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters overcome pictures of themselves on their relevant Pauwall apps.
She's overwhelmed by her pictures of Cindy's daughter at the LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she is in reality TV. It is probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Family rights show 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's assistance needs are rejected annually from the Community's rights, while the broadcast is made to the effects of further funding reductions on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three of the five persons - most of the older persons, immigrants, helpful workers, victims of violence and those who have no means for unrighteous delegations and similar - have been rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
The legal services of the community, which are already exhausted, are prepared for further shortages.
Since June the next year, these laws will be lost for more than 30 Pro ́ their associated means.
The Director of the Communities of Queesland James Farrell said that the last exhibition of the National Association of Communities was concluded that thousands of people were rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only be worse without rejecting the decision of the Federal Government.
"Queensland's community laws are chronicly underfinanced, which means that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with invisible and impressive debts, families that go through trends, workers who have been unrighteously resolved - all of these people have problems of legal type and this exhibition shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
From June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce the resources to 30%, which means that thousands of health needed people from Queensland will be forced to reach their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Advocate-General and Federal Justice Minister and the Senators of Queensland George Brandis to submit these funds immediately, so that people may receive the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the Government has fulfilled its assignment to highlight legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now time to consider the needs of Community laws and their customers and that the Government of Palaštuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign accused after the employee was able to go a weapon
New York: Donald Trumps campaign has been accused of inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leadership for North Carolina in February had sent a shopping weapons to a worker while they were on a Jeep in February.
The case will be described in an appointment, which was submitted in the Middle Week in the Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaigns in this Federal State.
Bordini insisted to have waited for months ago that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that "it would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "take a gun, put his right show finger on the depth, and broke the run in Vincent's kniekehle," Bordini in his accusation.
Following the local and regional campaign management, Bordini concluded that at least four other persons had already made the same experience with Phillip, he gave the accusation.
"The weapons must not be discharged to make damage," advised Bordini.
The accusation comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate solved a resort, when he said that the "Second Amendment People" should take action to the Shoot weapons owners and weapons friends, if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton should be chosen and called judges.
Trump's campaign cleared that the media had made his words out of the context and that he wouldn't be able to make violence.
Boardini's complaint requires damage from the campaign for the damage of concern and Philip for the damage of the body and remaining soulful damage.
Trumps Presse speaker Hope Hicks was not to receive for a opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local poster in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer the campaign's employee.
On calls to consulting companies, innovative Consulting Services, it was not reacted.
The Republican Presidency Kandidate Donald Trump has done a conflicting campaign until now.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Request for countries: lose SPD and CDU
In the existing elections in the Federal Countries of Mecklenburg (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the Governing Parties SPD and CDU.
This reported representative issues of the INSA Research Institute for the "image" Citizen (Fireday).
Since the red-swarm government coalition in the north could be nearly continued, this is not possible by the Berlin environmental values.
In both federal countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have the opportunity to continue to set the Government leader.
In Mecklenburg's prepommers, the SPD was from 35.6 Pro. 5 years ago to 24 Pro.
This is why the party is able to take a look at the CDU that could return to 23 Pro.
The space is bordered between the left and the off.
The left winds on 19 Pro© (previous 18,4 Pro¤), the AfD would first represent with 19 Pro¤% in the landday.
The Green, despite easier losses with 6 Pro© (previous 8,7 Pro©) returned to the severe landday.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country of 3 Pro.
In the Berliner Deputy Choice, the SPD follows the investigation only 23 Pro© (Selection 2011: 28.3 Pro©).
The CDU has only reached 18 Pro日 after 23.4 Pro.
It is still behind the green with 19 Pro© (2011: 17,6 Pro¤), but at the left with 15 Pro¤ (previous 11,7 Pro¤).
The AfD would first be represented in the deputy house with 14 Pro.
The FDP could hope for a return, however, that the pirates would delay the income by 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: First Artphone
Email and Internet in Timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The followers dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster.
The device grew almost a half kilo and was more than four times as hard as a iPhone 5.
It was thicker and greater, so it wasn't good in the hand.
In contrast, it was pretty smart.
The built memory was at the beginning eight megabytes, which would have been available today for about two sealfies with high resolution.
A iPhone is delivered in the meantime with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 communicator" came to the business exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, and it was the first phone.
For a few euros, Liebhaber can purchase the devices still on the Internet, but they come from the stone time of the Internet time.
However, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before on the computer center of Cebit in Hannover as "Office in West Task Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to be sent and received: SMS and emails could also be received by fax.
Even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers, even though quietly quietly.
A computer was available, a digital address book and a electronic calendar.
There was a small antenne, and the phone could be spread like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
Very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a cartoon in Germany was in 2015 at 392 euros.
In August 1996, no one could know that the communicator would become the beginning of the phone phone.
Since then, everything is different.
The smart phones are a success story, even though not for Nokia.
The phone part of the finds experienced an exampleless disaster, was embraced and developed by Microsoft.
The market is governed today by suppliers who have come many later than Nokia.
Always be online, this is today for many people every day.
2015 there were nearly two billion phone users worldwide.
About 1,4 billion devices were acquired on Samsing and Apple only 555 million pieces.
The worldwide exchange with the devices is about 400 billion euros.
This is the good running businesses of the uncommunications providers and telecommunications concerns.
In the area of the artphone, a whole industry has occurred.
The decided cross-up to mass was first beginning 2007, then Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones on the Mac-World.
He speaks three devices in one: a music player, a phone, and a Internet communications, easy to use everything through touch screen.
Apple's winning was started, yet today the iPhone is the most important product of the container.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry who governed the market had the review.
You disappeared, Blackberry has been fighting.
Now the matter has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The artphone is a self-sensitivity 20 years after it has found it.
In the middle today, every German looks 88 times a day at his phone.
"We all have to learn to remove the artphone once," Janina Kugel just said, in the Siemens representation, responsible for the staff.
Permanent accessibility applies in the meantime as a fleet and a blessing.
England must lift the olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and in London, but in the whole country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London, when we conducted a big approach to ensure that all our N's N's and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiade had great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local seats and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will only create 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs, and prepare a final end of young unemployment in the aircraft.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be some who will think that the challenge of the Heathrows extension is too large.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame on the world level.
The Dufflers had injustice 2012 and they will also lie wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overwind, but Heathrow answers every question.
Like the Olympics games Heathrow is a infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Extension is an opportunity to create up to 10,000 new jobs, £211 billion to scientific growth and to leave assets and employment as well as in the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented an billion billion billion investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - the five years followed the world's best airport terminal until T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequent stages of the world.
Now they are ready to provide a low step, which is supported by £16 billion for private investments.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It's time to link this olympical spirit and expand Heathrow and to ensure our future trade and create a power of ability and employment that can be proud to England.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of the Heathrow Boards and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz and Mouse Game" on display blocking
For enterprises who are able to deserve money online by means of one of the software manufacturers trying to handle display blocking, a "catz and mouse game" equal.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display locks on his desktop, published Adblock Plus a blog post where it notified that users could update their filters in the program to block rereaching the social network.
On Tuesday Facebook shared that his desktop supervisor would change the encoding regarding his advertising indicators in order to make it difficult to recognize the part of the Reporting page.
But Adblock announced that there was a new way to handle the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "This kind of Hin-and-Her fight between the open source Community and the environment is already since the finding of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the worldwide largest company for social media has been in the fight is a strong indication for how anxious display blockers have become for the branch.
Using a worldwide sound from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe about 200 million people displaying blocks; almost four times so much 2013.
With 1,03 billion active users each day accessing on Facebook on their mobile enabling devices, the computer 84 Pro of the Facebook advertising entries exhibits.
The company has seen it on display blockers on the desktop PCs because mobile display blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile application for the social network and instagram, a speaker shared.
Advertising on Desktop PCs provides sufficiently large part of income so that Facebook appears to invest such a step as a loan value.
On Tuesday Facebook shared that it would update its "Show Preferences" tool in order to have more controls on people's publicity.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be concerned because they would also block contents on the page that are not public.
"For the users, this is not a positive experience, so we are planning to speak the problem," a Facebook speaker shared in a email communication.
Display blockers are a stupid fund, so we have been able to put more controls in the hands of people in the area of developers such as Ad Preferences.
Women's transfer on Swiss cars in a conscious suicide
The victim was in the middle of the night on the car.
The police calls witnesses after a woman was transferred on a car car in the early morning hours on Thursday at a conscious suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near the morges in Canton Waadt shortly after the midwest.
A woman put it in the dark "in an act of disturbance" on the street and was found by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swissian at the age of 49, who was transferred by several vehicles, a loader, wanted to kill himself.
She died still from the place.
Several drivers have already been taken, but some have not yet been identified, the police said that they and every Witnesses of the event were invited to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, shared Gilles Courtstotter to Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected whether one of the drivers is shown.
Did a meeting be avoidable?
This is something that the State lawyer must decide," said the Court of Justice.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person went in darkness on the car car - was determined that the car vehicles should not go out that a footpasser runs in the middle of the night on the carway, as it was called in the magazine.
Last year, a police officer was released after she had translated and killed a man who was on the A1 in August 2014 near Payern.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and became unconscious on the road, the court agreed.
The Court concluded that the police, who had responded to a call, had been in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was "a perfect exceptional and unpredictable situation", said the judge.
Everyone who has more information about the event on Thursday near Morges should report the police under 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was only resident
The Venus was probably a resident of the projections of a new NASA climate model.
The Goddard Institute for Spacehaltes of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of Tools and Algorithms like those of climate research.
The model was determined to determine whether the Venus could have indicated only ground conditions with its heavy, waterless surface and CO2 dithering atmosphere.
Agencies have previously indicated that the long turn of Venus could be explained by their close atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a dark, earthly atmosphere geha and still turned along.
The model also lighted the topografie of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more thick areas than the earth, but one had enough water and geographical variability to cover life and slip before faster destruction.
The earlier Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 Propé matters.
"In the GISS model simulation, the long turn of Venus exposes its Sunday side nearly two months," said GISS guardian Anthony Del Genio in a pressing report.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a dick shirt clouds, which affects as a rain screen in order to discover the surface from a large part of the sun heat.
The result is average temperatures that some degrees are cooler than the earth today.
The model highlighted a story of Venus that likes evolution, which was formerly convinced by planet researchers.
Although it was at one time probably resident, the Venus was exhibited in a number of billion years -- too hit and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were deceased and their water bath was burned from the ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen was discovered, only a dick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was restored with a deadly effect of tree -- the Venus, as we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy comes back as a tragedy of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a Tra's and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and took a very small cohesion right in the decision process of the team.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic visited this decision and noticed that the Union will immediately search for a new tree.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my obligations as Chefrainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, patience and determination," said the 50-year Roy in a opinion.
I have been able to improve this team in order to provide more deepness to him, that it needs and bring it to a level of ability.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the Tree and Vice President of Hockey operations must be perfectly voted to the organization.
He must also have a cohesion right in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are not satisfied at present.
Sakic, who took Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions for the team.
"Patrick has informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and want him to be the best for the future.
Roy was exposed to the Avalanches 2013-14 as winners of Jack Adams Awards as the best tree of the Liga.
He led the unit to 112 points and the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was destroyed in the first part of the playoffs of Minnesota and lost the afternoon in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches deployed a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wildcard Spot in the Western Conference about five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy wined four Stanley Cups -- two parts with the Montreal Canadian and the Avalanche.
Northern Oil Workers take up again, set out strike
The workshops relating to the recompense for the North Sea Oil Workers will be excluded, while all fighting parties are set up to the table for a new interview, said negotiations leaders.
Streek against the Oil field service leader Wood Group was spently carried out on platforms in the North Sea running by Royal Du日 Shell.
"Wood Group and the Units and RMT facilities can confirm that we have agreed to restart the development process of the current conflict," it says in a common statement.
We will stop some full-day meetings in the next week, the beginning of the next year to restart the problems.
The workshops said that their last street, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible loan reductions from up to 30 Pro.
Wood Group has reduced the advice to his contractors in the North Sea in this year about 9% due to a negative market pressure.
The rates reduction of the company follow a 10-percent reduction for the employees of Onshore in 2014.
The undertaking said that the company had a regular shorter of the company to provide the needed space to come through the market rate.
Shell has solved thousands of people for its part and announced plans to provide its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, since it has analysed its business activities as a result of its mega combination with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy enterprises are under pressure due to the lower prices of raw oil, a economic situation strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scotch Parliament member Dave Anderson met the beginning of this week with workers to discuss one of the largest workshops that have been located since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
2016 are expected less than 1.4 billion dollars for new projects in the North Sea in comparison to a average of $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler missed rotation rate of stars in the stars of the Plejaden
The latest mission with the Kepler world space telescope has helped astronomes to collect the fullest catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the stars of the planets.
The new data helps the astronoms to understand why the stars are rotated to different rats in the starhouse, and in what context the rotation periods are with the planet decreasing.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the story of his sun system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Procesing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press communication.
The star bowl of the Plejaden is 445 light jars from the earth.
Stars in this starhouse, which occurred about 125 million years ago, now get the rising age.
They're turning fastest now.
These refining stars had a large number of stars.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a breaming effect on the stars.
When a star is old, his rotation rate begins to delay.
Kepler loses the rotation rate of every star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a famous starflow -- such as sunflow.
The newest catalogue of rotation rates shows that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dances, with greater stars of slow pirouettes to turn smaller.
"In the Ballet of the Plejades, we see that late rotors tend to be massive, but more faster rotors tend to be very light stars," replied Rebull.
Since the starhouse of the Plejaden is so close, it serves as a ideal cosmic lab to compare star qualitys such as rotation rates.
"The starhouse of the Plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the star rotation in both directions, younger and older," replied Rebull.
It is still much before us that we want to learn more about how the way, wan and why the stars will relent their rotation rates and thus add their "tanch shoes".
Rebull and their colleagues have reported in three magazines their latest analysis of the rotation rats of the Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A constraint baseball star declines
The trees lived faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US Baseball Star in the best days of Base to Base.
After his emotional recovery announcement, the 41-year-old Profi on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays will last be the trikot of his New York Ya月es.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-small All-Star Game participant of the League Baseball (MLB).
Dreimal Rodriguez was chosen to be the most valuable player of the Liga, 2009 he wined the World Series with the Yaées.
His signature under a Tehnjahr contract protected him from 2007 for 27 million dollars.
To the end of the contract, on 31 December 2017, it works as advisers and youth coach in full holding.
The player paid is Rodriguez long time with performance back.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005, he created some miles of stones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-olds do not need to be taken into the halls of the baseball.
Because like Rodriguez - Spitzname "A-Rod" was on the field, so his occurrence has been restricted outside the space.
In 2009, the Superstar was allowed to take the steroides prohibited between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked for 211 parties because of a development in the so-called bi©sis scandale until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is used as a major advertising for a year through an anti-Aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal fight, the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings.
"The Liga could even have done me a pleasure for 2014 because I have been playing 20 years without pause," said Rodriguez.
It doesn't even pass without sound.
As many baseball legends in their last games again received the big bowls, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include the abschaeds tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win each game," eated Ya月es-Coach Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez, who was married with the shower Cameron Diaz and who was discussed with Popstar Madonna and Kate Hudson's shower, was a sympathic announcement of the fans from Yarêe-errival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the attachers sang at the 4:9 downstairs against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first cases
Remember: Because of a positive trial, weighter Adrian Zielinski cannot start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympics games 2016 are overcome by the first official events.
An athletin had almost won a medaille.
Before the seventh July Conflict Day, the first official cases have become the Olympics games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese whistler Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria, and the Poland Poland Power Header Adrian targetinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the critical light athletic claims come to the time.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already demonstrated on the last Sunday, which is used as a masking means for doë substances.
The International Sport Court of CAS worked on Friday Wednesday the local time of its exemption from the Olympical Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had set the fourth place in the final over 100 m Schmetterling, only about 0.09 seconds, she lost the bronze media.
On Friday, Chen should have shared in the provisions over 50 m free style.
Chen requested in the International Olympical Committee (IOC) the opening of the B tests and a consultation.
The national association takes the matter "very serious and required by Chen full cooperation in the investigations", quoted Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sport Court of CAS and will accept the judgment."
The first time in the history is not the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of the sporters with positive cases.
Similarly, in the night of Rio, the message survived about the positive test in Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the opening.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," that is "increasing shock", she said to the Bulgarian TV sender BNT.
You're innocent, "the only clothes could be the supplementary means," explained the light atletin.
According to the report, the prohibited substance should be regarded by EPO.
Danekowa has been temporarily suspended, as BNT should also have been a positive B test.
President of Bulgaria Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticism in Athletin.
"I don't understand why the sporters don't take the right keys," he said, "We're Bulgarians under observation, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, all weight captains from the cross-doble national cannot participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case was also "Adrian Zielinski", which was tested by the London Olympiager in the class to 85 kg as his brother Tomasz three days ago positively on the anabolic Steroid Nandrolon.
Both strive to the receipt, however, both cannot be started in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light athletes, especially the case Danekowa is a further difficult step for the reputation of the whole sports art.
The world link IAAF had underlined the entire Russian community to a exception because of the systematic Do©s the start, as well as the Leuferation of Kenia produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the previous proceedings in China were also providing for strong deficiencies between the atletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese olympian Sun Yang harsch.
"The Son of the Ones is swimming."
"If I see the podium over 200 m free style, I want to deliver me," Lacourt said in French radio.
Sun also was in the middle of an exhibition with the Mack Horton.
"I don't have time or respect for Do-Trukers," said he.
Sun was in 2014 at the Chinese Masterships positively tested on the Stimulans Trimetazidin, but only a three-month lock had to stay.
Data clause: such perfide pressed hacker their solvency
The programming programmers of pressure-Malware take up currently targeted enterprises - and are there.
According to a current survey of Malware-abwear specialists Malware bytes under 540 companies in North America, United Kingdom and Germany, 40 Pro · the companies asked in the past twelve months were at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with Epresser software.
In Germany there were almost 20 Pro­companys already a goal of a ransomware pressure.
40 Per of the victims voluntaryly paid the solvents requested by the carriers to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The teasers specialize their empresser software sounds the observations of malware bytes, obviously, on attacks in business networks.
If they are there, the potential to pressure solvent is clearly deemed to be used by users.
"We're currently watching a terrible evolution of the shadow software," said Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Klečinski in conversation with the "Welt".
2008, most malware programmes were still issued to send publicity.
Then the teasers discovered pressure software for themselves.
First, the users were the goal, but the exchange to companies has been scared rapidly in the past months.
Ransomware → according to a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, it is intended to search for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
Then the software presents the requests of the empressors.
To get the End Encryption Code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptoweeh Bitcoin.
However, where users are on the game, the personal photo database is related to sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production stops.
Consequently, the damage falls when a ransomware is added.
22 Pro · the relevant German companies reported transmission losses by ransomware, 13 Pro^ had to completely interrupt the business activity, in one case people were living.
In Germany, many times hospitals were victims of attacks who could have been acutely threatened by the loss of hospitals.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you're just promoting the problem," Kleczynski said.
However, 80 to 90% of the firms who have sealed get their data again.
For Manager, it is difficult to refuse the request of the teasers, in view of silence in the operation.
The hackers again know that and try to build a → reputation.
In a current area, the security researchers of F-Secure have examined the user areas and contact with the pressors and come to the result: The dads are trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They declare their victims by chat, how they can carry through Bitcoin, adjust or decrypt freely accessible Support websites to other example files.
And by payments of few hundreds of euros, companies must share hard negotiations and pay five-sized sums to return their data unencryptedly.
In view of the potential high and relatively riskless winning from the ransomware exposure, the hackers will always be professional and share the work, the security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus supplier Sophos explains: "A individual person can write a ransomware within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.
The programmers then overcome their shadow software in a form of software buckets to the pressors.
The current malware kids occurred by buying the malware himself, advice and associated tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 100,000.
"In the delivery area contains an adjustment tool so that smaller configuration, appearance and burning can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The empressors then seek more hackers to spread the freshly covered software under the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you are logged into one of the fores in the background, buying the set of a criminal and ordering another to install the software on many computers as possible.
Payment is made by incompatible computer.
"The criminals are generally responsible for spreading," said Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is in the middle of many companies who improve their data.
More than 50% of the company-IT responsibles in the Malware bytes query trust that Ransomware can be removed through file-backups and scanner software.
Thus, the teasers are already pursuing new.
"If the encryption of data only is no longer adequate threat to deterioration, the damners are in place of publishing sensitive data such as customer lists or pricealcules," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Klečinski.
This is why the damage potential is still more than before, according to the type of data.
In addition, the teasers could be able to take completely new goals in the Internet of things on the wheat.
On the Hacker Conference Defcon demonstrated security researchers, how they could receive a termostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth such a ransom sacrifice.
If the tissues are blocking a whole fermentation road in a factory, ransomware can also be a subject in the industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and always ambiguous
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to packaging everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the rationality of a minivan.
It sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, is actually very flexible at all day.
Although only 1,60 m high HR-V is more small, the passengers have a lot of place both in the first range and in the Fund, it does not affect anywhere.
The materials of the internal are well delighted and worked, only the cockpit surface is falling out there.
More than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at stauraum.
There is not only a 453 l coffee space available in high-sized and 1026 l in the range of refunds, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magic than it sounds: the backbank's seats are throwing up as a kinosessel, and thus offers stauraum from the ground to the deck of 1,24 m high.
The coffee room can be well loaded, however, the lade height of 650 mm is something elsewhere than comparable in 2008.
The tested 1,6-l-diesel with 88 kW/120 PS reduces the HR-V thanks to the rotation of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation areas.
However, he must make his work a little slighter.
The daily consumption of 4,7 l/100 km is satisfied.
There is another motorization: a 1,5-l-benziner with 96 kW/130 PS.
A allrading operation is not offered.
The conduct is equipped, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
But the link must be something more direct.
The exhibition doesn't allow any desire to be open in the tested top "Executive".
The security systems belong to the City Notbrem Assistant (to Tempo 32), the collection warning system and the tracking assistant.
The collisions warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "overcoming objects".
Very trustworthy of the remote light assistant.
And the intellectual Temporary ruler reacts to the character recognition and disturbs the speed when needed.
But there is only for the top exhibition: 7-touch, Navi, App-Integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are located under the handlee and are therefore to get something inconsistent.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equiped top diesel are all right.
Whoever doesn't want to invest so much, gets the benziner from 20000 euros, the Diel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro-6 gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a multilateral and daily car.
Airline not holding: Root on Airlines
A airline doesn't hold for the road of a passenger on the airport.
Since a complaint is only able to be considered in the case of types of air traffic, the Supreme Court of Justice Düsseldorf argumented (No. 18 U.12.14).
The claimer had broken a kidnapped on the street.
However, the accident could have made everywhere - it is a general life risk, such as the court.
The flight company didn't have to kill the man's damage.
Sickness cases: When payment is paid by the agents
Krank vacants receive money only after their journey, if the cause of illness is to find free in the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than → Pro > the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was sick on the second day of its tourism authorization on a disorder and disruption.
She had almost all the vacation in the room.
Their illness led the authors back to a defected clothing layout that seemed to have been destroyed by the seawater.
The family was thinking that the journey was insufficient with it - and complained against the agents.
The complaints were not successful before the court.
Why the claim was actually defect.
However, the actors experienced only a short time before the complaints were dismissed.
He had to go out until the seawater was all right.
So he has not lost his information obligations, so the judgment.
In the water tests, no contamination was found.
The illness of several hotel guests - maybe by improving each other - belongs to the general life risk.
On 691 guests were only 38 sick.
The Maizière said that after the refugees exercised in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The State must be visited and determined to respond to terrorist traffics.
It is certainly: Our country will not answer the violence of the tactors with hatred and spacing.
This triumph is not going to get the terrorists.
If criminals had to quit the country sooner, it increased security and strengthened the approval of the people for the refugee policy.
The Maizière wants the implementation of the proposals until the assembly of 2017.
He also announced another personal strengthening of security forces, although "in the middle of a quarter-size order for several years".
The sympathic prosecution for terrorism must be again punished.
Video monitoring needs to improve, the weapons rights are renewled so that, in particular, the purchase of weapons on the Internet will be difficult.
The recently discussed weak obligation for doctors should be maintained according to the words of Maizière.
However, he wants to seek solutions in the Dialogue with the Medicines, how to reduce the risk of citizens, he said with appeal to mental emergency.
In order to resist the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers necessary to improve social sustainment.
Teachers must be better prepared for trafficking with traumatised people.
To follow criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet) the Maizière makes the use of covered investigators.
SPD Chapter Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhance security."
It is important that the Internal Minister has clearly voted against actionism.
"This was an orphan for the scarf mackers in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel said to the newspapers of the radio media group (Fireday).
The Maizière had previously rejected a call from the Union after a Burka prohibition and the decrease of the duplicate state.
A general prohibition of full-sufficiency seems to be constitutionally difficult.
You can't prohibit everything you refuse, and I'm refusing Burka's carrying out.
You can talk about rules such as in the road transport or for witnesses before the court.
The Green Chief Simone Peter foretold the Minister that he wanted to simulate new anti-Terror packages with reality and actionability.
Left-party officer Bernd Riexinger said, "Fleasting languages and a deterioration of the right of residence bring people in this country no more security."
Better driving flush on the car renter
It stands regularly on the road of the environment - here a picture from November.
However, this should be changed: the request to be extended.
This is a message for all car drivers who are at the environmental road every evening when they travel through the car travel (A 43).
The landscape road building extends on the next Thursday and midweek (16./17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Weseler Street.
Then car cars can directly fit from the Hammer Street on the right.
The great advantage: The construction is divided early, and the total decline is improved in the multi-poor section of the Federal Strategy 51.
The idea with the extended performance had the CDU group in the district representation of Münster-West.
The car rental on the supplier nerves the vehicles, especially between 17 and 19 hours.
Working days, the rest of the rest is enough to breath over the Albersless Road and sometimes out of the way.
The reason is that the nadel is on the B 51 short before the Weseler street.
From here, the verification is only simply lifted over the carrying bridges.
The second track had to be rebuild a few years ago.
The reason: Statistics have shown that the breasts have not yet been the needed tragedy holding, especially in order to drop the severe carriage.
As long as this engine pass and the working-day stage will be held with it, the competent country industry cannot say.
However, it is to be calculated in years: For the brake has an official use duration until 2034.
For the prolongation of the rights of the law, the landscape has consciously demanded the deteriorated time in the schools because it was to be counted with obstacles.
The vere shall be carried out on Thursday and middle-week at the building site.
Intercultural travel: Culture offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the "The Invisible House".
The United Nima's and the young theater are now planning a music project.
The United Nima's allows youths with migration and refuge background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Woodschool of Children's Children House has visited a presentation of the price-decreased item "The Invisible House" of the young teater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by the United Nima 19 students visited the inscenation in the small house between 11 and 15 years.
Since the beginning of the year, the Union, who has set up the cultural integration of youths with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the framework of this project.
Most youths in the class were coming to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, including from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Münster.
Thanks to the Choreographies, the Chinese images and video animations, however, they were able to follow the course of action, so the press communication of the young Theater Münster.
The United Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the young theater will cooperate in the next game in the framework of a music theater project.
From October to December, youths will have the opportunity to visit professionally engaging courses in the areas of anang, dance, show and music without flight and migration background between 14 and 20 years.
Officials for children and families in the area of theater games and theatrale language mediation are in the planning.
The "Intercultural Travel" project continues.
In view of the acquired flight numbers, the association with many classes that want to share.
Rain place stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the stars-snupped guckers in Southwest Germany the night on Friday - but there is still a hope.
The night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the heavens' spectacle, the president of the Starwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night for Saturday.
Weather must be good, then we will certainly see many stars in heaven.
The star shops are persians that belong to the fastest star shops with 216000 km/h.
They have their names because they seem to come from the star picture of Perseus, which is on the north-east.
Refreshing night: Tips against sleeping
At night, you're going to go forever, you're wakening for hours ago, tomorrow you're not going to think about sleep.
That's all other than rebuilding.
You always have such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, a quarter of the Adult Slaves is about and more than Â Pro© receives their sleep often or persistently than they do not.
How do sleep problems or sleeping problems occur?
There are several forms of sleeping, and they can cause many causes, Hans-Günter Weeß, representative member of the German Society for sleeping and sleeping medicine.
What you understand in the landscape, but the insomnia is, so, a single and transslave stuff.
As soon as soon as the dream of sleep, many people are inconscient or inadequate, Jens carservant, representative member of the German household association with practice in the netherlands.
What's behind sleeping?
The causes of sleeping are complex.
Inside, organic, mental or behaviour can be able to put medicines.
Not rare is the sleep stuff expressed by another disease.
"Very early waking is especially often in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different persons pray each other.
For example, whoever has a band-sharing accident, can be bad, waiting all two to three hours and may begin to bear over everyday problems and organs, gives a example.
This leads to stress, and sleep is no longer possible.
From whom should you sleep with sleeping to Ar?
Whoever doesn't sleep well and is affected on the day for a period of a month in at least three nights per week, should go to Ar, rare wheat.
The impact can seem very different: you are dismissed, deceived, unslaved, have difficulties with attention and concurrence, is easily roadable, have voting disorders or physical disorders such as magic or head pain.
To linch the slaughter, it is important to find out their causes.
As treatment options, including behavior changes, cognitive behavior therapy or also medicines - classic sleep bulls only in the exception and at least for two weeks.
In Germany there is no sleep medication, Prof. Ingo Fietze, leader of the interdisclineary sleep medical centre of the Charity of University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, when sleeping problems, you should turn to the household, rare wheat.
It can show that the problems have a physical cause.
Who's supposed to sleep in the lab, and what's going on there?
For the study in the slaughter lab, for example, medicals advise the cause of a slaughter with atemaussites, sickness of day, sleeping, or if you do not find the cause of a slaughter.
Preparation for the investigation should not be done.
You should take the day normally.
"But don't be sleeping afternoon," says Fitze.
After the bathroom, you're going to bed at your normal time.
Besides the electrons in the body, you have a nose brilliant, a brush and a feeler at your finger.
A camera also opens the sleepers on the cover.
How can the concerns get the problems in the face?
There are a lot of shoes that can be used for a better sleep.
Weezh counts on: regular sleep and upstairs, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, don't television to sleep, don't look at alcohol and night - then you're starting to count immediately, and that's totally not beneficial.
What the dungelcamp has to have with bleeding medals in the wheat
The former German Schwimmer Markus Deibler expressed himself by Facebook to discourage the DSV team in Olympic.
In December 2014, he first took gold in the short-way world masterships in Doha and set up his first good-tree word at the same time.
Now the former DSV-Atlet Markus Deibler has been set by Facebook before his former team colleagues in the criticism.
"In a country where a 200,000-year-old olympionist receives a premium and a 150,000-year king should not be wondered about the missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old night on Friday on his Facebook page.
The support system in the swimming sport is bad, the control controls are very good.
This is why we cannot competite with countries who are very much promoting and do not look so exactly or even practice it.
"I don't say that the controls are to be set here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler should have been reported for nine months ago the first start of the National Anti-Do Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly what you should do with countries.
"Who is not able to control a certain time before WM/OS by independent controllers of WADA/F, not to participate," requests the electoral hamburger who is in the middle of the iron.
Airports: Bands of package depths fixed
Professional dieb at Düsseldorf Airport
Citizens of Düsseldorfer Police on Thursday took the arrest of two women and two men from age of 50 to 61.
The realistics had a number of bottles and packaging depths as bands.
By 21.30 a.m. civil officers in the area of the Airport Düsseldorf recognized a band that was the police from the past debt-stock delegates.
The two women and two men have committed several delegates since mid July this year and have been Community, workful and specially professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissioner 34 can prove four facts to the dead who were in the case of crimes to Germany.
They totally used more than 15,000 euros.
Alt building, a few linen trees, between a dictionary headstone: The Rigaer street in Berlin-Fichtrichs doesn't affect the first cup, but the police counts it to the "Govern places" of the city.
If you go to the street from East to West, you come to game places, a freshly babie garden and a bioload.
At the fashion of a green house, somebody shot "fearly!"
On the contrary of a lidl that will also be thrown quickly, it is already built: Until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rooms.
However, articles about this "trendigen city part", such as the relevant immobilious firm Friedrichs, have been designed in the last weeks with burning cars.
The house with number 94 is reasonable: Once it was occupied, in the middle of the middle of the contracts, but in the territory are still occupied spaces and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlinian internal Senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard operation of the police against the project, the region as "No-Go-zone" for the police and the 94 as the beginning of autonomous violence.
After on June 22, the spaces in the earthquake, the border boxes, with 300 police officers, patroliated the police three weeks along of official statements with 30 to 40 employees and three guardian cars in front of the place, locked parts of the street and kept the house with 94.
Currently renewed building workers in the task of unrecognized home owners are the rooms.
On 13 July, a Berliner administrative court dismissed that the space was illegal, and one day later → Police and building workers under the jubel of sympathisants and residents.
On this Sunday, the road works peacefully: Parents go to space with children, people sit on the citizen station before the households in the sun, others talk for forms later.
In directly near the home projects, a basic school and children's garden are.
Left violence is not the principal cause of many inhabitants: Kerstin New builder who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who grows up three children here, is primarily generated by the police presidency.
With the residents of the home projects, they share the concern of growing midsts and gentri creation.
It doesn't sound like a choice that wants more policies protection from vandalating links.
The grave that the Berliner internal Senator and the police between the householders and their neighbors are not so obvious.
Friedrich in East Berlin was a traditional workersquarters, which has a low average income and high poverty risk today in comparison to town.
Along with the households and its born living projects already belong to the choice: 1990, many households were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the whole street near the Rigaer.
Since the major police order was released in a regular road battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still resided today by those who have been occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the city part of the last years has become a magnetic for tourists and electors from all the world: with them people are now shared from DDR times and ancient home visitors.
This is also noteworthy in the midsts that have been reached by almost 60 Pro.
Rebuilding in the rigaes will be attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognised on injected vessels or freshly stucked fashions that have been processed with color bubbles.
No other road was so often called this year with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason for not all neighbors to consider this as a problem may be that they are not extremely affected by criminality: crimes such as corporate damage are almost against cops.
The majority of the crimes makes acknowledgements that trendly prefer the rebuilding and freshly renewed houses.
For Kerstin New builder, who lives in a village house near the circumstances of 94, can not be uncertain.
As regards violence, it is fair: The people in the 94 are their neighbors, which would certainly not have been.
Moreover, the famous burning cars have no longer given it directly in the rigaer.
For the studied architect, their street is not a criminal focal point, in contrast: "This is helping one another, le ́teen on the street and getting more of each other than wherever."
The new builder is conscious of the Rigaer Street and remains in the Rigaer Street.
That is why it was so important for her to return their road: from the police, the ­ and the media that suddenly approved the highness of the city part in July.
However, in the eyes of residents like new builders, the road continues to be removed by them: by invisible rebuilding in ancient bowls that disturb the old inhabitants.
"These are lastly ownership apartments that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well visited here," she says.
"I can't absolutely say good."
But what if someone never listens to?
There is frustration on all sides, including police and residents.
For tours that suffer over color bombs, Kerstin New builder has little understanding: The house projects and the left scenes belonged to the choice.
He who goes up should be conscious of it - just as someone who goes into a kidneysquarters can hurt him.
All of those who have been presented with fornames have requested not to be called by their right name
Urbach: Annika Bogchle is a new refuge officer
Annika Bogchle is the interview partner in matters Integration and Organisator.
It is a social worker at the place.
Since July, Annika Bogchle is the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pêdagogin supports the Achim Grockenberger administration team.
It seems to be a meeting partner for all participants: refugees, workers of refugee, administration, authorities, and others.
Regine customer from the work circuit indicates that the honourable people are more than thankful that Godchle is now there, the egging wolf milk, which has a problem, especially.
In this way, some - less stressing than much more to the number of job areas in the desired areas - were intended by the administration to express the position.
It has become a administrative power with a talent for languages and people associated with a long-term experience in the social work, including an egging wild milk.
However, administrative work is not its central area, I mean Annika Bogchle.
In particular, it's about organization, work with people from the place, as well as behind the cools and network activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has expired a 50-pro-cell for three years.
"It was the maximum time," says Regine customer that Annika Bogchle supports the main and honourable actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and comprehensive problems.
Soon new containers are in the wash road
A serious problem has been found from some time to find apartments for the refugees who have been recognised.
The communities are responsible for accession.
You must take the refugees in your own or admired residence rooms.
The costs for building, middle-up or renewal of these meetings must be the communities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Agricultural Board to Community and Job Centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every host wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been made very difficult since sometimes.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, where you are assigned to residences such as Diochle.
Thus, there must be an end of apartment, as it is called as beautiful.
So new containers will soon be placed in the wash road.
But only with apartments it's not done.
Perspective is the stack, Regine customer and Annika Diochle agree.
Besides a fixed stage, there are practical plans, training facilities, school facilities, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports the Regine customer.
Work in the building or help householders, perform useful work - and that motivates and very correctly, as Annika Bogchle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community income leads to a positive external effect.
It's "no employment treatment".
However, activity does not only mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Diochle and customer.
People have to develop a sense of responsibility.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with home and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So the administration and honour officials are also inclined here.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of the procedure is a problem.
You must declare to the refugees that it takes the time and can overwrite the time significantly, for example with language courses.
Whoever ever develops the feeling, he can help no one in Urbach, do not work and be unusual, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are problems, as the customer says honestly, "the people who are not going to do anything." Thus, the work of Diochle and customer is always to motivate others.
All this is a "mamamat" task.
A difficult question: Do they both have the latest events before radicalization, even in a small community such as Urbach?
"No," says Regine client clearly, "what some may be called naiv." A risk can be and does not want to exclude it.
Sensibly, the helpers are already.
These events are also the subject of the refugees.
They would've been the most important that the attenters would bring them completely into a disappointment.
"You want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine client.
They would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, main and honorable officers have to look at activities in the area and in the region.
They have always found that a new station of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Is Germany needing a top limit?
To answer this question clearly, it seems to be.
In fact, it is unfair to put the helpers in place.
"In Urbach we haven't yet arrived where we met," Annika Bogchle says.
No new refugees, that would disappoint the situation.
Regine customer also points out that the urbators have already been charged with reasonable integration of the people of this day.
It's now about 100 people, most young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political system is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
