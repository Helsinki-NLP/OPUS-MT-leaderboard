Valiian additional deputates are inquired of those who look like marine.
The deputates do not say why their deputy status should be changed to the status of the "member of the Wels Parliament".
The deputy has failed to rename the local east to the "Walls Parlement".
The deputy of all political views believe that it's a matter.
One deputat-leaver said his colleagues are concerned about that it's ridiculed with the words "made" and "new".
For readers outside Wales: Valiian twp means "double", and pwp means "new".
The deputy said her group was totally uncomfortable and offered alternatives.
Valley conservators said that their group was ready to discuss the change of the name of the east, but they noticed that it was a short speech transition from the member of the Valley Parliament to the "marines".
In this context, the w-wallian letter is the same as the Ireland English speaking letters u.
The Commission of the Assembly, who now develops the Law on the changes to the name, made a statement: "A definitive resolution, according to any description of what the east deputy calls, will be, in question of the members."
The Wales Government Act since 2017 allows the Valley East to rename its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the national consultation on proposals, in which a wide support was shown to be called the east of the House of Wells.
As regards the title of the additional deputy, the Commission gave the favour to the members of the House of Wells or the CAP, but the GUP warrant had the greatest support during the consultations.
Additional deputates, obviously, offer alternative options, but the way to reach consensus can be a major pain for the elderly, Ellin Johns, which, as it seems, presents a legislative project on changes by the weight of a few of you.
References will also include other changes in the assembly, such as the rules on the disclining of additional deputy and changes in the struct of the committee system.
Additional deputy takes a final vote about how to call them when they perform their legal work.
People vote on a reference to the change of country's name
On Wednesday, the electors speak for the change of their country's name to the Republic of Northern Education or against it.
The national vote was organized with a aim to resolve a multiannual question with the neighboring Greece, which has its own area named Eden.
In Athena, the name of their northern neighbor is a prophecy on their territory, which prevented the integration and friendship of the Ecc and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The President of George Ivan's video, a referendum manager for the rename, stated that he would not participate in voting.
But the referenndums, in the number of Mr. Zoran Zaeves, say that the name change is just a cost to be paid for the entry into the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The named temple of the Holy Martin speaks, the boots in Harlem fight for the existence
"Before the elderly people with whom I spoke, there was bar and church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Nothing is here today, neither the other."
He said the disappearance of bars was with a rough.
"The people have different relationships and openings today," he said.
"Bars are no longer intimate local hotels where people are going permanently."
As regards the church, he is unrepentant that money from the sale of assets doesn't stop in such a long period as the leaders expect, and early or later they're back there, from the beginning.
The Churchs, -- he added, -- can be replaced by old women with the condomines, full of people who will not help the temples to stay in the area.
"The majority of those who buy the condoms in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore it's the day when these churches are closed together, because it's probably important that the pain of people who are going to these condoms will be the inhabitants of these churches."
Both churches were built as a group of white before Harlem became a black area — the Church of the Stalical Grammade in 1870, the Church of Saint Martin in decades.
The first white white white range went in the 1930s.
The black middle that prayed nearly had the right of the property for the building.
The Church of Saint Martin was the west of a charmful board under the governance of John Howard Johnson, which signed a battle of a band on the main band in Harlem 125 Street, where they were refused to reject or move the crowds.
In 1939, the fire left the building strongly harmful, but the wallets under the control of the ice Johnson planned a river: they took a corilion operation.
David Johnson, the son of Johnson's yes, and his guest in the Church of Saint Martin, called the king's name "the calls of the poor people".
An expert who played on the rubber in the cover called this otherwise "Cultural Scarb" and "unreplaceable historical tool".
Expert Tiffany Ng from the Michigan University also noted that it was the first in the world of the Queen, on which he played a charnascore playing Dianisia A. Lind, who passed 18 years ago to a larger corilion in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriveser said in the Church of the Saint Martin didn't replace it.
What happened in the Church of Saint Martin for a few months was a composite story between architects and subsequents, some of whom were captured by the church leaders, others are the epargy.
The east of returners, the leading body of the arrival, which consists of the coppers, wrote to the earlier, with a warning that the earlier is trying to translate the costs to the east, although the east did not participate in the architects and submissions that the earlier had sent.
The income was deceived to have no transparence on the side of the era.
Akula's 13-year-old boy's paranois during the arrival for the breaking of lobsters in California.
On Saturday, the earlier attacked and ran the 13-year-old boy who fell on the lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the season lobsters.

At first, he thought that it was just a surprise from the lobsters, but then he said, "What's happened, "I've been kissed!
I've been thrilled!"
"All his key was broken," he said, "additioning what he noticed when he came to the boy.
I called everyone to get out of the water, "in the water near the oak." He added.
The boy was transported by the air to the childhood of Raydy's hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical state.
The diversity of the axle, which has been attacked, is not.
Captain Larry Jills said at the MS Bridge that the bullet was noted in this place a few of you were before, but it was decided that it was an uncertain diversity.
Jales added that suffering has received a trauma of the part of the knife.
The men closed the approaches from Ponto-Bitch in Casablade to theirs in Essinitas for 48 hours to carry out research and security.
Jalez noted that this area lives more than 135 kinds of acils, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's planning to move on the britain market of beauty
Sainsbury's going to work with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, opening a department with beauty travels in university where specialists will work.
In the context of a significant movement on the British market of beauty in 2,8 billion pounds of sterling, which continues to grow, while the total sales of modern clothing and ha's travels are decreased, the greater women of beautifulness will be represented in 11 salons throughout the country and also in other new salons in the future year that the demo is sleeping.
The investment in the field of beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for the way of filling the place on the police, which were previously taken by televisors, microwave bodies and stores for the house.
Sainsbury's claimed to double the wide range of beauty, offering up to 3000 products, including the broadbands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw first.
There is an azartimment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also will be given more place in business divisions adequately to those who can be found in towns such as Boots.
Great crops also restart their boutique cosmetic line, so most of the products will be added to the weeks, and this trend becomes more required among young buyers.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop will test the concession in the Sainsbury's courts, the first of which was opened at the last week in Croydan south London, and the second is opened in Sally Owk (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Buying in the Internet and going to buying small numbers of products that in local rooms around the house leads to that surmarket must make more effort to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Kupe, executing Director Sainsbury's, said that the trailers will be more favorable at the university, because the supermarket network is trying to compete with Aldi's deputyers, Lidl with a greater number of servants and non-carriers.
Sainsbury's placed the bands to the Argos in hundreds of feeds, and also placed a few points of Habitats since two years ago, both networks, which, according to his words, made the growth of the sales of food and made it more income.
The first trial of the surmarkets of the river to make their departments of beauty and apte hasn't been successfully completed.
Sainsbury's protested with Boots at the beginning of 2000, but the trial to share income from the aptical ships ended after a series of surmarkets.
The new technology appeared after three years ago, Sainsbury's sold its apte business together with the 281 center of Celesio to the aptical network owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds of sterling.
It was declared that Lloyds played his role in this plan, extending the azartiment of the fresh bridges for the skin's care, in that number of La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four places.
"We have changed the outer look of our beautiful salons to improve the conditions for our clients.
We also invested in the training of our workers that could offer their recommendations.
Our brands are developed in the light of any needs, and our privacy and a pleasant location makes us a better house of beautifulness, which will resist the old way of shopping."

The rest of Rosa's arms will bring strong springs to the southern west of the United States.
According to the prognoses, Rosa's uragan is better because it moves over more cold waters from the north of Mexico.
However, in the nearest days of Rosa, the North of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
The speed of Rose, a range of 1 category, was 85 miles per hour in 5 hours in the East Time on Sunday, and it was fixed in 385 miles southwest from Pont-Euchenia in Mexico.
Rose, as expected, moves to north in Sunday.
In the middle of the Pacific, the area of the pressure that moves eastward to the west area of the United States begins to shape over the Pacific. When on Monday the Rose is close to the south-east of California in the form of a tropical storm, it starts to swim the deep tropical wind to the north, north-western USA.
On Monday, Rosa took up in some parts of Mexico to 10 pounds of falls.
Then the tropical wind, which interacts with the coming area of pressure, in the nearest days calls strong lows on the southwest.
For the people from 1 to 4 pounds of falls, it calls dangerous ramps, landscapes, and winds in the wilderness.
The deep tropical advantage will lead to that the number of accidents in places will reach 2-3 pounds per hour, especially in some areas of South Nevada and Arizona.
In some regions of the northwest, especially in the largest part of the Arizona, it's expected from 2 to 4 pounds of falls.

It would be very unnecessary to go out into the wilderness forward because of the possibility of the threat of tropical accidents.
The strong rain can lead to that the canyons are converted into a furious river, and the rain will be counted with a wind and a lung.
The incoming area of pressure brings a strong rain in the part of South California.

The broadcast tropical rain begins to be close to the Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain goes all over to the end of Monday and August.
The strong rain will be spread in the area of four angles in August and continue to the middle.

But Flake said that he would do this, just because the FBI would check the accusations against the candidate for a week, to which democracy would be determined from a number of minorities.

Coincidence of the police with Catalogue Separatists Previous Years of voting for independence
On Saturday, in Barcelona, six people were arrested after the dealers of independence were met with the police for the debt of the public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration in the nomination of the first year of the political vote on the division of Catalonia.
A group of separators in masks that were held by the police in the field of the public order, kicked their eggs and blowned a parascale color by creating dark clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the same day the battle was able when the police used their depths to keep demons.
During a few hours, a group of fighting groups for independence, who scanned "Don't forget, don't give", met with the present professional actions who cried "Life Spain".
According to the messages of local press, fourteen persons have passed the fear of the unusual traumatisms received in the process of protest.
The pressure in the region that tries to independence remains high a year after the referency of 1 October, which Madrid admitted the illegal, but which symbolized catalogues-separatists.
The electors in the major majority have removed the importance of independence, although the whistle of the electors was a tragic degree that was explained by a bullet of voting.
According to the Catholic authorities' data, 1,000 people have been wounded after the police tried to stop voting on election parts throughout the region as a result of disappeared democrats' actions.
The groups who expressed independence were running night on Friday to promote the demonstration in support of the national police of Spain.
The demonstration has occurred, but the protesters have been forced to go on another way.
The 68-year Narciss Termes, the electricist who is present on the separate protest together with his wife, said that he is not longer expected to receive the inadequacy of Catalonia's independence.
"We've survived one of the best moments.
I saw my fathers weeping from joy when they were voting, but now we're lost," he said.
Without confidence in the same important, but insignificant victory on regional elections in December last year, the Catalogue party who expressed independence, from all forces tried to keep the impulse in this year with many of their most known leaders and were deceived or in a voluntary exemption, or in disappointment, waiting for the court for the organization of the referencedom and an incompatible exhibition of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanism John Puch, who writes a protest in the support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was related by politicians on both sides.
"Stop all the pressures," he said.
On the Sabbath, Ariel Junkeras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who were in the AIDS from the end of the year last, reported that he would participate in the elections of the European Parliament in the year.
"Select as a candidate to European elections is the best way to deal with the democratic values and represions we saw by the Government of Spain," he said.
Londres: Men are drawn after they broadcast the house on the car
Three men in the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car was once entered home in London.

As a result of Manga Lewiingstan, he's gained over Rangers with 1:0
The first hole of Doli Mangi for the use of Lewiningstone has provided them a victory
Successfully, Lewiningstone's name was Rangers, and it's to be assigned to Stephen Gerard after his a few suggestions in 18 games on the Ibrox club manager's station.
The Dolly Mangi was great because Gerry Holt got up to one level with the "Hibernians" in the second division.
Jerard's command in this season doesn't win out to p'er-lize and on Sunday he's met with leaders, the Harts command, which remains at eight points.
Before this "Rangers" in Lisa Eve, Rapid will take on Thursday.
Livingstone, sometimes, worked with his unexpected series in the area to six games, and the main trainer Holt still feels a parasite after Keny Miller was replaced in a month.
Livingstone passss the chances from the deep visitors
The command of Holt was to warn long before they killed, but the right direction you put in Rangers was a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson was broken, but lost his chance to kill in the gate, after which Allan Littles was able only to direct his strong width to meet Craig Hallet's hit.
The lords were glad to allow Rangers to play before them, knowing that they could take care of the guest at some time.
And that's exactly what the main goal was done.
On the side of Rangers, a traveller was allowed, and Lewingstan was dealing with debt, Declan Galacher and Robinson were united to transform Manga, who made the sand and killed from the field center.
By this time, the Rangeers's dominants, but it appeared that the protection of the command was inappropriate, and Liam Caley's arm was practically unactivated.
That's the same way in the second half, although Alfred Marlos really saved Caley.
The sword from Scot Pitman was broken by Rangers' breacher by Alan's Gregger, and Litgo went away from the second Lewingerstone's website.
The knifes continued to be in the Lewiingstone gate and were rejected, while two tools needed, after you had been set in the Hallet in replacement of Glene Medlton, and the need for playing with the hand, were rejected.
“Fenoman” from Lewiingstan is an analysis
BBC Scotland Allisday Lamont on Arene Tony Macroni
Fenomenal productivity and results for Livingstone.
For men, they were wonderful to continue waiting for this incoming traectory.
Their game style and composition practically haven't changed from the moment of their return to the highest axelon, but it's worth giving the appropriate Hall for how he stimulated the command from the moment of his destruction.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hallet was a gross, building a good organ protection, while Manga held Connor Goldson and Joe Warala over all over the field.
Rangers has not been inspired.
Which good they were not at Gerard, they did not conform to this standard.
They did not have the sword once they killed in the gate, which was something like an anxious call for Rangers, which was in the middle of the list.

With the protesting against Erdhagan, many of whom were curses, also expressed their opinion, condemning as the political of Erdgan, as well as the government of Germany to welcome him in the country.
Protests reflect the diversity of the guests, which some German Turks have declared by hero, and others have judged as an autocracy.

AMLO in Mexico promises not to use an army against peaceful lives

US must double financing for machine intellectuals
"When China becomes more active in the area of machine intellectual, the United States must double the amount they cost for research in this hall," says the investor and specialist of the CIA intellectual, who worked in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments appeared after the various parts of the United States government made a statement of MI, even if there is no official MI in the United States.
Meanwhile, in the past year, China represented its plan: until 2030 he tries to be the first in the billion of innovations of the MI.
"It would be a good beginning of the budget for research in the area of the MI, since all other countries are far away from the United States, and we're waiting for a break in the area of MI," said Lee.
"Financial funding can double the probability of the major achievement of the MI in the United States," said Li on the CNBC in the interview this week.
Li, whose book The Excellent Intelligence: China, the Sylicon Valley and the New World Council was published in this month by Houtton Mitlin Harcurt, is the main executive director of the Sinovation Ventures company, who invested in one of the most famous MMI companies in China, Face ++.

"The U.S. researchers often have a lot of work to get state grants," said Lee.
"This isn't China who takes academic leaders; it's a corporation," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technological companys in the past years have been able to take a spectacle from universities to work over the MI.
Li said that the change of immigration policy could also help the United States to enhance their efforts in a machine intellect (MI).
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to the candidate in the MI hall," he said.
In April 2017, China's Governing Council issued a plan for the development of a machine intellectual generation.
"The National Natural School Fund provides funding for people in scientist institutions, adequately as the National Scientific Fund and other national organizations distribute money for U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China below," said Lee.
Before this year, the U.S. Ministry of Protection created the United Intelligence Centre in which partners should participate in industrial and scientific cycles, and the White House has informed the creation of the Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And in this month, the Agency on the previous research in the hall of protection reported investments in 2 billion dollars called AI Next.
As regards the National Scientific Organization (NSF), it is currently investing in the IMI study more than 100 million dollars per year.
Among them, the United States customs, who tried to create the Commission's national security on the machine intellectual, did not monitor actions for several months.

Before the building of a parliament in Scope, Ulodimmer Cowards, 54 years of age, he split a small center and placed stones in front of the palaces set by those who would fight a referendom.
"We're for NATA and the EU, but we want to join the lifted heads, not through the service doors," said Cawadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have honour.
If they don't want to take us as a Federation, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European integration."
Property'er minister Zaew said that the NATO's friendship takes the necessary investment in the Education, where the deficiency level is more than 20 percent.
"I think the major number will be "for" because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and the NATA," said Zaav after voting.

And they are full of demands to return to themselves the authority, using any necessary tools, you see, area, merzote.
They're all worth who they're deceiving who they have to kill to get power and control, it's what they want, that's the authority and control that we're not going to give them."
According to his words, the democrats are intended to "contrast and interrupt".
"And you see this in four days," he said, "what is the democratics, "what's wrong, lonely, inverse and incredible."
He saved the Senate Court for the previous recognition of the Senator's Democratic Group of Dyana Finstein, which received a sound review from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you have allowed the running of the document?
Eh, what.
No, I'm not waiting -- it was a very tremendous language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer a basic church.
It's an insatisfactory to those who express their opinion
When the active Momentum in my local party voted for me to hurt, it was almost a surprise.
Finally, I'm an appointment in a series of members of the parliament from the Library party who say they don't welcome us -- everything to express their opinion.
My colleague on Parliament Joan Ryan received an analogic turn, because she was determining to resist antisemitism.
In my case, the centurion discovered me because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of the responsible economic policy, of national security, of Eve, of the ironie of goods, which Jeremy didn't remember with the previous leaders.
In a meeting message, which was conducted on Friday of the East Library party of Notingham, we say, "We want these meetings to be consistent and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of the parliament from the Liberian party just such meetings were on Friday
Unfortunately, today in most of the meetings no such and the promise "the more good, more mild" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if really ever.
It becomes more evident that in the library party, different views are not allowed, and every opinion is estimated on the side of the view, it is acceptable for the partial management or not.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, as many college with which I had already considered that I shared the same political views, I started waiting for me to take a step back, and they took the positions that I wouldn't agree with — in the issues of national security or on the EU market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and this doesn't mean what I say -- in social networks there's a tirate of an image that's going to cancel the choices, condemning the center policy, saying that I'm not anymore in the Library Party.
And it's not just my experience.
From now on, I know that I enjoyed more than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me, as a rule, are political.
I'm in the west of the professionalism and the dealing of those colleagues that match the flow of sexual or racial events, but never reject.
One of the most disappointed people of this period of politics is normalization of crimes.
In the last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Leabarist Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're not any more organs of a different view, and with each movement of uncertainty or change of the rules of the party's choice, it's more important.
During approximately two years, I had given a lot of advice, which forbid me not to fall by spirit, not to be such a sound, and then all will be okay with me.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined Leabarists 32 years ago as a school student who was reported by the Tetcher Government, because of which my students were in school, I tried to stand the best government services for those who need more than all of them, let it be a local resident or a Governing Minister.
I never hided my political views, in that number of elections.
No one in Eastern Notting could hurt in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current governance.
For those who were fighting for this move on Friday, I would like to say that if the country of the ships is to Brexit, who have a damage to the householder, our business and our state service, I don't want to lose time and strength to my loyalty to the leader of the library party.
But actually, the only sentence I have is not not nottingham Momentum, it's my choices, whether it'll be members of the library, or not: I'm surprised by what I serve you, and I promise that no threat of the choices will be, and the political method will not prevent me to act in the interests of all of you.

Ire-Mel’s 38 - 17: Incapable Ire on top
Two later trials may have said a few of the final results, but, without doubt, Ere deserved a triumph in this wonderful interesting mother pre'er-ligue Tennet.
Now they set a tournament table, the only side of the ten.
Finally, it was their highest protection, as well as their best chances that made their masters, the Trener Peter Dead Merch had the full right to be satisfied.
"We've still tried our games until now, and we're still incapable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy from Mel'z said, "Get the Earu right, he's wounded more than we.
The 14-minute trial of Grant Anderson, converted by Freiser Clima, put Ira in a previous plan, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, received for Warriors, allowed Mel’s to join numbers, and Jason Baggot got for an unrealized trial.
The climate growth of the Ear's leadership with the helped tool, before, right in the wheel, he killed, and then made a solar trial by making 17-5 euros in the wheel.
But Melze well started the second half, and the trial of Patrick Anderson, converted by Bogo, was a distance to five points.
Then there was a long delay because of the serious trauma of Ruarid Note, which was growing up, and after the repeated start, Ire moved after the trial of Staford Dauel, the realistic climate.
Ear, performing the commitments of Captain Blair Ferson, got a yellow card, and again Mellose made another man pay with an unrealized trial of Bruce Colvin at the end of the February pressure.
However, the lords returned, and when Stroan Hatkinson got a yellow card for that he shot the Climate without the sword of the sword line, the Ferson landed behind the Ear.
The climate realized his trial that he did again after the repeated start, after that Kyle Row received David Armstrong's shot in the staff and sent Gregor Henry's flanger to the fifth trial of the hostage of the field.
The Star Still Game, good, ready for a new career in a restaurant business
However, the star of the Ford Kieran game is going to enter the hotel business industry after it was found that it was designed by the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a father of the BBC-sheet, which he wrote, and is screwed together with the old comedic partner of Greg Hamphil.
Duet reported that the nineth series is an ap-search in the series of hair, and it seems that Kernn plans to act after Craigland.
According to the official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.

"Our sea," Bali, who doesn't go out to the sea, hopes that the court will open again the way to the Pacific Ocean.
The mariners are watching a military-sea stab in La Pace.
Citizens' buildings under a blue tray.
In the military sea bases from Titicac to Amazona, the "Mora's right."
Refreshing is our commitment.
In the whole Balivia, which doesn't get out to the sea, the memory of the guard line of Chile in the blood conflict because of the resources of the 19th century, still alive -- like the trying to fly again through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached the maximum top of approximately decade, as long as Bolivia expects the decision of the International Court on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Ballivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and it is waiting for the results," said the Baltic Diplom of Robert Calsadullia.
Many Balibians will be watching the resources of the MS on large screens throughout the country, hopeing that the tribe in Hawaii after decades of pressed motions supports Bolivia's statement that Chili is obligated to conduct a conviction about the delivery of Balivia's sovereign outcome to the sea.
Eve Marales is a charismical president of Balivia, who is confronted with the contrary fight for re-electing in the year.
"We're very close to return to the Pacific," he killed at the end of April.
But some analytics believe that the court will almost take a decision for the use of Bolivia, and it's little to change, even if he'll do it.
The UN's organization, based in the Netherlands, has no right to make a decision on the Territory of Chile and said that it would not determine the outcome of ambiguous talks.
The fact that the International Court's statute comes only after six months after the final arguments were considered, to testify that the matter was "not complicated", said the Children's expert in the hall of international rights in the past Zarath.
And far away without the matters of Balivia, appealing four years may have left it back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Baltic Administration," said Sarat.
According to her words, the military ritories of Marales lost the rest of the Chinese welfare.
Bolivia and Chili will continue to talk, but then the debate will be very complicated.
Since 1962, the countries have not been dismissed by senders.
The former president Edward Radriges Velte, the representative of Bolivia in Gaza, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually fast.
On Monday, Balivia has brought “the exceptional opportunity to open a new time of relationship with Chile” and the possibility of ‘the end of 139 years differed with a mutual opinion’,” he said.
Colossia also refused that Maralees was still one of the most presidents of Latin America -- used the maritime problem as a political response.
"Whale never refuses his right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The rest is the possibility of seeing that we need to change the past."
North Korea suggests that nuclear divergence doesn't work because they can't trust the United States
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the North Korea Rio Yong Ho says that his country will never stop using his nuclear weapons, since he can't trust Washington.
Ri expressed the General Assembly on Saturday.
He had the United States to fulfill the promises achieved in Singapore's summer among leaders.
His comments come as the United States. The Guardian Mike Pampeo, properly, is at the border of the renewal of a nuclear stupid diplomatic with Kim Chan in North Korea, more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says that it's a "necessary sea" that the United States' long-term sanctions and anxiety against the declaration of the end of the war in Corea have ever set north-country.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if Phinea's will not start significant steps in the assembly.
And Kim, and the President of the United States, Donald Tromp needs to take a second suit.
But there's a big skepticism because Phoenian's rejecting the arsenal, which the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompea plans to visit Phoenix in a month to be prepared for the second Kim-Trump Same.
On the Paris modal indications we have seen the newest line in the massive main shoes on the way to the end in your towns
If you want to increase your header collection or close the sun, you can not search again.
The Valentino and Thom Browne designers represented a number of unusual major assemblies for their SS19 collection, which overcome the expectation of Paris Fashion Week.
In this year in Instagram, the father's ownership of the non-praktic capsules, which designers sent their faces to the pool.
The marvelous whisper of Valentino was a famous whistling hair, covered by the wide fields, covered on the pipes that filled the heads of the models.
Other accessors were unusually big sized included valuable coffee stones, the cap and even ananas, but they were not assigned to keep the head in this.
Thum Brown also showed the assembly of wisely masks - just once to Halloween.
Many of the diversity of the masks were broken with the mouths and more reminded Gunibal Lecter than a high mode.
One of them reminded the rubber for subcutaneous floating with the tube and the famous oaks, and the other is a positive to the spreaded conus of the wheat.
And when you're going to continue to keep the great attributes of the mode, you're happy.
Those who walk behind the style predetermine that great captains can go into our whole area of the same.
The heads of the big size go on the five to La Bomba, a salmon head with a width field of two feet, which can be seen in all, from Riana to Emily Ratiakovski.
The colt lab on a very inappropriate hair, which was split in social networks, looked on another big face on the powder, a stuck floor, the same big as the model of this cup clothed in the buyer.
The dark-arrancing tower from the rafia, covered by the rafia and covered by the white skin hand, became a white part in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the weekly mode in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitid said to FEMAIL, "I'm expecting to see big heads and floor towers in the main streets ago, since the designer has been a great influence, and it would be hard to ignore the temptation of non-governmental accommodations."
John Edward: Knowing the language is a needed science for all the citizens of the world.
Independent schools in Scotland have achieved academic success, this has continued since 2018 with another excellent result of tests that are promoted by individual and collective efforts in art, music and other social origins.
More than 30,000 students throughout Switzerland, schools represented by the Schotland Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to ensure the best level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for the next higher education, selected by their careers and their places as a citizen of the world.
As a educational sector that can develop and create a individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain a father's and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandel said, "If you talk to a man in the language he does, it's staying in his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, it's going to his heart."
It's a clear reminder of that we can't hope only in English if we want to build relationships and trust people in other countries.
From the results of the tests of this year, we see that the languages include the first places in the line tables with the highest calculations indicators in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages have received a higher sign A.
The data collected in SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students have been higher than A in Chinese education, while 72 percent are students in German, 69 percent are French, and 63 percent are Spanish, and also reached by A.
This shows that independent schools in Switzerland support for foreign languages as important sciences that, of course, need children and youths in the future.
Now the languages as the subject are chosen as the subjects of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in scientific programs and in other places.
Experience conducted by the Commission on Employment and Witness in 2014 by the fact that among the reasons that the workers have made in relation to difficulties in fulling opportunities were 17 per cent related to the failure of language habits.
So more and more language habits become needed to prepare young people for the future career.
With the account of more professional workplaces that require language knowledge, these sciences are needed in a globalized world.
If you learn a different language, it will be a real preference if you are going to have such habits in the same way.
The ability to contact directly with people from other countries to automatically put a multilingual person in the first place among competitors.
According to YouGov's interrogation, in which more than 4000 adult britains in 2013, 75 percent did not have enough good speech in a foreign language to speak, and the French was the only language in which two significant percent spoke 15 percent.
This is why investment in the language is now important for modern children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find good work.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the languages in which it is trained.
Sherag school is focused on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are most important for the Great Britain in view of the future until 2020, such as Mandary or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, in independent schools, there will always be a choice of a few languages with a teacher composite that is a specialist in this hall.
Shotland's independence schools are trying to ensure the educational environment that will help children and arm their habits necessary to achieve success, independent of what will be in the future.
Now we can't reject that in the worldwide business environment, the languages are already important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be considered as "the consciousness of international relations".
Independent schools will continue to propose this choice, diversity and preference for youth of Scotland.
It must be.
John Edward, Director of the Shatland Council of Independent Schools
Lebron debt on Sunday in San Diego
The beginning of the waiting for the clusters who want to see that Lebron James did his first start in Los Angeles Lakeers.
Luc Walton's trainer reported that James plays a pre-sessional opening on Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But a few minutes he's playing, you still need to determine.
"This will be more than 48," said Walton on the Lakeers' office site.
Correspondent Lakers Mike Trudell wrote that James, probably, will play in a limited minute.
According to the practice that happened this week, James asked about his plans for "six game pre-session graphs".
"I don't need pre-session games at this stage of career to prepare," he said.
Thumb in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
Today evening in Wiling, West Virginia, President Donald Tromp starts a lot of company action.
It's the first of the five planned expressions of Trump for a week, including a pipe in a friendly place, Tennessee and Mississippi.
When a vote is confirmed for elections to fill the Universal Court's opportunity, Trump is trying to strengthen the support of interim elections, as many republicans are risking to control Kongress when the votes are given in November.
When starts the trumpet tonight in Western Virginia and how can you look at it on the Internet?
ET tonight, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump in Western Virginia in the Internet below in YouTube right.
Trump, most likely, on this week, checks the candidate listening to the Court of Justice of Bretagne Kawano, who has problems with the opportunity of accusations in sexual inquiry with a expected confirmation in the Senate of voting during the investigation of the FBI.
But the main goal of these expressions is a story of help to the republicans standing before the election in November.
Thus, the Chairman's company Trompa said that these five expressions in the weeks were guided to "activate the activities of good and good-doers, as many republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of representatives", reports Ree··s.
"The Congress control is so important for his agenda that the president will go to the maximum number of states, since we enter into the pressed season of the pre-elective company," said the Agency Reiter's representative of the Trump.
Wesbanco Arena planned in Wiling, today's action can draw to Ahaio and Pennsylvania, and take attention to the MIMI Pitzburg,” reports The West Virginia Metro News.
The Sabbath will be the second time in the approximate month when Trump visited the West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump tries to help the candidate to the seat from the West Virginia Patrick Morris, who is a leader in experiences.
"This is not a very good sign for Morris that the president must come to try to give him a shot in the experience," said Simon Hedar, a policeman from the West Virginia University, reports Ree.
Cubak Rider 2018: The United States command is going to fight to keep hopes on the same weekend
After three one-side sessions on Saturday four, maybe they were just what they needed for this Cube Rider.
The puzzle has a completely designed sports conception, in which the players believe hardly, and nothing more than good associations.
So where would they say the impulse now?
"They've had six points, and now, four, so I think we're going through this with a little impulse," said Jordan Spy, spraying the day.
Eve's preferred, 7/ four points forward, and in the game still twelve.
The Americans, as Spyth says, feel that they have easily taken the wind, and they have nothing to hope, not in the end, because of the form of Spayth and Justine Thomas, who played together the whole day, and everyone can be enjoyed by three points of the four.
The spate was dead from the football to the green and is an example.
These garden cry of celebration became all the sounder as long as his earlier, and he buried an exhaustive shot to play in the bullet on the four fields when they and Thomas had fallen two per two.
It's anger, which allowed them to win in the 15th morning, was meet with a good cry, like the one who tells you that he believes that the American command is not disabled.
"You must just be deep and worry about your own mouth," said Spice.
Everyone of these players left.
18 offlines to make a mark.
In two days, only players who bought more points than Spayt and Thomas, are French Malinari and Tommy Flitwood, the unfortunate story of Cubka Rider.
It's wonderful, but what the couple in Eve's four of the four and they can't do anything tree.
Maliwood was the only couple that did not make `gi on Saturday, the second half day, but they also avoided `gi on Saturday morning, Friday and the second half day on Friday.
This happens, and how their energy, accordingly, runs to this furious crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are players who win on Sunday, and there would be no more father of a player to close the patent victory in Eve when the sun comes to Le Golf National than Flitwood or Malinary.
It's wanted to be at the same time in different areas.
The talk of Europe's glory remains timely.
Bubbe Watson and Web Simpson made a short work on Sergei Garcia, the hero of the early forest when he was in a couple with Alex Noren.
The gods and two twins on the previous nine shot the Spanish and the Swedish to him with which they did not go out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you with your bottle.
After four swords and four swords, it's so interesting to watch about interactions between the complex couples, the orders they give, the order they don't perform, and the way the technology can be changed to one moment.
Eve's dogetuel became the best command and took a significant role in the ap-days, but on this fourth meeting, it also shows that the U.S. command tries to fight, in which some were doubted, especially in the United States.
Eve's going to the final of Cubka Rider with 10-6
Eve's getting a good preference in the day of Cubka Rider after he's getting out of the fires of four swords and four with the preference of 10 to 6 over the United States.
The inspired duat of Tommy Flitwood and French Malinars have introduced a fight against a total victory over Tiger Woods to bring the results to Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas B'irn, trying to save the trafes that they spent in Hazeltin two years ago, was in the American inconvenience agency on the morning, getting a series of 3-1.
The U.S. had proposed greater opposition in the murder of four swords, wining two fats, but they couldn't do more.
To save the trophy, Jim Furic side needs eight points of 12 single patches on Sunday.
Flitwood is the first European beginner, who wined four points, and he and the Maliners who received the name Molliwood after sensational outcomes, it's only the second couple who wined four points for his first four points in the history of Cubka Ryder.
Though they destroyed Woods and Patrick Rid in four swords, they were marvelously moved to overcome the wounds and the American Naval Brisen Decomba even five and four.
Woods, who took himself through two bits on Saturday, showed a ransom flash, but now he lost 19 out of 29 times in the bullets of four swords and four and seven shops.
Justin Rowz, relaxed at the x-coats of four swords, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in the four bottles to the parse 2 and 1 Dossino Johnson and B.C. Copky, for one and another place in the world.
Eve had no way, though he was pleasant, fresh day on the south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, Jordan Spate and Justin Thomas set a control box for the Americans two points.
They gained the winning of 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter from Spain in four fats and returned later to overcome Puler and Rory McCallroy 4 and 3 in four, losing the dishes.
Thus twice in the history of Cubka Rayder the command returned from the efficiency of four points, which goes alone, even though at the side of the owners of Furica just needs to draw to save the trophy.
However, after the two ovals, which were the best, the contrast on Sunday looks like if they're all getting.
North Korea says that "no way" will be weapons in the same way without confidence
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs with North Korea stated that in Sabbath the Organization of the United Nations on the basis of sanctions that strengthen the unbelieving in the United States, and in such conditions, the country cannot reject nuclear weapons in the same order.
Ri Yun Ho stated annually to the General Assembly of the World Body that in the past year, North Korea adopted “valuable measures of good will”, for example, the stop of tests on nuclear and racket parts, the democratization of the nuclear area of tests and the promise to not distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see the corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"No confidence in the US will be confident in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way to worry ourselves first in the same way."
Unless believed that Ri republiced the usual North Korean complaints against Washington to the "poetope" approach to the dinuclearization, in the context of which the North Korea was refunded, as long as it took progressive steps, his commitment is significant in that he does not refuse the same deuclearization, which was the Phoenians in the mineral.
Ri rescued Kim Chen Ina and Donald Tromp at the first in the history of the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore, on 12 June, when Kim's killers worked on the way to the Korean Mediterranean Denuclearisation, the Trump promised to give security to North Korea.
North Korea is trying to end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States said Phoenyan should first be rejected from nuclear weapons.
Washington also worked for the derogation of the severe international sanctions in the context of North Korea.
"The United States are first insisting on "denuclearisation" and increased by pressure with the sanctions to achieve their goal in the way they are still opposed to "the end of the war", says Ri.
"The understanding of the sanctions can put us on the knees is an unfortunate martyr of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that our unbelievers are increasingly deep."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summer between Kim and Trumpham, which the U.S. manager mentioned before this week in the United Nations.
Instead of this, the Minister took note of three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jain in the approximately five months and added, "If this question was involved in Denuclearisation, the South Korea, not the United States, the Denomination of the Korean south-east would not become such a stupid."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was different from last year when he spoke in the United Nations General Assembly stated that the counterparty of the United States with the help of the North Korea's racket was unsecure after the "Mister President of the evil" Tromp called Kima as a "rakeholder" murder.
In this year, in the United Nations Tromp, who in the past year decreased the northern Korean 's destruction', thanked Kim for his courage in taking a measure of divorce, but said that there would be much more to do, and the sanctions must remain in force before that couple, where the North Korea is dinouclearized.
In the middle of Trump, he told that he had no timeline for this, saying, "If this takes two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are working in the United States. The Bishop Council stated that it was worth refunding Phoenyan for the measures taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary. Mike Pampea told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that "The execution of the Sanctions of the Council of Bispeki must be active and obliged to continue, since we are not sure of the full, end-end and dinuclearization."
The Bishpeki Council strengthened the sanctions to North Korea in 2006, trying to stop the financing of nuclear and balistic-rakeet programmes of Phinyan.
Pompea met Ri in the Collars of the Council of Bispeki, and the General Assembly later stated that in the months, he was going to visit Phoenyan again to be prepared for the self-society.
Pampea visited North Korea for three times this year, but his approximation was not successful.
In the coast, he left Phoenyan, saying that the progress from North Korea has reached for several hours of speech, has ended with the vice declaration that he has proposed the requirement of "compliantly to the gangsters".
At the meeting with Mona this month, Northern Korea has been able to visit the racket installation and nuclear complex when the United States takes the appropriate measures.
The Trump said that, according to Kima, "the appropriate measures" that he expects is a guarantee of security and an effort to normalize with Washington, which Trump promised to Singapore.
Harvard's students are running a course of rest.
The new course of the Harvard University in this year must teach students more sleeping, and my goal is to fight the culture to learn with coffee night in the hand.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students in one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to watch themselves and their devotion.
Chasler, a medical professor of the Harvard Medical School and a specialist of the hospital name Brigame and a woman's hospital, developed a course, which, in his opinion, was the first in his kind in the United States.
The inspired expression of the impact of the inappropriate sleep on teaching, he started a course.
At the end of the lesson, one girl came to me and said, "Why have you told me this just now, at the learning course?"
"He said that no one never told her about the importance of sleep -- it was my surprise," he said the Telegraph.
First in this year, the course made by students explains why good dream habits are adequate and sporting achievement, and improve the general advice.
Paul Barrey, professor of psychiatries at Harvard Medical School and executing a director of the university, said that the university decided to introduce a course after he discovered that students were often sleeping during you.
The curve that takes an hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there's a picture of rooms in the Internet where students press on coffee, phirants and books that tell about the impact of coffee and light and how an inappropriate sleep affects sports indicators, as well as the importance of the habits before the sleep.
At the full stage, the participants explain how a multi-year sleeping can increase the risk of harder attacks, advisers, depression and cancer.
The cart of the combustion, with interactive characteristics, is to think about the same thing.
"We know that it doesn't change the behaviour of students right now.
But we think they have to know that as they all know about the curse of devotion," added Professor Chasler.
According to his words, the culture of the nightmare before, adding that modern technology and continuously growing pressure on students leads to the salvation of sleep, which is a greater problem.
“The enough good quality dream must be a secret weapon students to fight the stress, distress and anxiety,” he said, “and to avoid the low weight, as long as the brain is continually hungry”.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student who studies chemical and physical biologic, helped Professor Chaseler to develop a course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach all of them in the campus.
He hopes that a step will be requested to all the asyrants to complete an analogue education program before the university arrives.
Professor Chasler recommended the students to set an opportunity to know when to go to sleep and when wake up, noting the damage of the blue light, which is drawn out from monitor monitors and lightweights, which can change the proper way that leads to a problem with sleep.
Lewingstan 1:0, Rangers: Manga's killing Gerard's goal.
Rangers suffered another parasite when Holly Doli Mangie assured that Stephen Jerard would not receive a parade 1:0 at Lewingstan stadium.
Ibrax wants to write his first victory on the way to triumph with 4-1 in February in St. Jonton, but the command of Gerry Holton takes only the second parasite of Jerard as a manager of 18 games to leave on his side eight points, from the leaders of Ladbrokes Hearts.
Manga was killed in seven minutes before the front, and Rangers' command, inspired voice, didn't look like to suffer the parasy.
At the same time, when Rangers goes to the sixth place, Lewingstan was taken up to the third place, and behind the Hibernain remains with the difference in the swords.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems after the Forward Column Spencer should treat the harm of his head after his occurrence of an object, kicked out of the tribe.
Jerard made eight changes of players, because Ira didn't play in the middle of Cubco Bethfred.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Lewi under 11 rooms, which allowed to take the point from Hearts for the last week, and was in the west of the way they were well on every step away from their adversaries.
Rangers had a better sword, but Libygstan tried to kill the sword.
They had to have killed all over a minute when the first time Mangy moved the sword through Scott Pitman to the gates of Alan Gregger, and then the backward used this chance.
The successful strife of Jacob Caegon sing to Craig Hallet, but his partner in the protection of Alan Lithu has been able to bring a strong wound behind.
Rangers got controlled, but the third of the games were more hoped to kill than demonstrate a good game.
Alfred Mareshall, of course, had to be a trip in a fourth hour to the end when he and Steven Lowles met on the field, but judge Steven Tomson did not accept the complaint of Colombia.
Rangers was able to shoot the gate only in the first half game, but the former Ibrox Liam Caley had almost not given Lacena Kulibala and the effective attack of Avi Aharia.
Although killing the first hole for the 34th minute of Levi, he might have been against the next active game, but nobody refuses that they have to show a good game.
Rangers hasn't been able to get Jacob's gate again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Galaher gave Scott Robinson's back, who blocked Manga to get the possibility of killing in the gate.
Jerard was replaced by the Culibalians in Ryan Kent, and this is an effective effect when attacking passed to Marel, but the impressioning Caly fled and locked the hit.
But Lewingstan continued to enjoy visitors, playing in the game that just liked them, and Lithua and Halket worked to share the sword after long opposition.
Bock Holt was able to overcome only for a few minutes, but Greggar played good to resist Jacobs before Lithuania went on the backup.
The replacement of Rangers Glen Middleton happened in a cycle once after the trap, when he met Jacobs, but Tomson was able to flee.
Almagne: The finder of Gayger's calculator.
The page of our almanache is on 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and PADLIK... the day of the future physician Ihagana Wilhelm Hans Gageer, who was born in Germany.
Gayger developed the method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, which resulted in the presentation of the device, as a Gager counter.
Gayger became a part of the science and appeared in the pop culture, as in the 1950 film of the Caranada, in which those participants seemed to be younger students, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is the Gayger's calculator, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put a scientist, you really have the possibility of hearing the sounds of atoms that give radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, is this really really needed now?"
Hans Gayger died in 1945, all over a few years to the 63th of the birthday.
But the findings that wear his name continue to use.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system to see cancer cells.
A new antiviral vaccine can help the immune system to “see” the tree cells and destroy them.
This vaccine is as if the immune system is learning to recognize the tree cells that will be part of the treatment.
The method provides the receipt of immune cells from the patient and changes them in the lab.
Then the cells can "see" a white spread in many cancer cells and then repeat the help cells.
The test vaccine is a successful result for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was introduced in a vaccine, which helps the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw that the cancer of the cancers was lost for 18 months.
The method includes the receipt of immune cells in the patient, the change in the laboratory so that they can "see" HER2, general for many cancer cells, and then it will be repeatedly entered.
This is what Professor Jay Berzofski of the United States National Race Institute in Maryland, and our results show that there is a very prospective vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several species of anti-rack cells that fight with the cancer of a small-small-shirt-shirt-shirt, light-foot-foot-foot-foot-case," said Professor Berazofski.
A suitable approach to detection of immune cells in patients and "learning" to reach cancer cells well worked in the treatment of leucose.
Connie West approached the debate in support of Trump, holding the title of the MAGA, after his presentation to SNL.
What wasn't missing well.
In the study during the Sunday evening, Caine West was disappointed after his statement, where he was concerned with the United States. President Donald Tromp said that it would be a second time in 2020.
After his third song, when he was in the "Doing America again big" chapter, he spoke against democrats and confirmed his support to Trump.
"How many times I'm talking to the white people, and they said, "How can you support the Trump, he's growing?"
"Well, if I was worried about discipline, I would have left America for a long time," he said.

Nothing, or did Rock try to deal with the West.
Moreover, West was accused of the public that he had a hard time behind the bullets.
They rejoiced on me after the bullets.
They said, "Don't get out of this cow.
They thanked me.
"And then they say I'm in a guilty place," he said, as the newspaper the Washington Examiner reports.
The West continued: Do you want to see a guilty place? "I mean he's" I'm gonna put my speech in Scormen, which means he's not able to do with me what he's doing.
Try to love.
Because of his statements, at least two times listened, and the SNS representatives were confused with the message from Veraiti.

Wast surprised by a lot of performing a song I Love It, clothed in the water bottle of Per.
Wells received support from the TUSA Conservative Party manager, Candes Terner, who wrote in the Twitter, "Only of the most courageous spirits thank you for support."
But leading to-shot Caren Hunter wrote that West is just the one who he is, and it's always wonderful.
"But I decided not to recompense anybody by buying it or clothing, or by supporting his "art" which I think, increasing and disappointing the ideology that causes the damage to my partner.
He's free.
Like we," she added.
Before the reper switched in Twitter, he changed his name by saying that now he was "officially called Caney West".
He wasn't the first art that changed his name, and went after Granddy's seats, also known as Puff Didi.
His colleague Reper Snoop Dogg was called the Snoop Lion's cousin, and, at the same time, the End's, who changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the art, before known as a cow.

China reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
According to the information of the guard workers, more than 820 000 people were infected in the country.

Because of conservative values in the country, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men, finally marry women.
Many diseases are distributed from insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Government of China was a universal access to HIV medicines in the context of efforts to solve this global problem.

"This undesigned statement is completely false and absolutely disgusting," was Wooters' work.
"The members of my command, whose personal information and security have been complied with the result of these azukans and religious accusations, nor did he at any time refuse to escape this information.
It's an uninterpreted statement which is completely false and absolutely disgusting."
The Wooters Zawl soon you've put a criticism on the Internet, in that number from the former president of the White House of Ari Flasher.

Johnny English Strikes Again's looking forward to the invented span of Rowen Atkinson.
Now it was a tradition to look for the meaning of BREEXITE in any new film with British wheel, and this angle seems to be in the commodity and ex-fresh Johnny Inglish, which was still started in 2003 with Johnny Inglish and was spent in 2011.
Is it possible that the satyre expresses a good reason for how unlikely we look when we talk about the new possibilities of export?
In any case, the second time he appeared in a section, the uncompetent Johnny Inglish got the opportunity to smile over things -- his name was more sounder than all the comic characters that he did for no English viewers in the cinematography.
Of course, he's a secret agent who, unless believed in his wise prospects on the glomour, got a little favorable to Cluzo with the rises of the master's and a little guy who brought the only note to Hor the fire on the civilization of the opening of the Alympiade in London in 2012.
First, his person was based on the wanda and the international mysteries of Atkinson, who ever played in the forgotten Barclockard, leaveing the chaos on his way.
There's a few pleasant moments that haven't been before.
I loved Johnny England, who is close to the road, dressed in the middle of the everlasting prosperity, and the shooting of the rotor a little swimming over his screen.
The Dar Atkinson for the theatrical comediation is a light dama, but the humor is feeling fun, and so wonderfully when serious movies such as "Agent 007: Mission is unusual" are probably proposed as a major part.
The humor feels as if it's not only for adults but also for children, and even unfortunate accidents of Johnny England are not as discoverable as the silent films of Atkinson in a person.
A many-year-old current plan is the serious problems of the Great Britain.
Kiber-hacker prosecution in the super-secret Society of British Spain in the United Kingdom, opening the names of all British agents in the places, to disappoint the South Agency is, of course, the small role of Kevin Eldan.
It's an appointment to the p'er minister, which is a genial and mixed act that is always aware of a political incompatibleness: Emma Tompson does all that is possible with this Question Teresai-May, but there's nothing like this in the scenario.
Her divorce advisers report that as long as everyone of the daily spion will be discovered, she will have to activate one of those who are already on the pension.
And this means that for Johnny English himself, it's all combined: now he's working as a sixth teacher in a few shocking institutions, and he's learning how to be an unexpected operator: some good examples here, how many English offers the Academy Music Lection of Spying.
England returned to Whitehol for a foreign brifing and joined his former long-term friend Bo, who is playing Ben Miller again.
Today, because I have a marriage connected to the commander of the underwater ship, the role of which the Pepperdin's played a little deceitful.
So Bethman and Robin gets terriblely wrong things in the secret agency of the Queen, where they work again, met with the beautiful Woolgay Kurilenka woman.
Among them, Mr'er Minister receives an uncertain command of a charismical billion, which suggests that it can solve problems with hackers in the United States: with the most important Jason Walt, which is playing James Lacey.
England and Bou start their exhibition from the immediate things: to be locked under the officer, to burn the French restaurant; to create a grave, to fight with the contrabandists on the fight of the nice jacket of Walt; English makes a clean anioy, for he is trying to use the garniture of virtual reality to recognize the interior of the house of Walt.
All the moments to get out for an event, but the same pleasant and sound, in which there's a lot of kid in the television.
Very good material.
And how about other films about Johnny England I couldn't think, can't the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demo is his talent?
The Library party refuses to develop a plan for payment to the British four-year-old workers you're paying for five.
The Jeremy Corbin's work party must consider a pleasant plan if the British only work four days a week, but pay for five.
As it is reported, the party wants the business managers to give the work results, which resulted in the revolution of art intelligence, giving them an additional outcome date.
It was seen that the workers will be enjoyed from the three of the outcomes, but all will be able to get the same job.
The source indicates that the idea corresponds to the economic program of the party and plans to direct the country to the support of workers.
From the prophecies, the four-year-year-by-week moves as a good way to use changes in the economy.
The older source in the Library party explained for the Sunday Times: “The planned review of actions will be announced until the end of the year.
It's not going to happen now, but the four-year working weeks are the idea that matches the view of the party and the general industrial regulation of the economy for the benefit of the employees.
The Library party is not the first one who takes such a idea, the Green Party promises to carry out four working weeks during the general choice company in 2017.
However, the Library party's effort is not supported.
The representative of the Library Party said, "The four-year working weeks are not a party policy, and it is not a party.
Concler John Holddonel used a labour conference for the last week to see your socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. Donnel said he decided to return the authority from the "professional Directors" and "manageries" to communal companies.
The plans of the console also suggest that the current water resource actor could not return all the package of action, because the Leabarist government can make a "recommendation" based on the measured positions.
He also confirmed that it was planning to introduce workers in a set of company advice and to create united property funds to deliver 10 percent of their own tools to a private company that would hold annual divisions to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said for '60 minutes', that the FBI, who works with Kawano, must change its opinion.
The FBI survey of accusations to the Court of Bretagne Cavano was responsible for a final vote on its choice in the Court of Justice at least a week. A question is whether the outcome of the Republican Senators and the support of the Office.
In the interview of Epherus on Sunday, Scott Pelly asked in the Republic of Johnny Candy and Lindsey Grech about Sens, whether the FBI could discover everything that could lead to changes.
Candy seemed more open than his colleague with the South Korea.
"I mean, '," said Kennedy.
"I said by going to the court: I spoke from the Court of Cavano.
I've been able to tell him after it happened, and I asked about the reason of accusation, and asked, "You did this?"
He was decided and specific."
Gram's gallery, however, seems to be final.
"I think Bret Kawano decided that it would be a scandal accusation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brat rejects this," added Graham, linking Christine Blays Ford.
"And everyone who she calls is not able to believe it.
She's just 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What's the International Fiscal of the citizens, and what's for the decrease of poverty?
In the Sabbath in New York, the International Fiscal is the annual musical operation, which has a very impressive composition of speakers and artists and my mission to stop poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Fiscal of the Civility will occur on the large part of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert of Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Shawn Mendes, as well as to learn about the objective of the operation -- the stop of poverty and the delay until 2030.
The international festival of the citizens, which appeared in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Anti-Group of the international propaganda group, which hopes to stop poverty for the increase in the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free white on a mechanism (if you don't want to pay VIP billet) the visitor had to perform a series of tasks or a 'control action', to be a current, to write by the country's leader's email, to identify any other actions and to increase the knowledge of the point of the delay of poverty.
But how successful was the citizen's fictival for 12 years and could he reach his goal?
Is it the idea of repealing people with a costless concert with a way to convince people of the need for active actions, or is it just another case called "Twismus" -- people feel that they do good in the way of signing online-petition or sending you?
Since 2011, the physician organ states that they have fixed more than 19 million "actions" from their adherents who are trying to achieve various objectives.
It states that these actions have been increasingly undertaken by the influence leaders to carry out obligations for more than 37 billion dollars, which can affect more than 2,25 billion people until 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group brought 390 comments on obligations and claimed at least 10 billion dollars, which have already been allocated or collected.
According to the evaluation of the group, the resources that have been identified before this time have been affected by 649 million people around the world.
The key obligations include food supply, investment partnerships and artists based in Greece, "help for children to develop in full amount", promised to ensure Rwanda 35 million dollars to help prevent failure in the country after receiving more than 4700 minutes from the citizens.
"In support of the Government of the Great Britain, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can create social injustice in history," said Ambassador Tracy Ulman in London in October 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5000 actions were carried out in the United Kingdom to improve food for the material and children, the Government reported on the funding of the "food assistance", which reaches 5 million women and children with food problems.
In response to one of the parts of questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end the poverty?"
It's a long and hard way, sometimes we'll suffer the parasy and do.
But as the great citizen rights and movements against the apartment, we're going to get back, because together we're stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Shawn Mendes, Cardy B, Janel Monae, are one of the series of personers who are in this year in New York, which will lead Debora Lee Ferness and HJ Jackman.
US VMS can be used for blocks to overcome the export of Russian oil and gas
"Wassington may, if necessary, turn to the military-marine float to produce the outcome of the Russian energy on the EU and the Near East markets," states the US Secretary Ryan Zink, reports Washington Examiner.
Zink said that Russia's actions in Syria, especially where it works on the invitation of legal government, are a basis for learning new energy markets.
"I believe that the cause of their stay on the Near East is that they want to buy energy as in East Eastern and South Eastern Eastern," he said.
And, according to the factor, there are ways and tools to handle this.
"The United States have the possibility to ensure the openness of the sea roads with the help of the military-mary flood, and if they need, to organize blocks so that their energy may not have been on the market," he said.
Zinke returned to the members of the operation, the organ of the Allians of energy consumers, an increasing group that positions itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared the approaches of Washington to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually equal.

These statements appeared at the time when the Trumpa administration wants to increase the export of its debugged natural gas to Eve, replaceing Russia, which is much more dancing for European consumers.
For this workers of the Trump, including the US President Donald Tromp, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the "incorrect" guest "North Flood 2", which, according to Trump, converted Berlin to the "Polne" Moscow.
Moscow once highlighted that the North Flood 2 gas costs 11 billion dollars, which is created to double the power of the gas right to 110 billion cubic metres, is exclusively economic responsibility.
Crawl states that Washington's severe position takes the start in the economy and is an example of an incompatible competition.
"I think we have the only view that energy can't be a pressure tool and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting the United States Energy Ministry of Peri in September in Moscow.
The Americans have received a wound in response from Germany, which again confirmed their kindness.
The main German organization, which represents industriality, the Federation of German industrialists (BDI) for the United States has not been involved in the EU energy policy and the two-side memories between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country is involved in our energy supply," said Deuter Camp, Chapter of the German Industries Federation (BDI) after the recent meeting between the Officer of the Germany of Angle Mercel and the President of Russian Uladimir Putin.

The American area accuses China in a threat with the use of the "prognostic advertising"
In a week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-side advertising in the American that's agency, discouraging the mutual benefits of the American Chinese band, the American officer in China accused Pekin to use the American press to distribute propaganda.
The American President Donald Tromp mentioned the Chinese Daily supplier in Des Moines Register, the most selling guest of Aya, after the accusation of China in the choice of the American Cangres on November 6, this is the accusation of China.
The Trump's accusation that China tried to move in American elections indicated that American official persons were called in the conversation with Re·s a new phase in Washington's company by pressure in China.
Although the statement of foreign governments is a normal practice for the movement of a band, now Pekin and Washington have joined a trade war, the result of a mutual import tariff.
Repressive tariffs, stated by American and Chinese experts, were introduced to find such experts as Aya's representatives who support the Republic of Trompa.
Terry Branded, the United States officer in China and the former Governor of Iowa, the chief farmer of farmers in China, stated that Pekin had damaged the American slave, farmer and businessmen.

"When the Chinese government distributes its propaganda, it uses a good American tradition of freedom of word and free presses, impliing a statement in Des Moines Register," wrote Branded.
"And when you look at the newspapers in Peking, you'll find not so many votes against and you'll not see the real reflection of other measures that can have Chineses in the economy's uncertain tractory, that is not the fact that the press is under the railway fifth Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused to propose" over his article, even though he didn't call this journal.
The Republics reject women-electors before the previous intermediate elections from Fiscal Kawano, warning analyses
While many known republicians protect the candidate to the office of the Supreme Court of Bretagne Kawano from the face of a few accusations in a sexual wheel, the analytics warned that they would have an impact on the response, especially from women, during the future intermediate elections.
The emotions around it were very strong, and most of the Republicans always show that they are ready to vote.
"These things can't be returned," said Grant Richar, a professor of the Political School of the Syracus University of the "The Hill" University for the article, which was held over the Sabbath.
Richard said that it was uncertain that the statements of Senator Jeff Fleeco (Arizona) about the investigation from the FBI would be sufficient to relax the broken choices.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow and in November," Karin Jean-Pher said on Friday, the main adviser and the National President of MoveOn's progressive group from Washington, around Colombia.
On fifth morning, protestants shot the "Listapad Quick" during the demonstration in the Senate Hall, when the republicans who control the legal committee decided to remove the Kawano candidate without the statement of the Christian Blace Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and the motivation of democrats will be in general big," the new website of St. Rottenberg, an independent political analysis.
"The people say they're almost high, and it's yes.
But they can be even higher, especially among women-exhibitors in the forests and young electors from 18 to 29 years, who do not like the president, but often do not vote."
Even before the open statement of Ford, in which she detailed its accusation of the candidate to the Court of Justice in sex, analytics believe that if the republicans are attained to confirmation, they may have a strong place in response.
"For the Republican Party, this has been made a mixed mechanism," said Michael Stil, the former ex-committee of the National Republican Party at the beginning of the past, according to NBC News.
"The talk is not about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or about Kawano on the past, but about how the republicans have done this and how they have set it," notes Gay Sesil's new channel, the US Priorities Director, a group that helps to choose democrats.
However, it is appropriate that the Americans were divided into the right of Ford or Kawano, which causes a little more than the applause.
The new YouGov experience shows that 41 percent of the representatives are sure or not very sure to trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent have said that they're sure or not very certain to trust Kawano.
Moreover, 38 percent said that, in their opinion, Kawano might or probably heard in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After a flake of the FBI investigates the accusations from Ford, and at least another person, Debory Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
In the last week, Ford made a statement under the swear by the Secretary Committee of Senata, that Kawano, when he was drunk, was asked for her at a 17-year-old age.
Ramirez states that the candidate in the Court of Justice demonstrated her genitality at evening when they learned in Eile in 1980.
The worldwide network finder plans to start a New Internet to create Google and Facebook competitions
This Berners-Lee, a worldwide network finder, starts a start that will be made by Facebook, Amazon, and Google competitors.
The last technology, Inrupt, is a company built in the open form of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows the user to choose the location to store the data and who has the permission of access to this information.
In the Exclusive Fast Company Berners-Lee interview, he said, by creating Inrupt, he meaning "bearing over the world".
"You must do it now," he said about the start.
"This is a historical moment."
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create a "private repository of data on the Internet" or POD.
This can contain lists of contacts, lists, calendars, fans and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
The uniqueness of the personal repository of the Internet is that only the user defines who has access to the type of information.
The company calls it "a strong personal patent with data help".
In the opinion of the Executive Directory of John Bruce's company, Inrupt's idea of creation gives the company the possibility to communicate with resources, processes and needed sciences to make Solid available to each.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the forms of security that IBM bought, several developers who work on the contract and every walent.
Starting with this, developers of technology throughout the world can create own decentralised programs using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brothers-Lee said he and his command did not talk to "Facebook and Google about it, to introduce or not full changes when all their business models will be checked instantly.
"We do not ask them for permission."
In the Sabbath publication on Medium Berners-Lee, Inrupt's mission "is a security of camera energy and ecosystems for the protection of integrity and the quality of a new network created by Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a Consorcium of the World Network in the Massachusettian Technology Institute.
In the past months, Berners-Lee was very influenced by the neutrality of the network.
Even by starting Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the leader and the Director of the World Network, the Network Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic at the new time of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Honouring the Holy Holy Christmas in the First World War
The only sanctuary of the English Church, who was born by the Cross during the First World War, was signed in his city for 100 years.
On September 29, 1918, Bernard Van was injured for the attack under Belenglis and Leakur.
However, in four days he died from the cow of the sniper and never learned that he had received the greatest British military recompense.
On Saturday in the town of Rashen, the grave of Narthgemptonshir two of his teens on the advice opened a memory stone.
One of his teenagers, Michael Van, said that it was "very symbolic" that the stone was opened in 100 years after his grandfather was born.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Duchess Van was carrying his battle through the channel of San Queentin's "super a swimming egg and under a strong rose and cool fire of the worker."
Then he fled to the fire line, and "with great courage" led a soldier forward, self-shopping the harm and killing three subdivisions.
The Colonel Van was killed by the German Sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month after the war ended.
A 72-year-old Michael Van said his grandfather's actions were "a thing I could never do, and something worthwhile."
He and his brother James Van also set a bridge after the advice, which signed the Imperial little real archester Brandwood.
Michael Van said, "for his great honour to take part in the advice" and added that "the mastership of the hero was shown by the support of many."
The MMA fans all night waited to look at Bellator 206, they got a pepa glass instead
Imagine that you've left the whole night to see the compressed transfer from Bellator 206, and then they're refusing you to see the main event.
In San Hasse's program, there were 13 battles, including six on the main card, and they were shown in the right efficiency all night at the British phone Channel 5.
And the sixth morning, when Gerar Musassi and Rory Donald were thrown up to the box, looking at the Great Britain, they were just ashled when the program changed to Pepa's snow.
The architectures were disappointed after they made an unfortunate night, particularly waiting for this fight.
One of Twitter's balls called a change to a child's mutilator as a "think's stupid crazy."
In response to the translation of Dave Schwartz, the older Vice-President Bellator on the marketing and communications issues, he said, "The State statement agrees and the 6th morning it was unexpected and it was necessary to move to the child's program."
"Yes, Swinka Pepa."
The president of the Bellator Scott Cocker company said that in the future they would work on a program to count British viewers.
"I think we are looking forward to the possibility of repeating, I think we can resolve this question," said Koker.
"But now the sixth morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to decide it until Sunday for our time, and this is Monday for their time.
But we do everything possible.
Trust, when the programs were memorized, we got a lot of messages and not all they were friendly.
We tried to resolve a question, calculating that it was a technical failure.
But it's a state position.
I can imagine that it's not going to happen together.
We're going to have the number of six to five, as we do, and usually, this time we wanted to advise the →, but we're old.
It's a great situation."
"Display of a non-human island," Tom Daily felt "insignificant" because of sexuality.
The alympian spectacle in the waters of Tom Daily said that he grows with a sense of insignificantness for others because of his sexuality -- but that gave him a motivation on the way to quickly.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't say that "not all like me" hadn't gone to the middle school.
By speaking in the "Disco of Unusual Island" radio 4 in the leader Lauren Lavern, he said that he supports the rights of gays to continue with another "hope".
Also he said that when his child appeared, he began less to think about the victory of the alympiade.
The traditional leader of this very old program of Kirsti Young took a rest for a few months because of the disease.
In the role of a man who went on an inhuman island, in the first Lavern program, Daily said that in childhood he felt "small" than all others, because "the society did not accept those who loved the boys and the girls."
He said, "I now think that this feeling of you're not like everything and that you're not as important, it was the one who gave me power and inspiration for a success."
He wanted to -- that was a "knowledge", he said that he wouldn't deceive those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-fold bronzed aluminium is made a significant activity of the LGBT movement and the Society Games in Australia in this year for the country to not criminalize homosexuals.
He said that he expressed his opinion, because he felt happy to live open, without persecution and wanted to give a hope to another.
The three-fold world pion said that when he was in love with a man, the American center, the directors, and the Dustin Lance Blake, with whom he met in 2013, "This was unexpected for me."
Daily married the owner of Oscar, who for 20 years older than him, in the past year, but, according to his words, the difference in adults doesn't mean.
"If you're going through this in such a young age," at the first alympiade he'd occur at the 14th age, and three years ago his father died from the cancer -- he said it was hard to find a journalist who would survive such wounds and falls.
In June, they made their parents, their son named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daily said that his "complete" was changed.
"If you asked me in the past year, I would tell you that I need to win the golden medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the gold of the alympic medal.
Robbie is my golden alympic medal."
His son is also called as his father, Robert. His father died in 2011 in a 40-year-old brain cancer.
Daily said that his father didn't accept the fact that he died and one of the things he asked was whether they bought whites at London's alympiade in 2012 -- he wanted to sit in the first series.
"I couldn't have with him," you're not going to sit in the first series, Dad," he said.
"I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
In the year 2012, Daily was a partnership with the aluminium, and you win a bronze medal.
"I just knew that it was just the same thing that I was going to get into water before my bottles on the Alympias games, it's the best feeling," he said.
It also went to the choice of a song - Proud from Heather Smole - which found a sound in it in preparation for the alympias and from which the moods are running.
"Unusual island discs" can be listened to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 at the British aeroplane.
Michaelson, who is not in the form, remains on the lock of the reserves in the Rider's cube on Saturday
The American Phil Michaelson on Sunday puts a record by playing his 47 bitches in the Rider Cube, but he needs to return the form so that this event doesn't make an accident.
Michaelson, who's going to play in this companion, which is going on on a time in two years, recurrent 12 times, the captain of Jim Furrik was sitting on the lock of the backers on the shadow of the forbulle.
Instead of being in the center of the event, and he was there often for the United States' command, the five-fold winner of the cube divided his days between the work of the chirurg and the trees, trying to return to the form.
Even on the pig of his career he wasn't the best player, and now the 48-year-old galfist is not a ideal choice for the inevitable Le Golf National field, where heavy is unfair.
And if the field is insufficiently dark, Michaelson in the ninth morning will fight against the exact British Open France Maliners, who and Tommy Flitwood wined all four mads in this week.
If the Americans who stay at the four points at the beginning of 12 single points start from the swimming, Michaelson's mother may appear to be the most important thing.
The phurician showed confidence in this player, but nothing more could be done with.
"He's full of his role today, put me on the back, shoot me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Phuric.
"He's very sure in himself.
He was taken into the Hall of glory and gave a lot of commands in the minute and in this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two pieces.
I planned more, but I worked just so and so we thought to play.
He wants to be in the field, as well as all the others."
Michaelson's killing Nick Fall's record by the number of murders in the Rider's cube, played on Sunday.
This may be the end of the career in the Rider's cube, which never was the same as reaching in individual games.
In Michaelson, 18 wins, 20 players and seven halfs, the house of Furrik said that his presence brought a command of benefit.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with the humor, likes to pick up people and just a very good man who is good in the command," he explained.
"I think the younger players with a pleasant paired his worsts, too in this week, and it was good to see.
He gives a command much more than just a game."
Captain of the European command to Thomas B'irn knows that the big degree can quickly disappear
Thomas Burn, the captain of the European command, knows from the experience that the importance of a break before the individual players of the day on the Rider Cube can easily disappear.
The Danish player debates in Walderham in 1997, where the European command under Seva Balesteros was preferred to five points over the Americans, but finished with the minimum preference of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding you that we had a great privilege in Walderam, but with difficulty we had a big preference in Blivia where we were lost," Burn said after a review of how the Class of 2018 wined 5-3 and Friday, and yesterday, and we took 10 to 6 on Le Golf National.
"The story shows me and all the other in the order that it's not the end yet.
Tomorrow you have to play at all hundreds.
Get out of the field and do everything about it.
The points have not appeared in the table, nothing has been completed.
We have a goal, and this is a trial to win this trophy, that's what we're doing and focusing on.
I'm still saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're very good to realize that there are the best players in the world."
Happy to play his players in a hard field for golf, B'irn added, "I will never consider it.
It will be a different game tomorrow.
Tomorrow will be individual games, and this is fully different.
It's just great if you're in the field with a partner and everything's going good, but if you're playing one, you're playing with your talents of galfist.
That's what you need to give to the players that they have to be the best tomorrow.
Now you need to leave a partner, and they need to go, and too, everything better as a individual player."
On the contrary to Burn, his companion Jim Furrik is hoped for the best individual game of his sportsmen than the one they demonstrated in partnership, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points of four.
The Officer himself was on both sides of these shoes on the day, playing in a vital command in B. Line and playing when Eve had the "Wood in Medina".
"I remember every word of this," he said, responding to the question how Ben Cransho, the captain, 1999, set up his players for an ape-day.
"We have 12 important points tomorrow, but we always want to have a quick start that you saw in B'Line and Medina.
When the speed grows, the biggest pressure appears on those who play the middle of the middle.
We set a suitable layout and set players as we liked, and you know, tomorrow we're trying to get a little magic."
Thomas got the task to start playing and speaking against Rory McCallroy in the main muck, and Paul Casey, Justin Rowz, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and John Pauler will play against the galfists.
"I put my players in such a way, because I think I'm gonna close everything," Burn said about his choices for individual points.
A new German military ship has been relocated
The new VMF Germany had to enter into the station in 2014 to replace old wars during the Cold War, but it appeared no longer a year ago because of a weak system and constantly increased costs, according to local MME messages.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz", of the main ship of the absolutely new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg frequency, was resigned to the first half of 2019, as the journal Die Zeit quoted by a military representative.
The ship was supposed to enter into the ship in 2014, but the problems that occurred after the building prevented this ambitious.
Four warriors of Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered yet in 2007, have to replace the old bremen class fragments.
They will be armed by powerful harms, different against rackets, and some steel technology, such as reduced vision for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
One of the other important characteristics is a longer period between the technology, and more new frequency can't go into their gates for two years.
However, constant terms indicate that modern battles, which can allow Germany to demonstrate their power outside the country, are older until they finally entered into the building, indicates The Time.
The unfortunate F125 fragment occurred in a heading in the past year when German WMF officially refused to take a ship and returned its Blohm & Voss to Hamburg.
First, the Vaenna-Mary float returned the ship to the ship after the delivery.
The reason for returning a little, but the German MMEs wrote about many "effects in software security and equipment" that make a ship married in a battle mission.
The program security was especially important, because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class's only 120 matros -- half of the old frequencies of Bremen.
It also appeared that the ship has a very large weight that reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further updates.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" means 7000 tons, which is more than the weight of ships of a good class used by Germany in the Second World War.
In addition to the lack of the price of all, including the education of the economy, it is also a problem.
Cana has reached 3,1 billion euros (3,6 billion dollars) — although it first costs 2,2 billion euros.
The problems that are covered with new frequencies are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's sea power is reduced.
At the beginning of this year, Hans Peter Bartels, the head of the Protection Committee in the German Parliament, stated that the VMF has "all less ships eligible for military missions".
He said that the problem of sometimes increases because the old blads are listed, and the ships are not replaced.
He deceived that no of Baden-Wuerttemberg's frequencies could be able to join the VMF.
The national association by the wallet memories listened to the secret of the same talks
A new research that is conducted in the Switzerland narrow is guided to determine how the speakers use the landscape for food feeding.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behaviour of unclean flying milk and helping in future actions in the storage of these animals.
The research of the students of the National Reserve Company of Scotland's memories is made for small speakers and also a storm of long-term Dabbanton's speakers in Invery Gardens in Western Ross.
The special record devices will be placed in the main places of this location in order to watch the talks during the session.
Company workers and currencies will conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
A expert analysis of all records has been defined by the frequency of your speakers, as well as what they're doing.
The map of life and delivery will be used to create a detailed image of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Djoar, a advisor of the National Association on the conservation of nature, hopes to show the results of which areas are most important for speakers and how they use each of the species.
This information will help to determine the preferences for the creation of residence places such as a bully, and how to support boss to live talks and other animals related to them.
The number of speakers in Scotland and Great Britain has been very decreased in the past centuries.
They defeat building and developing works that affect the place of living and destroy them.
The wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as white sources for muscles and some chemicals for building materials.
It's not totally sealed.
However, because of them the same night's ears of talks are more hearing than the eyes when the talk is about moving.
They use a complicated echo technology to detect sugars and hinders on the road of the flight.
The national association, responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of earth throughout the country, is very serious to speak.
It works with ten learned experts who are regularly conducting research, testing places of life, and sometimes rescuing measures.
The orga is even created the first and the only Shotland speaker in the Moon Trive in Damfreis and Galaway, where it lives eight of the ten species of Shootland speakers.
The Mainman David Thomas says that this is an ideal territory for talks.
"There, in Trive, we have just a great place for speakers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and very good place of living.
But we don't know much more about talks, so our work here and in other moons will help more than what they need for the best."
He highlights the importance of testing the presence of speakers before he drives the rehabilitation of the maturity, because it can uncertainly destroy one seat by killing 400 lambs and young talks that will lead to a complete destruction of local population.
The said is under the guard, and they are prohibited to kill, fear, disappoint, or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Feral, the worker of the Organization on the dead talks in Switzerland, helps publicity in this matter.
She says, "We need to learn much more about our talks, and many of the species we don't even know how to live their popularity."
Ranald commits accusations in force, and his judges are going to fall into the court of German journal
Christian Ranald called his accusation in strengthening his "famic news", saying that people want to "reclaim themselves" using his name.
His judges are going to be sent to court on the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published these accusations.
Forward of Portuguese Church and Yuventuse was an accusation of the strengthening of Catherine Mayorga in the athletic room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then if he had paid her 375 000 dollars for silence, he wrote on Friday Der Spiegel.
In Instagram Live, 33-year-old, Ranald returned to 142 million of their signatures in a few hours after the publication of accusations, called this message "Father News".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today the messages are fake news," said a five-fold golden sword owner before the camera.
"They want to make an advertising on my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but it's part of my work.
I am a happy and good man," he added with a smile.
The jury of Ranald's right to judge against Der Spiegel on the issue of accusations called "incomplete reports of misunderstandings in private case", reports the Agency Reeʹs.
Christian avocate Sherz said that the player would need a compensation for "a moral damage in a sum that corresponds to the difficulty of the rights, and in the approximate years this may be the most serious rights."
As if the incident had a place in June 2009 in the luminous room of Palms Houtell and Casinov in Las Vegas.
Meeting in the night club of Ranald and Mayor would have returned to the football room where he would have strengthened her analyzally, as written in the documents of the surrounding court of Clark in Nevada.
Mayorga states that after that, Ranald was involved and said he was "99 percent" that was "good boy" who was born from "one percent".
The documents say that Ranald admitted that they had sex, but they agreed on the sides.
Majorga also states that she went to the police and made a worm damage in the hospital, but then agreed to a criminal regulation, because she was very scared of mysteries, and she was unfair that she was "governmentally income".
The 34-year-old woman says that now he wants to renew the accusation because he feels a moral trauma in that case.
In time, Ranald's case was going to go to the Madrid Real from Manchester Younaitid, and this year he went to the Italian Euventus, closing the share of 100 million euros.
Braxy: Great Britain "forever I'm worried" for car builders
Greek Clark, the Grand Bretagne, 'forever,' said when he set up his status of the world car leader after Braxy, the Ministry of Business.
He added that it was a "inquired" to the Toyota UK company for BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a reminder, the company is timely to make the productivity in Bernstone, unless Darby is half.
"We need a reminder," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the delay has been affected by Braxy's result without a reminder can lead to the workplaces.
Toyota Auris and Avensis have been exported to the other Eurosays in the past year in the area of Bernstone, 150 000 cars, from which 90 per cent were exported to the other countries of the Eurosays.
"In my view, when Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, the productivity will stop," said Marvin Cook, director Toyota in Bernstone.
Other automobile manufacturers in the United Kingdom have asked how a cross-border gangle would be when the United Kingdom will come out of the EU without a reminder.
BMW, for example, states that will close the Mini command in Oxford for month after Braxy.
The main disaster is related to that car builders are talking about the risk of the lamps of the bridge resulting from Braxith without a reminder.
The Toyota manufacturer line works on the basis of "exactly in terms" when the reserve parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers and in the United Kingdom and in the EU for cars in order.
When Great Britain leaves the EU 29 March without a reminder, there may be interruptions that lead to delay and failure.
Toyota will not be able to keep in Darbie more than the share, the company stated, so the production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark stated that "Plan Checkers" Teresa May about the future relationships with the EU "to avoid these tests at the border".
"We need a reminder. We want to get the best memory that will allow not only sleep today but also use this option," he said in the program Today on the BBC Radio 4.
"The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other producers suggests that we should have the opportunity to continue working successfully."
Toyota's company has not been able to report how long the productivity will work, but for the future it has warned that the cost is to reduce the competitiveness of the business and leads to the employment.
Peter Civilris, who works 24 years in Berneston and is a professional co-ordinator, said that the members of the profession are very concerned, "When the workplaces are broken, they will not be renewed again.
The President of the Government said, "We proposed a precise plan for our future relationships with the EU, which serves confidence."
The White House states that the Tromp with Rosenstein can be replaced again
The very important meeting of Donald Trompa with the assistant of the general prosecutor of Rod Rosenstein can be "leaving yet a week" while fighting around the candidate in the main court of Breta Kawano, the representative of the White House stated on Sunday.
Rossstein watchs the work of a special adviser Robert Muler, who learns the position of the choice from Russia, the relationship of Trompo's partners with Russia and the patent prevention of justice by the president.
Let the Trump release the assistant of the general prosecutor or not, and thus put it under a threat of Muler's independence, the olive in the fire of your Kings.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had a chance to take a hidden microphone to write a conversation with Trump, and the possibility of the president to get out of the station with 25 per cent.
Rozenstein decreased this.
But last Monday he went to the White House among the hearing of what he's going to fall into the divorce.
Instead, it was announced that in Thursday there will be a meeting with Trump, which was at the time in the United Nations apartment in New York.
Thrump said he wouldn't want to call Rosenstein, but later the meeting was rejected to avoid meetings in the legal secretary, where Kawano and one of the women who accused him of sexual demand, Christine Blace Ford.
On Friday Thrump commanded to carry out the week's investigation of the FBI's statement against Kawano, which has even more voting in Senate.
The first Shortcut of the Trumpa Sara Sanders appeared in a Sunday Fox News Sunday program.
When she asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the pack is not appointed for this week, perhaps for a week, maybe for a time, and I think that, soon, a week later, all the other things are taken into account in the case of the Court of Justice.
But it's going to happen, and I always give the newest information."
The journalists are ready to discuss her statement: Sanders did not make briffins for the press in the White House on September 10.
By running the program, Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rare briffins you're not able to compare to telecommunicators who're working in the public, even though she added, "I remember the fact that they're working for the public."
Then she said that the immediate contact of the Trump and the presses to increase.
"The president has a more meeting with the answers to the question of the press than any of the presidents who were before him," she said, "We have learned these numbers."
Briffins are happening, reported Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States, it's much better than to do it through me.
We're trying to do this often, you've seen how we've done it in the appointment of a few of you, and the meetings that you can ask the president directly to replace the brifgy."
The Trump of the rule answers the question if it leaves the White House or takes part in meetings on the street, or at the press conferences with high alien guests.
The president's own president's conferences are rare.
In this week, the president in New York showed why, when free and sometimes, it was extremely in front of the reporters.
The Ministry of Defense has written to workers from the EU's country in the Spanish Protection System before Braxit
The Ministry of Defense has written to workers from the EU who work in the stock system of Scotland to express thanks for the country's name and want them to stay and after Braxy.
Jen Friman sent a letter less than half a half years before the United States out of the EU.
The Switzerland Government is ready to cover the cost of survival from citizens of the EU who work in the country's state services.
In his letter, Mrs. Fryman wrote: "In a year, there were negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the outcome of our country, which lead to the expected decisions of this east.
But the British government also accelerated the preparation for the center without a reminder.
I know that for all of you it's a very unfortunate time.

Foreign British unmovings will pay greater posts
According to the new conservatory plan foreign buyers of the British incapacity will pay a higher post, and additional money will go to help unfair
This acting neutralizes counting rapidly initiative Corbine on the attachment of young electors
Superior of the State sentence will be acquired of those who don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Financial ministers are planning to get up to 120 million pounds per year for helpless
Today, Teresa May tells you that the foreign British unmovable buyers will pay a higher state sentence, and the additional money will go to help unnecessary.
This is being considered as an attempt to neutralize the successful initiative of Jeremy Corbin for the attachment of young electors, and still the available area. It's directed to people with high income.
The highest of the State sentence is addressed to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, but the money received will go to a military program for living freedom.
The highest of the current state sentence, including and higher than two years ago, to buy other houses and lives to take, can set up to three percent.
The Financial Ministry hopes to get up to 120 million pounds per year.
Approximately 13 percent of new buildings in London are buyed by unresidents of the Great Britain, which leads to the increase of the cent, and the new buyer makes it hard to buy his first place.
Many many regions of the country, especially the chair, have been made by "towns-provided" because a large number of buyers are not living in Greece.
The new policy appeared literally through a few of you after Barry Johnson's responsibility to reduce the state sentence for young buyers to facilitate the first place.
He accused great building firms with a high center of immobility through the deception of the earth and the use of it, and for Mrs. May's rejecting the quotas for a available place to make a "governmental position with the oil" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin has made a voice series of livelihood reforms, including the control of the resources and the stop of the "inconsistent" exhibition.
He also wants to send to the local advice more powerful in the area of the building of life.
Mrs. May said, "In the past year, I said that I dedicated my job at the stage of the British Marie renewal, and that for each new generation, it must be better.
This means better than our unusual life market.
The British will always be open for those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is wrong that persons who do not live in the United Kingdom and foreign companies can buy incapacity also easily as well as the workers of the United States.
For a lot of people, they have their own houses to do more ineffective, and the problem of unreality remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambitiousness is to manage Shatland's cousin."
Jack Ross said that his main ambition is ever to be a Shatland trainer.
The 42-year-old shotlandian performs the task to renew the club from the north-east, which is now on the third place of the first line, three points from the first.
He moved to this work for a year, after returning "Sen-Maren" to the Shotland P'er-ligue in the mining season.
"I wanted to walk for my country as a player.
But it did not," Ross said in the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"I am growing up, often injured by Switzerland at the "H-Phen" stadium with my father, and something always made me back.
But this is the possibility to appear when I'm a successful club trainer."
Meanwhile Rose's earlier traveller Dick Advocate, David Moss, S.A.A., Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Gus Poye and Paula di Canya.
The former Atomic trainer says that he didn't feel afraid of such known names in such a big club, before rejecting the proposals from Barnsley and Ipsweet Town.
"Now I'll be able to answer the question," or can I return this club to 'er Liga? "
Concording structures and material bases of the club's place is certainly inside the Liza'er," he said.
"I don't just turn him back there, but I'm going to count my work successful only if I can return the club there."
Ross works only for three years as a trainer, before that he was a trainer in Damberton, and he worked 15 months in the tranner station of Harts.
Then he helped "Aloo" to return with the third line and transformed "Sen-Myren" from an unfortunate man who had gone to the Chipianship to the victory of the season.
Ross says it's now feeling more comfortable than during his career in Clay, Harttel, Falkirk, San Marin, and Ha'ilton Academical.
Remembering the Hallo work, he said, "This was really important choice."
"I really believed the trener work is what I need, even more than the game.
It sounds incredible because I worked well, worked well, and got some heights.
But the game can be hard.
There are many things to do every week.
I'm going through this now when talking about stress and pressure, but the trener work is what you need.
I always wanted to train, and now I'm concerned about this, and this is the best time for me for all my adults."

Weather and impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when the talk is about sales on the public food market.
It's not surprised that the restaurants continue to fight because the sale was decreased by 4,8 percent per year, and it's very uncomfortable if they continue to cost.

The advertising of a little mum, where mothers are compared to the rocks, shared the views on the Internet
The company on the production of little pumps divided the opinions by releaseing the advertising that compares the feeding women with the crafts that rain.
In order to indicate that they call "the first of the world's little pump" the use company Elvie has released a iranian musical advertising on the basis of the video to be free of this device to the mother's food.
Four of the two mothers dance in the coat with the song, where there are words, "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a wheat" and "I don't know if you have not noticed, it's not my breast."
And he sang, "Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I give my wives."
However, the advertising that was located on the Facebook company page, you put a bitter debate on the Internet.
77,000 views and comments: the video reaction was incompatible, many said that it was a threat of small production.
"It's very powerful to use craves for the reklame of this product.
Like we, they have to pressure and be born to give milk, here only their children choose through a few years,” wrote one watchman.
Elvie's little pump is hidden in a bustgalter for food (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "What's traumatic for your mother and for your child.
But why don't you use them to advertise a little mystery for a mother in which they don't take children?"
Someone added, "That's an unprocessed advertisement."
Others protected the advertising, and one woman wrote that they were counting the song "forgetting."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would like to have such a thing if I had a breast-feeding.
Removing milk forces me to feel a coat.
It's a little bad reklame, but I liked it.
It's a genial product," she wrote.
Another comment: "The very diverted advertisement of a mother who rejects a milk pump (often at work or at the toilet) and hears "cows".
This advertising doesn't accept or condemn the small industrial."

With children-immigrants without a brilliant voice to transport into a local camp at the Thailand border
Although the border was not changed in the month, the number of migrants arrested, partly the cause of this is to serve a severe ritoric and politics governing the Trump administration, which took care of the place of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants that are cared to put their own lives in the country, taking responsibility for a child.
The risks have grown in June when federal authorities have noticed that the patent sponsor and other full-year members of the masters will need to fall down the fingerprints and the data will be transferred to the immigration body.
In the last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-cooperator of the Immigration and Mut Service, expressed before Kongress with a report on the arrest agencies of decades of people who were asked to sponsor involving non-compliance.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested before had no judges.
"And about 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of their masters are illegal in the country, and a significant part of them consists of aliens with criminal minerals.
So we are trying to continue persecuting such people," said Mr. Olbens.
For the faster training of children, the leaders have introduced new rules that some require to be in court for a month from the date of detention, for example, according to the words of employees, the standard time of 60 percent.
A large number of people to make a statement of their own legal status to the immigration court should be used for video relations, not for a personal court.
Those who have no reason to show help are quickly deporting.
According to the words of the recipients and messages from the sources of the system, which have appeared in a month of approximately less than the children remain in disappointment, the higher probability of depressing or increasing unfortunateness that could lead to explosions of depression or trials.
The lawyers say that in greater institutions such as Tarnelli, these problems are very stronger, since the arguments that the child is in a quiet state, with greater probability, will be ignored because of the size of the rebellion.
They add that through the movement of children to a holiday mountain without providing time for emotional preparation or to develop with friends, it can be worse than a lot of people have met.
Syria requires an immediate output of the United States, France and Turkey
In turn to the General Assembly of the UN Minister for Foreign Affairs with Valid al-Mual, also because of the Syrian villages to return home without a war that continues in the eighth year.
The Mual, who is also the leader of the minister, stated that foreign forces are illegally on the Syrian earth, on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and "their will be considered accordingly."
"They must go immediately without any conditions," he said at the meeting of the Assembly.
Mualim insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions of people have had to throw their ladies, "The war with terrorism has been practically ended."
He announced that Damask intended to continue "building the holy battle, since we will not clean all Syrian territories" and "love of illegal foreign presence".
In Syria, there are about 2000 US military soldiers who are mainly playing a role and actors and advisers of Kurds and Syrian Arabs who are in the position of president of Bashar Asad.
France's earthly continent in this devastated war country consists of more than 1000 soldiers.
On the question of the Virgins, Musal said that the conditions for returning are "second western countries" in the "all-term irrational fears" containing foreign victories.
"We follow international society and humanitarian organizations to put them back," he says.
"They politics only humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to renew, since there will be no political memory of the end of the war between Asdam and the oppositions.
The United Nations diplomates report that the recent memory between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a clipboard zone in the ape-small of the Idlibe-residents has created an opportunity for political talks.
The Russian-Turic memory has produced a wide range of Syrian forces supported by Russia in the region where three million people live.
However, Musa emphasised that the reminder had “exact terms” and showed hope that military actions would be guided against the Jehudists, including the number of babies related to the Al-Qaiday front of Nusra, which would“be destroyed”.
The UN State of the Mystery is expected in the nearest time to attend the first meetings of the new committee, in which the representatives of the Government and the position will be introduced to develop a successful constitution for Syria and put the way to the elections.
Mual expressed the terms of the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, saying that the Commission's work should be limited to "the view of the articles of the current constitution" and a warning of the constitution.
Why Trump will go to the second time
In this logic, Mr. Tromp will win in the elections of 2020 when, as many liberal viewers hope, the empire and the scandal will not end the presentation.
And this will, of course, be the "The only dramatic final of the presentation of all the story."
At this time, there is no sign of the spectator's delicateness.
Since 2014, the ratings have grown more than twice, up to 1,05 million CNN and three times up to 1,6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nilsen, in Fox News in the average 2,4 million viewers in the interval, compared to 1,7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC channel was assembled at the screen 3,5 million viewers and overcome the recycling of chat television at the evening when the main news were translated.

Who the cousin said to her that he would vote for the Lord of Trump.
- Why? - she asked.
He answered, "Why he's enjoying me," Mrs. Scowell said to me.
Haos is valuable even to that that can be rejoiced.
Of course, in the contrary to all other televisions, the conveying lines out of Washington can be the same definite future as the "Ray against Wayd"'s case, whether the immigrants are able to join and get the world economy.
Ignoring is a degree that can only allow the most privileged viewers.
Yet, when you see six hours as a group of experts refers to the use of Bob Woodward "not information for" in the book "Strah", Paul Manfort's cut for 15,000 dollars with the skin of the skin (a clothing, a conscious illness as written in The Washington Post), and the strict descriptions of Stormam Daniels, Hmm, anatomy of Mr. Trompa, it's going to be a simple worrying course.
I, for example, will never look at the Super Mary as before.
"A part of what he does, it makes you feel like if you look at the reality-sheets that he's dema every night," says Brant Montgomery, executing the Wheelhouse Entertainment Director and the Creator of Pawn Stars, on the variable accuracy set of the Thrompa show and the continuous turns of the south, "Wheelhouse Entertainment" and "Pawn Stars".

When I talked to Mr. Fleece this week, behind the windows of his house on the north side of Cooi stood a beautiful sunday and 30 degrees heavy, but he sat inside and looked at MSNBC, as he wrote CNN.
He couldn't be thrown, not when Bratt Cavana was raised before the Court of Senate's Court, discussing the future of the Court of Justice, which is a wall.
"I remember the kids when we left these stupid glasses, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the west civilization," Mr. Fleece told me.
"I thought it was a jewel, but it was that they had the right."

External currency flows are involved in a severe pre-defined range of intermediate choices in the representative palace

USA assessed the possibility of Salvador to support China, and then rejected
The diplomates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama were still supporting Pekin's position, unless they believed in an insignificant contrast from Washington.
Mr. Tromp met with the President of Panama, Juan Carlas Warel in June 2017, and seated at the hotel in Panama, since partners did not send the leader command of Trompa.
The representatives of the state-department decided to deal with the American diplomatic mission managers from Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama in relation to the "recent decisions of Taiwan's unapproval", he said to Hesser Nevert's officer at the beginning of this month.
However, the sanctions were considered only in the opening to Salvador, which received about 140 million dollars of American aid in 2017, in the number of controls for drug protection, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions that include the shortcut of financial assistance and objective limitations for the exhibition of vice, would be painful for the country of Central America with its highness of unemployment and murder.
At the end of the internal meetings, the representatives of the North and Central America deployed the Implementation of the Conference on the High Conference, the Delighted Security and Economic Development, which would become a similar meeting in the past, which was considered as a step in the efforts to promote immigration in the United States.
But to mid September, high-level representatives of the administration continued to say that they wanted the conference to happen and actually stopped the consideration of the issue of the Salvador.
According to the diplomat, Vice-President Mike Pensy will now speak on a conference, which is appointed in the middle of October, as a sign that the administration is being executed.
And three American sentences without a loud voice returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard posts or posts from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the debates details described by three American factors, in the number of two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues in terms of anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by another, close to the administration of an analytics, who also wanted to remain anonymous.

The next step can be a report of the special prosecutor Robert Muler on the crucial prevention of justice by Mr. Trompham, which is currently very difficult evidence in public characters.
It is reported that Mr. Muler took note in investigating the possibility of interviewing the Trump and Russian company in an attack on elections.
When Congress changes the lady, Mr. Tromp is apologizing before the face of responsibility before this body, as he is trying to speak again before the electors, and maybe in the final result, before the jury from the number of his colleague.

What happens when Mr. Tromp releases the general prosecutor Rod Rozenstein, a man who controls the benefit of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein was dismissed in a difficult position since the hostel wrote about what in the past year he proposed secretly to write the words of the president and discussed his profoundness.
Mr. Rosensteina says the Times translation is not valid.

Maybe at the end we've killed the sword, but in the whole node also became a good result.

The last year was defined as hard as because of my trials, as well as the change in the club, but now we have a factor of confidence.

I hope we can move forward, overcome the outcome of the past season and go to the past."
Women lose sleep because of fear of pensions
Unless they believe that the demand participants had a exact imagination of what they want to watch for themselves, a few of them talked about it with their families.
About half people who participated in general research reported that they talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term monitoring.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about it to their children.

Your choice of financing for long-term monitoring can include a traditional security policy of long-term monitoring, a hybrid security policy that will help to cover these expenditures or you can self-secure your own, if you have money.
Please resolve the case with legal documents: see the court battery.
Get your trust in a medical service to assign a trusted person to control your medical service and to ensure that you do your special desires if you can't talk.
Moreover, consider the possibility of delivering confidence in financial management.
Please specify a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure the payment of your accounts if you are unable.

"The cheer plan is among the wide public, the position is not going to vote for it, it's inappropriate in our party and actives who actually go out on the street and choose us.
Please refuse the plan and start listening."
In a close way to Mrs. May, she added, "Premier ministers are staying on the step when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Farage said that politicians need to “remember discomfort” when they are going to deal with the decision adopted at the 2016 reference.
"This is the question of confidence between us, people and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to deliver Braxyto, and we're here today to say, "It's not going out of your hand."
In his turn to the west crowd, he added: "I want you to make our politicians who are ready to deliver Braxy, feel discomfort.
"We mobilize the national army of this country, which has given us a victory in Braxy, and never be calm, since we will not become independent, self-controlled, the Great Kingdom."
At the time, the workers of the outcome passed through the Arming before taking a twenty-year mining in the center of the city.

Botas's exhausted a good place on the whistle and left Hamiliton for the freedom of grass, as he protected his place on the first two virgins and invited Fetel to attack his friend by the command.
The first feet went on the pit-stap and left Hamiliton to swallow at the end of the total mass of the winds, just this monster had to be exhaustive.

It was like a wooden language of the body

"It's the only thing that can happen, and it's beautiful what happens in the appointment of a few ions in the Senate, it's when you see the wrath when you see the wicked, the wide, and the glorious people," he said.
"If you read about the pre-release and run, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Dyna Finstein, is it your run?
Remember her answer... You lost the document, "hey, hey, what?
No, no.
There was nothing from me."
Wait a minute.
No, we haven't allowed us to escape," he added to advise the senator.
Phinstein in the coat sent a letter with a detailed exhibition of the accusations made by Ford against Kawana, and he fled to the beginning of September -- but Phinstein refused that the refuge had occurred from her office.
"I didn't hide the accusations of Ford, I didn't allow her story to run," Finstein said to the Committee, "the Hill."
"He asked the story to remain confidential and I made her request."
But her refusal, probably, didn't like the president who so recommended this during the Sabbath tag, saying, "This is what I tell you, it was really a tremendous language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do that, but this is the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing the protection of the candidate in the Court of Justice, accused of three women in sex, the president showed that democracy uses accusations for their own purposes.
"They are full of determination to return to themselves the authority by any means.
You see the area, the divorce, and it is all that they hurt, through whom they should be offended to obtain authority and control,” means the president's words of the Mediate's Mediaite's.

Another charming?!
A girl from New York falls to the court of a marriage couple for a "Rissian" message after the release
A girl from New York falls to the court of a marriage couple for discrimination after receiving a case from a message from a mother with a claim that she's "once a charming one".
Parents refused to be racists, naturalizing the ears to "making".
In 2016, Lincy Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, you are disappointed by discovering that the new girl, Jizelle Morris, is a famous when she came to her first working day.
"NEEEEEE, JEHOVAH ARNASKURA," wrote Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman in the message to his husband.
However, instead of sending his husband, she twice sent a message Mrs. Morris.
As New York Post reports, with a mistake, "Flaxman felt insatisfactory" was released by Mrs. Morris, saying that the former girl, who was also African, drena was working, and she was waiting for her philippine instead.
Mrs. Morris paid the day of work and sent home to Uber.
Morris now falls on a couple in court and wants to receive a compensation for refunding in accordance with the conditions in which it is initially on the ground, even if it does not have contracts: $350 per day for six months with the survival.
"I want them to do so," she reported "Post" on Friday. "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple refused the accusation of the racism, claiming that the relief of Morris was a rational decision, counting that they didn't trust her, after they disappointed her.
"My wife sent her what wasn't supposed to be.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist,” reported the "Post" husband, Joel Plasca.
"And you'd trust your children for who's been stuck with, don't you even?
Is it not?
Are you?”
The plastic is the same as the "making" and reports that his wife has born two months ago and was in a very complicated situation.
"And are you going to persecute a man in such a position?
This is very hard,” added a specialist on investment-bank activity.

So it's nice to read, knowing about the big sleep of Paddington."
She explained that her father, who worked by the BBC operator before he insisted on writing a book for children about a small price mixture, was optimistic, unbelieving that his work was not accepted and added that in the 60th year the book was "heart-soft" after his death in the past year.
She added that her father was quietly honoured by his final speech, talking about Paddington, which she describes as a very important member of our family.
"He was a very quiet man, and totally not exciting," she said.
"But as long as Paddington was for him so real, it was a father's honour for a child that had happened: you're honouring them, although it's not really your servant.
I think he's looking at the sleeve Puddington just in such keys.
Although it was his thing, the product of his imagination, he always gave the right thing to Paddington himself."

And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetie.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave to fear her heart, quietly left her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the most end.
I just wanted to sit there, knowing that there all was crazy.
I couldn't weep, neither cry, nor weep, for I were family and people around me.
I had to keep."
Finally, Mrs. Eddin Laperus, who survived the daughter, seated in a plane together with other passengers -- and they didn't know what she had to go through.
"Nobody knew," she said.

She said that his death was a big triumph for them, but it was to live with this: "The family has appeared a big cup.
It just kills us.
But we need to continue to live and fight."

Why don't Mr. Kawano and his republican guardians want the FBI to investigate?
Their desire is sometimes explained.
Internal choices through five you were, 6 November -- when the Republics, as expected, suffer a parasy, then they will be pleased in their trials to choose the high court of the candidate needed.
George Bush called a Senator to prolaborate the support of Mr. Kawano, who worked in the White House during the presidency of Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as a personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishs his report?
There's a vote in Senate, where now is 51 Republic and 49 democrats.
Nothing, or whether Mr. Kawano will receive at least 50 votes during the vote in Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Penso to resolve the problem of votes and confirming it in the Court of Justice.
The number of winners from North Korea was decreased at the Kim Government
The number of winners from North Korea in South Korea was declined from the time that Kim Chan Ian came to the government seven years ago, stated a South Korean leader.
Bo Sun again, bringing data to the South Korea Ministry for the United Nations, stated that in the past year there were 1127 winners, and in 2011 2706.
Mr. Park stated that the main reasons are a strong memory control between North Korea and China and higher costs that have set up counterparts.
Phen'ian didn't comment this.
Most of the winners from north with the reason why they get the citizens of South Korea.
Seul states that more than 30,000 lives in North Korea have passed the border illegally after the end of the Korean war in 1953.
The majority flee through China, with which the longest limit in North Korea is simply to go to the Demilitarized Zone between two Koreans, which is very strongly dealing with.
China views the winners as illegal migrations, not the winners, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which technically are still in the state of war, has been very improved in months of approximately.
In the first month, the leader of two countries met in Phenyana for the convictions related to the denuclearisation.
This happened after the historical meeting of the US President Donald Tromp and Kim Chen Ina in June in Singapore when they agreed in general terms for the purpose of delivering from the nuclear weapons of the Korean island.
But on Saturday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the North Coreee Ian Ho accused of American sanctions from that time.
"No confidence in the United States will be no confidence in our national security, but in such conditions we will not be weapons first," Mr. Rhy said in terms of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy called Brat Kawano as hissterical, she says he shouldn't work in the Universal Court.
The leader of minority in the house of representatives of Nancy Pelozy called a candidate in the Court of Justice of Bretagne Kawano as a "histeric" and said that, at his time, he did not work in the Court of Justice.
The Pelosian said this in the interview on Saturday on the festival release of Texas Tribune in Ostin, the state of Texas.
"I couldn't imagine that if a woman had done so, she would be called "isteric", they called Pelozy about her reaction to Kawano's speaking before the Secretary Committee on Juridic Senata on Thursday.
Coffee is a social accusation of sexual accusations to the Christmas blaze Ford, when they were still teenagers.
During his incoming speaking, Kawano was very rational, sometimes he cried and couldn't even speak when his family and his older school classs were discussed.
He also expressly accused democrats in the committee, calling accusations against his "greetical and organic murder of persons", an organ of freedoms, which was disappointed because of the fact that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelozy stated that the expression of Kawano showed that he couldn't work in the Court of Justice, because he clearly showed that he had the power against democrats.
"I think he was devastating himself by his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
The Pelozy warned when she asked if she would try the Kawano Imperiment when they chose it and when the democrats received most of the representatives in the Court of Justice.
"I'll say so -- if he doesn't say to Congress or to the FBI, he should not only work in the Court of Justice, but in the court where he works now," Pelozy said.
At this time, Kawano judge of the surrounding court of the Court of Calumbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the democratic party, Kawano's patent decisions against the law of a available medical or in fact Row against Wayd, because Kawano is considered a conservative court.
At the hearings of confirmation on the Kawano stage, he didn't answer the question whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Court of Justice.
"Now isn't time for historical, unobjective persons to work in the court and wait from us the words "what wonderful it is," Pelozy said.
And the woman must take it.
It's an accusational speech, months and years of wrath just goes over, and she can't remember it without lazy.
"We're crying when we're disgusting," Mrs. Stein told me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's so rare."
She continued: "I'm very lucky for a woman who worked somewhere as a director, and who said that when she was, she was crying, but she worked a technic behaviour, and when she began to cry, she said to the converses, "You might think I'm worried because I'm crying.
But I'm crazy."
And it's just going to be a conversation.
I think it was great."
Sleeps are allowed partly as the output of the sum, because they are absolutely wrong from the dead.
One of my lightest reminders of the first work, on which I once wept from an unexpected evil, then I got for a young woman, a stuck head, who always hurt me a little - and then put me on the east.
"Never let you see in the lakes," she said.
"They don't know you're hungry.
They think you're sorrowful and will be happy that they have given you."
The Patricia Shrodar, then the Congressman Democrat from Calarad, worked with Gerry Hart in the presidential company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt was packed on a wedding in the jack, named Monkey Business, and went out with a presidential round, a very disgraced lady, Mrs. Schodar counted that she could also share in the presidential company.
"It wasn't a very well-determined ration," she laughed, she said to me 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates, and I was totally unnecessary to them.
Someone named this situation "Sweet and Seven Gnoms".
Since the company had gone too long, she had no tools, so she said that she wouldn't take part in the choices if she wouldn't buy two million dollars.
It was an emergency situation.
And it's that some of her injuries who charged the men 1000 dollars gave her only 250 dollars.
"They think I'm going with a cock?" she thought.
When she said that she would not participate in a choice company, she had so strongly kept emotional -- thanks to people who supported her, the crime of a system that so much complied with the receipt of money and directed to the electors, not to the candidates, and to the wrath of sexism -- that she had lost a spirit.
"You would think I've had a nerve breath," Mrs. Brother remembered the reaction of the press on her.
"It was possible to think that my corporate sponsor is the manufacturer of the paper serums of Kleenex.
Did I ever think they were writing on my supermagaine stone?
"He was crying?"
Why the trade war between China and the United States can be good for Pekin
The first challenging village between China and the United States was awakened, and the number of wars were far from the end, in a remote perpetuity of disappointment between the countries could be for the use of Pekin, saying experts.
The President of the United States Donald Tromp struck the first warning at the beginning of this year by putting the tax on the main export partners of China, including solar panels, table and aluminium.
The most important scale has occurred in this week when new tariffs have covered a total of 200 billion dollars (150 billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion bills bill billed up bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill .
Each time, Pekin answered the same way, taking up recently five to ten percent of the American partners $60 billion.
China killed the United States a symmetrical response, and the other, at the size of the economy, is about or by the eye.
To make Washington fall, you need to deepen in the need, but a public relief before the United States is practically unpremiable for the Chinese leader Si Zhinpin.
However, experts say that if Pekin uses the situation, the pressure of the United States trade war in a remote perival can support China, reducing the mutual stability of these two countries.
"The fact that the quick political resolution in Washington or Peking can create conditions that start the process of a strict economic fall is much more uncertain than the observers had considered before," said Eradwell Grace, a researcher who is specialized in Asia, in the research-analytic center of the new American security.
The Syrian 'prepared' to return the winners, says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with
Syria states that she's ready to return to the villages and helps to rebuild the country, a devastated war, which has been longer than seven years.

"In today's situation in the country is more stable and uncertain, thanks to progress in combating the terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas devastated by the terrorists to return to the normal.
Now we have all the conditions for returning the winners to the country they have been forced to leave from the terrorism and the direct economic measures that were guided to better than the same activity and the means of the same activity.
UN believes that more than 5.5 million Syrians left the country from the beginning of the war in 2011.
More than six million live in the country require humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualam said that Syrian regime would be happy to take help to rebuild a devastated country.
However, he highlighted that the country would not take aid to exchange certain conditions or help from the country who sponsored the competitors.

The American American writer was shot with a five and four player with the most highest ratings in the European command, Thornbyern Olsen from Danish.
The world's top player of Dastin Johnson, played 2 and 1 Yenu Paulter from England, who may have played in his ape kitchen of Raydar.
The wind of the eight cubits of the Rider's island, Serhai Garcia, made a player, who has more than all wins on a tournament with 25.5 pounds.
"No, usually, I don't cry, but today I can't go.
It was a hard year.
I am very thankful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to return the cube.
It's all about the command, and I'm glad that I could help," said the confusion of Garcia after the victory of the European command.
He delivered his staffe to his land John Rama, who on Sunday played the American golf of Tyger Woods in the only mosques two-three
"I'm very surprised by the winning in Tiger Woods, a man whose career was born from childhood," said 23-year-old Rome.
Woods has lost all his four mothers in France and now has a recurrence 13-21-3 in the Rider Cube.
A wonderful statistic of one of the biggest players of all the time, who wined 14 main titles and left on this point only from Jack Niclauss.
The American command was fighting for the exclusion of Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tni Fine, who played throughout the tournament of a high-scale golf.
The American captain Jim Furry said after a disappointed game in the protection of his command, "I'm honest to these guys, they're battles.
This morning we sometimes showed Eve what they could.
We were fighting.
Let's take the heads to the honor of Thomas.
He's a big captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're overground, I'll work with the American Golf Association and our Rider Cube Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm surprised that I am their captain.
Take a head before them.
We've been played."
