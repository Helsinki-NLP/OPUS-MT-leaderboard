Governing speaker Steffen Seibert defended the output of a journalist from the press conference of Kanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) and the Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Office, the Turkish journalist who lived in Hamburg had translated a T-shirt with the Turkish and German record "Freeness for Journalists" and was moved to the first row.
The T-shirt, if it wasn't the problem, said Sibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a breakdown of the end of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has occurred a strong injury, which is not acceptable.
That is why he allowed persons to bring out the man.
Sebert said that it was not able to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Conference.
This is absolutely independent of whether it is a justified case.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Of them shall be provided for common spionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gulen movement.
The Turkish leader makes the movement for the failed puzzle trial on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists drowned a few years of prison.
In addition, foreign journalists are not safe before the Turkish authorities: First beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.

München: Florian David Fitz completely drinked with Ina Mämer
So fresh and well-respecting knows his fans usually: Florian David Fitz.
You have to see that two times, yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular player was in Hamburg and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas night" produced by the NDR is in the theme of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfish posts".
Moderatorin Ina Mâer stops with her guests on some birds, some wine or even higher trees to revoke the voice and tongue.
Not few promises are also acknowledged by the mandatory institutions.
On Friday, there was another result of the popular Talkshow.
This time: the Florian David Fitz player from movies such as "men's herds", "Terror - your judgment" or "The Yellow Day".
The Münchner was not good for the flight to the high north.
On Saturday, he put a sellfie - his face is completely cut off, and the eyes are only two small shirts.
The bed-selfia shows a completely equipped Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just a strong catcher.
To his fans, he posted some - of course not very serious - recognitions he has now won: "Regulation one: I don't go to Inas night.
Rule 2: never drink the black sau.
And Spritz.
And the egg liqueur, the Ina mixes about half three, also leaves away.
The alcohol consumption is actually written to the 43-year-old.
His fans just sent a few tips to control the neighborhoods.
They offer instant breasts, fish breasts or - probably in the most target - head pain tablets.
Others simply amazed the view of the normally attractive kinosar.
As Ina Mâer has overcome the night-support, it is not too.
Since she moderates the TV space on the Theke but since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tested...
On a beer with Ina Mämer.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and irritation
The income in the 36 km long road road in the red captain country in Treysa is severely discoverable.
Recepts against the grassing vandalism are searched, but solutions are not able.
Snippets, cigarette kits, MÃ© and unrat, demolate MÃ©mers and middlely demounted indication sheets - so it is present since the longer of the income with a group of seats to the road on the haasse wheel in Treysa.
For the preview object, a road roadway in the red captain country is more than an inreligious view.
The subject is employed by members of the ADFC-local group Schwalmstadt, but others are already longer, thus the Ulrich Wüsthagen Radiator.
The problem has already been addressed in the Radiation Board.
Don't give a solution until now.
The proposals decline from the settlement group to regular training of the waste containers and purification of the areas at the entrance.
"I think the last thing would be the order of the hour - independent of possible other Assets," says the wilderness.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the subject was also introduced into the local office.
Not only the M日 tree of radiators and residents - the seat group is a regular meeting point at weeks to celebrate.
It is not only often sound, it is also broken at the ships: rocks from the earth, depolated whites, rounded shields, seat mobs.
Volunteers had already cleared more often, told ADFC-Mitglied Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the speaking troops on the heavy stone.
They are surprising that the rash place is on the roadway in Treysa meeting point for the layout.
"When the whole roadway is here, it is clearly the point of the haaße road," the radio carrier, who is now concerned about the new raw stages in boxes that are open today.
"It's going to be the same shick room, it's going to be pretty closer."
Another idea is a video monitoring at the hill: "It may make it clear that the wheel is to go away from the community.
However, it would be supposed that there will be a police officer at the same time.
Basicly, the deserthagen wants a development of the Haaste hair.
He must be made attractive.
The frequency of the road to this time can be very satisfied.
The tourist discharge is still exhaustive.
Our roadway is very valuable in comparison with others in Germany," as the ADFC members.
As extremely critical agency, ADFC-Mitglied Susanne Klippers the situation in the Ascherood Street in Treysa.
There is no trip on the Haaste-Wheel.
In the king's construction, it can be expected that radiators must wait in the middle of the street between both sides of the stream," she states.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for elders and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Cultural Road Chair: The "Cook of Hiltrup" and the sea
The first call for music was a success, creative and mutual success.
"D offer a song for Hiltrup" means the call of the town partopensive helprup, in "music for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eyewears in the sympathic helper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a coffee and kitchen of the people of the cultural carrier.
Seven forms were attached from the one-man-bound to the large ene: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with gitarre, Rolf Ihmig, a long in the helprup of living albums, nine of the "Hiltruper star colors", three members and three generations of the families Trencamp and
This Contest, as told by the Department Master Joachim Schmidt, was a newness.
We haven't learned that in other cities.
What did the textures view?
At the places, the helper See and the market numbers were especially often discovered.
Rolf Ihmig cut all the song inside the shooting song to "Cook of Hiltrup".
Moreover, the Cultural Road Head was worth.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially in Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke used the short rebuilding outputs with short interviews with the interpreters or indications to their creation.
So you learned from Humberg that he studied chemie, but now he learned Gitarre.
From the Tonechniker Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that the latest occurred in Ludwigshafen - on a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic placed all this on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Frank said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the helper gastronomy.
For the favorites of the Jury, however, there was something to be able to hear their songs.
A whole CD can include Alvin Jasic and his Pianist Marcel Untied with tone technic shammelmann.
Other musicians can play a song: Ihmig with Hiltrup-scaller, who especially impressived Frank with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful income" with children and two kids of gitarre and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Titée.
Like all the children came up to the end again - and even cry without electronic support "rightly well", as Frank said.
The Jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, accession of the melodie and re-approval value.
The Jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the West Fale School for Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Agreement, as well as Jan Kaven, president of the town's shareholder.
The citizen partofficial had called the event from the result of its annual existence to life.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" soon in a very full culture chain.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players are two teams that are opposing each other.
For each side, there is a view screen in which four cards with keywords that you - the old trick with the red folie - can only determine when you have hit it.
It is thus guaranteed that the opposite cannot read nothing from disappointment.
Then on the cards, for example, read from left to right: "--Renaissance.
Window 2.
3. Worfel.
4. Festival."
These are the terms that should be encrypted.
Because the terms are not to be delivered here, but codes.
Switching a player per team is the encryptor.
He's got a code card on which it may be "3.4.2".
Not to be delivered in "Decrypto" the terms behind the secret folie, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He will - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "worpels", "Fest" and "Windows" - and so that his own team recognises the correct order and the gender team is not possible; because it wins the party if it is able to catch the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads: "Worp" for the wheels, "Lose" as an opposite to the fest; of course, there would be something like "Party" and "Prag" because he has set up in the school and knows the atmosphere of the window.
That's what's going on for, team for team.
Although you don't know the terms of the opposite - you can better compare them with any indication that the encryptor gives there.
If possible, mysterious, but not to turn away, the rescriptions should be so, elsewhere, it makes it unnecessaryly difficult.
Unfortunately, the most encrypted in Decrypto is the rule.
The players must probably study it quite long and explicitly until they can finally play.
The declaration video under decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But whoever has solved the first time will be fascinated how much feelings are in this invisible game.
However, in general, "Decrypto" is not very complete as the predators and Genre-Primus "Codenames", which also supports an agent thee on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who's just about advice and not about victory points, he can also easily find a version for two.
Kulbach: Man shows Hitler's police and beauty guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulbach at the night of Saturday on Sunday.
First, he showed in the top town of a crossing police officer to Hitler, then later he fell in the top town in a kitchen, when he embraced other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to carry the night at the police inspection Kulbach in the prison cell.
In the nearest state, he must also be criminally responsible for the use of characteristics of constitutional non-constitutional organizations.
Operation Pressig was the house of the shooter
The traveling work in Pressig was a year ago the roadshop in Frankenwald.
1991, a part of railway history ended.
"When the puffer was shot on the puffer, it was heard in full pressure," he reminds Georg Dinkel, who is the story of the place and the bathroomhof.
It's not going to stop anyone.
That's where the brems also cut off and the waggons were cut off.
That's just a clean railway.
Explain that are sensitively for Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in Frankenwald, a place was so placed by the railways.
Here was the beginning of the steilramps streams streams to the north, which, after an increase of approximately 220 metres of the height, has its separation point in Steinbach on the forest.
In order to control this, early moves and shooters were needed that pressually had their home.
1901 the Bayer Landday approved the building of a travel driving work with 21 lockshops, training facilities, driving and traveling facilities.
"Herzstuck was the trigger, which after a construction of 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," told Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, Bahnhistoric and 47 years of professional stage.
From the traveling work (BW) Pressig, which was signed in 1968 Bamberg, was also carried out for the understreak Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigs City - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Cronach - Northern side.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblad" reported from a 160-man station of 160 men; 13 dampf and eight ellocks were then stationed in Pressig.
Electricization of the stream 1939 has already minimised the need for movements and shopping.
Since 1977, they were only used for good moves.
By 1991, at least 10 000 wages were organized in the month.
1982, parts of the operation, 1991, were cancelled.
Heidrich: "It's damage that you don't have a better use of the location, even at the point of good transport, to the eye."
More on Pennsylvania 1989, the Nürnberg Travel Direction celebrated the "50 years Electricity Nürnberg - Salfeld" a pompous bathroom in Pressig.
"There were $10,000 amazed surveys here," reported Georg Dinkel.
Soon later, it's out.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were lost, the Rangier Road Hof Pressig was a story.
"The rangers and householders performed the most difficult work in the traffic," says Dinkel.
Each failure would have been fatal.
Why the trainhof Pressig-Rothen Church has led to the surrounding of the hierarchie of the two places and many other history and current pictures are here in the Infra-Plus article.

1968 - that was the time of the protest and the movement of students.
And the Albanians also made their immut air at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find out partout that after the resolution of the church "Cäcilia" there should no longer be in the city part of the church.
It has become a legend: on a bank in the tinebush, they lift the MGV 68 albums out of the baptism.
It was 50 years ago.

"It will be full of today," said President Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep right.
150 guests were a real success for the Albanian songs.
At the same time, they had allowed them to resume the festival.
For years there was a tradition, then there was a break.
At the point of 50-year-old existence, the traditional festival was back there.
A elegant ball was to be asked for a fixed clothing before.
The guests were not sitting in the "Home of the Meeting" in the rounds, but in silent boards.

First shot after a half hour
For the first (harmless) Torschuss of the whole party, Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute.
The best - and in Prince also only real - the potential of the Alleners, like Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shot from the Strategy border to a parade.
The guest providers were still worse.
The most effective action was in a early exchange.
Sturmer Lars Schröder had to be changed by the condition of hurt, for him, Sinan Aygon.

Oftensively "speaked everything so little" against a team, "which just wanted to defend.
I didn't feel that we could get an opposite," so much.

The joyful Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the rack fields of table issues for which these S日 are determined.
The honourable people are assured: "These Supples are also in the Reckenfield."

Francz Holthaus Festival organizer welcomed the guests in Kiepenkerl-outfit as always with a regular price of humor.
For the wedding Brockmann, which should be raised against food, run short-term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer.
The Verena (dochter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there's enough creimers.
And the "substitution" didn't allow it to interview musically those who were more able to be.
That was so good that some people had been sent in a few hours later.
"Easy good," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Citizen Peter Vennemeyer was able to submit the terms of the terms this time in term plan.
He rejoices in the many actives with their stages, including great unions.

Stefan Hagemeyer, who lived in Reckenfeld for a year ago, was creating at his decouper.
Furnier work, bird deck with rack fields Motiven, and some more he had in the boat.
A speciality offered three rack fields Imker: "Reckfields meat", produced by Maria-Theresiaolka, Christian Wederhoven and Helen Roth-Buschclusters.
Let's calls have another speciality.
Meat in glass, of course with milk from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to get back, so the kitchen was so smiling.
The ability is that the survivors have made a long time to the evening hours, even without a program that does not exist in the festival.
Smileys with local political message: No longer exposure for Scade facilities
In Lngerich, unknown people have made a few favorable ways for building a shadow facility.
In several places there are corresponding smileys, Jürgen Kohne says by the city manager at the WN request.
In at least one case, the police has been punished for business damage.
In large letters, the three words "Scate park for Langerich" apply to shields.
Michael Rottmann, the Manager of the Hall, reports that after 19 September the professional election mission has already been discovered a corresponding cycle on the advertising board at the stage to the command-Bistro.
Since the short message of his time was apparently left "only" with a Edding, they could be removed without problems.
"Now a few days later, then, it's going back, that's upset this time," said Rottmann.
It deems that the corresponding advertising is to be replaced.
A special note is just this case by calling on the table several large companies from Lngerich.
If the tax installation is built, their realisation will also be enabled by sponsors.
It is already said that Jörg Hesselmann is called without name from the State of the Sport, Sport and Culture.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those undertakings standing on the covered table.
Local policy and administration have been occupied for years with the subject of Skate facilities.
Following the old at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council has spoken mostly for the firewater park.
This advice was implemented in the non - too many people appeared to speak against a building at this place.
The end of June followed a rotation.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee voted for the area of the Gutenberg School.

Increasing pass on flight security becomes worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the air traffic chaos in Summer, the German flights see no signs for improvement in the next year.
"In this year we had Wind, 2019, we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the chief of the flight insurance, Matthias Maas, the German Presse Agency before the air carrier on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the number of renewments and flight accidents is the personal note since long ago in the aircraft guarantees for which there is no quick solution.
"The Airlines and the airlines can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the employer.
In Europe, the market for completely trained lotteries has been empty.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German aircrage was a hundred people.
Maas criticized again that different air traffic facilities were not invited to the wallet.
In the Hanse city, the representatives of the Federation, the countries, the aircraft, the airlines and the airports are gathered together for the causes of the latter.
"If you want to talk about social deterioration and overtimes of work, it will not go without us," said the GdF leader who has many members in the common German aircraft.
Maas has made the EU's Commission re-responsibility for Lotsen missionaries.
The previsions for the period of regulation running up to 2019 were too low.
The costs and personal expenditures resulted from it in the national flight insurance are now completely in the operational business.
Maas invited the Federal Ministry Andreas Schuer (CSU) to be used in Brussels for regulations that "not yet disturb the air."
Currently, the EU's provisions would be voted up to 2024 and there would be further disturbances.
The EU has continuous lobby printing from the airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now enjoy exactly what they have seated in the last years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high costs of renewability in the aircraft companies have been re-reviewed.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German aircraft (DFS) offers a "balanced training and future package", said Maas.
The record of 120 lotteries annually announced for the next five years was just to compare the old-related deficits.
The necessary personal building is not yet connected.
Thousands Crew Country is a valid concern number
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Council have voted on the plans for the development of the concern.
According to the will of the Thyssenkrupp Interim Chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed at the meeting on Sunday president, the Christian concerns should be assembled in two independent companies.
Both enterprises must have their seat in food and be noted at the border.
It should not be possible to have an additional personal breakdown on the already shortcomings in the administration.
After two returns, the control body on the capital side is only eight heads.
This is the representative of employees.
However, the final decision is to take a main assembly for 2020.
The new thyssenkrup materials AG will include the 50-pro part of the fusioned steel business with the Indian partner Tata.

"The nature has a position, she was already before us, and we have to guide us to her," planned the expert for fruit and nutrient trees.
Therefore, for the buildings of the garden, it gives it the encouragement to not leave our home to remain nice and lively valuable.
This is also what it is to welcome the new citizens in our United States, which the President of the Bayer Landsband, Wolfram Vatl, supplemented.

That Hardrock is not equal to Hardrock, demonstrating Gitarrist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the Bass and Slagers Kai Hölscher with their alternatives, related to classic rocks of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of "Tigers" the "Here We Stand" comes to the gitarn rock, which is also a synthesizer to use.
Not only the viewful, just too balladed "Take Me Home" leads through the exchange of Melodic Passages to the gitarric rockriffs of the many-scale songs.
Instead, the quarter "The Ignition" of Tonnehouses has played a special level of knowledge since its creation in 2005.
Full agility presents the band on Saturday its hardrock.

A certain volume belongs, however, to such a simple Hardrock concert, of course: In the "Mint Mosquito" rocknight, the sound outcome of the mixture team is at the three concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at approximately 98 decibel.
This is sometimes at the pressual chamber level, but it is still clearly under the emissions of the "Wacken-Fesitval" to the "The Ignition" on their website.
120 decibels of the ears in thiesen explosives, like the annual metal-stablelidine in the north of the Republic, usually does not have the Allen public at this rocknight.
After approximately four hours, the three bands of the stronger, rocky Gangart longer convinced their sovereign, unfortunate game and their own compositions.
"We stand here, we have taken the bones and burned a concert with the power of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the over-sensitive sense, can finally say.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the suckers.

But then there would not be 100,000 people out there in the area of this pral, but we would have only 200 people stand outside.

The next two classicians against Ajax and Gladbach are now the first interfaz for the office of Niko Kovac.

Despite the criticism of his person after the WM output and the Uzil business, he wants to candidate again to the office as DFB President in the next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as it's going," Grendel said.

And there were many corners and many bottles in our straf," the Sport Representative of Schalke 04 said and spiritized.
The king's blue was still learned to bring the first season under the cup and the rock.
That could really be different.
After the lead by Alessandro Creap 11 of Cheftrainer Domenico Tedesco's family had given security: "In sum, the first half time was good, both player and pressing here.", playing with a low playing duration, obviously, more than the head was a role.
Creator: No headball memory

With a lot of numbers, hand-fast numbers and one or another, he brings to the auditors one of the most conflicting theies closer: migration and integration.
Why does conflicts arise despite persecuted integration?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metapher.
On a table, the German society is sitting in Cathetics the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be on the table.
The generation of migrants has been born in Germany, they have always been sitting on the large table and want to vote now.
This leads to conflicts.
It's not that it's not why you're a political position right or left, but, "I'm for or against a open society?" he's saying.
In the beginning, the debate is always running.
And there is a need for talking.

For no time at the startup: however, Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsen Church - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had been seated in the Scalker Starter, but on the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been big if the nearly two meters of the big Brazilians had spoken so correctly the fruit of the soul.

"This was very emotional, that was a big sport," Tedesco later mentioned about the response of his vice-capital, who, despite his renewable reservator's dawn, had no roll.
Probably, Naldo knows, who was born in the past season as the best schalker, that he has actually not been done in the tragedy - but has a pause for reasons.
A reason called "taking tax".
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It was not easy to tell him that I tell you honestly," Tedesco reported about the moment he told Naldo that he didn't stand at the beginning.
He's a important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the unit," Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone now can shift.
And that we all keep in the ship," Tedesco said the rotation, which recently has designed Naldo.
And the Brazilians reacted with the wisdom of his progressive age: by demonstrating himself also on the bank as an example of teamplayer.
